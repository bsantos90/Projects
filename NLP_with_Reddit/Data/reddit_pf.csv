We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Find and participate in a FREE activity in your area!**  Some suggestions on how to do this:

* Search your [local community subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocationReddits/wiki/index), website, or newsletter for free activities.  These can range from free days at a local museum to free concerts in the park.

 * If you happen to live in or near a mid-sized or large city, check the local subreddit to see what type of events and meet-ups have been listed (also make sure you check their sidebar).

 * Bulletin boards at community centers, places of worship, and schools are also good places to find different activities.

* Visit a local or national park and have a picnic, go for a hike, or walk a nature trail.

* Check out some of the ""free to play"" type activities that are available all over the world.  

 * Make a ""walk in the park"" more exciting with /r/geocaching.

 * See if there is a podcast/map for a historic walking tour of your town or a nearby town, download it, and make a morning or afternoon of walking the tour.

* Set-up and run a game night or movie night with your friends.  Rather than go out for expensive fun at a bar or restaurant, stay home and have more fun with friends.  /r/boardgames has a helpful sidebar, /r/NetflixBestOf has lots of movie suggestions, and you can always ask your friends for ideas.

* Meet up with some friends in a local park for a picnic, barbecue, to play basketball or tennis, or maybe just to toss a football or frisbee around.

* Large celebrations: National holidays like the Fourth of July or local ""Heritage Weekends"" tend to have many options for free entertainment throughout town.  Check out when the next one around you is happening (hint: Fourth of July if you live in the United States).

* Volunteer for free admission.  Many events will need help with everything from ushers to clean-up and will usually allow you free admission to the event as a reward for volunteering.  Find a cause you believe in or an event you want see and see about volunteer opportunities.

  Check out [VolunteerMatch.org](http://www.VolunteerMatch.org) to see some of the endless opportunities around you.

The goal of this exercise is to show you that spending money isn’t required to have a full and healthy life.

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done one or more of the following things:

* Participated in 2 different activities around your town.

* Setup or joined an on-going activity (like a game night with friends).

* Found a free replacement for a current paid activity and at least tried it out.  This could be anything from borrowing a movie from the library to attending a free yoga in the park session.

So the inspector does his inspection and there was a multitude of expensive fixes that needed to be done, and more than I wanted to take on as a first time home buyer. Honestly I really liked how thorough and no nonsense the inspector was, thought that was what inspectors were supposed to do.

So I am back at the house hunt, and I ask the realtor (a fill in because my relator is out of town until Saturday) if I could see a house that just came on the market (shopping in the range of 120-150k and houses are moving fast). So I get to the house before my relator and noticed that paint was chipping really bad under the roof, the detached garage had rotten boards, and see that the house probably wouldn’t work either.

The stand in realtor shows up and agrees with me that the home probably wouldn’t meet the requirements for a Hope/FHA loan, even though the sheet says FHA loans were okay. We do not even go inside the house.

However I asked her a few questions about what to look for in pictures, or finding these obvious things out first so I do not waste anybody’s time. Well one thing led to another and we got onto the subject of the inspector I used on the house I liked, and she said from what my realtor told her the person I used was just too nitpicky and likened him to another inspector realtors call the “deal breaker”.

Honestly I do not know quite what to think about the conversation. I mean I should want an inspector who does a good job, but the way this relator made it sound that I would never get a Hope/FHA loan approved with an inspector like that. 

Shouldn’t I want an inspector who will be thorough at his job? I mean the appraiser will just come out later and could note those same problems, and then I am out more money than just the inspection.

 I’m getting paid for vacation I didn’t use at my job (so, all of my available vacation days since I didn’t take any this last year...or the year before that). My check will be about $3,000. 

I’m completely burned out from working so much these last few years (I worked during undergrad, and immediately after I graduated, worked 6 days a week, and finally in this last year, I was only working 5 days a week with some remote work on the weekends). 

So, my plan was to take a 10-day vacation before school starts. I already booked my flights through frequent flyer miles, but when it came time to book my hotel and rental car, the costs got overwhelming. I haven’t taken a vacation in 7 years so I was a little bit out of touch with how much hotels cost (I feel like $100/night is pretty expensive, no?). 

I cancelled my trip, and honestly I’m devastated. I was so excited. I was really looking forward to unplugging in the mountains of Washington State. 

But I figured that my money was best spent on my loans for grad school, which all-in-all will be about $25,000.  

But what’s the right balance? Did I do the right thing? Or am I always going to regret not spending some time and money on myself just so that I can have fewer loan payments after grad school is over?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to turn 26 in the end of the month, and have been struggling with credit card debt for 2 years now, mostly helping family out, didn't expect interest to hit me this hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Last February I had to quit my high paying job due to health reasons, and ended up traveling around the US searching for a new place to call home, its been 4 months now, with money still in my savings account I moved in with my sister who is okay with me staying over, just to save more money.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't pay rent, I never order take out, with two warehouse jobs right now, and my credit score just went below 600.

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice in how to increase my credit score quickly, and if a personal loan is a good idea, I have until early September to go somewhere else, I can't stay here longer than 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Any response is appreciated, I should apologize in advance if i don't reply quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for the advice everybody,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm editing this post to remind some redditors that I made this post for advice, I needed to know what are the options, whats the best way to tackle my current situation. that's all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that poor choices were made, I didn't spend money on meaningless material things, family members were stuck in a situation that I believed at the time I should lend a helping hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not here to read that I should cut out my family, and that I'm stupid and irresponsible, I should learn how to spend money first. I should quit vices like smoking or drinking. (I don't drink or smoke)  

&amp;#x200B;

The road trip wasn't planned, after quitting my job, I had nowhere to be, I just got in my car and drove. 

&amp;#x200B;

For all of you in the same situation I wish you the best of luck, there is a lot of great advice shared in these comments.

Also linguistics isn't the most marketable major and you don't even need a linguistics major to teach abroad.

I have $11,500 in credit card debt (this is both mine and my boyfriend's combined)

$1800 on a personal loan \[which is three payments behind\] (this loan was taken out after my boyfriend's father died and we had to move from Vegas to Utah and his two brothers \[27m, 22m\] and his mother moved in with us. Before this, we were so close to having our 8 credit cards paid off, had to max those out as well)

$26000 in a truck loan

$1800 overdraft at my bank

and then around $11,000 in medical bills (though that will be paid with a shitty settlement I got)

and this is not counting the thousands of dollars my dad has given me because I can't get my shit together. As well as my utility payments that are all 2-3 payments behind.

Right now, I work f/t at $16/hr, and my boyfriend works at $19/hr ""f/t"", but actually his employer sucks and he doesn't ever get his full 80 hours, and his employer takes out the drive time of going to a ton of different job sites. We rented a $1600/mo house ONLY because his brothers said they would get jobs and wanted their own bedrooms instead of sharing or sleeping in a basement. Which I should have known was total bullshit.

So, one brother, 'J' finally got a job, and he \*should\* be paying us $750/mo as well as dinners for the weekends. (only dinners, as we have never had enough money to buy things like breakfast or lunch or whatever) But, it's never actually the total payment. This one has no DL, pretty much no job until living with us, never lived outside of parent's home, the other brother. well, I could go on and on and on about this kid...

We give his mom around $80/week until she is eligible to get her husband's social security early next year, and she watches our two kids from 7am-2pm.

The younger brother. It's been a year and half of him living with us and he has never given us any money at all. He has enough money to buy alcohol and drugs, but never enough to actually help us out. I hate him. But, my boyfriend refuses to kick him out so I have to deal with it.

Anyway. So, there's that.

We spend around $200/week on food and then a lot on gas and sigh, cigarettes. There's no way that is going to be gone as an expense, everyone would go apeshit.

My monthly income is around $3500

So, my monthly expenses is as follows:

$1600/mo - rent

$900(give or take) - groceries

$400 - utility bills

$55 - phone

$400 - truck payment

$200 - truck insurance

$450 - credit cards

$55 - student loan payments

As you can see, I'm, upside down. Usually, the credit cards get taken off because, well, no money to pay them. My credit score is very low 500's as a result.

I don't know what to do. The stress is eating away at me, I wish I could just disappear and then problem solved. I absolutely hate my life because of all of this debt. I never see myself getting out of it. And my boyfriend is always getting mad at me because he doesn't fucking understand how much we make vs how much we have to spend each month even after talking to him and explaining and showing him. He refuses to talk to brother's about their payments (or when he does, they don't care), even to the detriment of our little family (me, him, our two kids). Basically, I see us never ever ever living on our own because they will always be there)

I need help.

Edit: this is also causing me to downward spiral into a deep depression and my anxiety to shoot through the roof. My outlook on life is bleak. Everything seems meaningless because I can't imagine living without this debt. It will continue to pile up and up and up. I need some good advice :(

Edit 2: The truck is only worth $9000, so we're upside-down on it, and trading it in, selling it, whatever, would just add onto what we owe.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (24f) just don&amp;#39;t know what to fucking do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have $11,500 in credit card debt (this is both mine and my boyfriend&amp;#39;s combined)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$1800 on a personal loan [which is three payments behind] (this loan was taken out after my boyfriend&amp;#39;s father died and we had to move from Vegas to Utah and his two brothers [27m, 22m] and his mother moved in with us. Before this, we were so close to having our 8 credit cards paid off, had to max those out as well)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$26000 in a truck loan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$1800 overdraft at my bank&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then around $11,000 in medical bills (though that will be paid with a shitty settlement I got)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and this is not counting the thousands of dollars my dad has given me because I can&amp;#39;t get my shit together. As well as my utility payments that are all 2-3 payments behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I work f/t at $16/hr, and my boyfriend works at $19/hr &amp;quot;f/t&amp;quot;, but actually his employer sucks and he doesn&amp;#39;t ever get his full 80 hours, and his employer takes out the drive time of going to a ton of different job sites. We rented a $1600/mo house ONLY because his brothers said they would get jobs and wanted their own bedrooms instead of sharing or sleeping in a basement. Which I should have known was total bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, one brother, &amp;#39;J&amp;#39; finally got a job, and he *should* be paying us $750/mo as well as dinners for the weekends. (only dinners, as we have never had enough money to buy things like breakfast or lunch or whatever) But, it&amp;#39;s never actually the total payment. This one has no DL, pretty much no job until living with us, never lived outside of parent&amp;#39;s home, the other brother. well, I could go on and on and on about this kid...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We give his mom around $80/week until she is eligible to get her husband&amp;#39;s social security early next year, and she watches our two kids from 7am-2pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The younger brother. It&amp;#39;s been a year and half of him living with us and he has never given us any money at all. He has enough money to buy alcohol and drugs, but never enough to actually help us out. I hate him. But, my boyfriend refuses to kick him out so I have to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. So, there&amp;#39;s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spend around $200/week on food and then a lot on gas and sigh, cigarettes. There&amp;#39;s no way that is going to be gone as an expense, everyone would go apeshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My monthly income is around $3500&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my monthly expenses is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$1600/mo - rent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$900(give or take) - groceries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$400 - utility bills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$55 - phone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$400 - truck payment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$200 - truck insurance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$450 - credit cards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$55 - student loan payments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I&amp;#39;m, upside down. Usually, the credit cards get taken off because, well, no money to pay them. My credit score is very low 500&amp;#39;s as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking for some objective advice on a possible investment opportunity.

A small holiday house on a rental plot at a holiday park became available, I heard through a friend that also has a house there. It is not in the best location in regards to being connected, but it is a great place to retreat to and the park itself has some really nice up to date facilities.

Now it is a nice small and secluded house that does need a bit of maintenance, especially the kitchen, but is overall in a pretty good shape and comes fully furnished. The buying costs are 5000 everything included, even plot rent until the end of the year. After December plot rent will be 250 a month.

Now holiday houses at the park usually go for double that amount, so I could potentially buy it and sell it somewhere in the coming year. This attractive to me because, a. profit potential, and b. I have to leave my current apartment next summer and with this holiday house I could potentially leave early and half my monthly rent for a while, which would be nice as my current contract at work expires next January and there is no chance of an extension of the contract. It can also serve as a place to retreat while I do the writing necessary for my job.

My issues are these:

* I have never spent this much money on anything before and as such am horribly inexperienced and am worried I am not seeing the whole picture.
* I could pay this whole, but it would take a big chunk out of my savings (about 2/3s).
* I would pay approximately 100 a month in fees for extras (internet, gas, electricity, water) on top of my normal expenses, which is doable, but will cut into my savings potential.
* While there is potential for profit, there is no guarantee.
* I am a bit of a homebody and I am afraid I won't make enough use of the place to warrant the expense.

I have decided that the investment in time, money, and effort it would take to make any profit  would not be worth it. As a recreation object it would not give me enough pleasure over the coming period to buy it as I would have limited time to enjoy it and I would not be motivated enough to visit enough to warrant the expense.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, long time lurker on a throwaway account here. I&amp;#39;m looking for some objective advice on a possible investment opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small holiday house on a rental plot at a holiday park became available, I heard through a friend that also has a house there. It is not in the best location in regards to being connected, but it is a great place to retreat to and the park itself has some really nice up to date facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is a nice small and secluded house that does need a bit of maintenance, especially the kitchen, but is overall in a pretty good shape and comes fully furnished. The buying costs are 5000 everything included, even plot rent until the end of the year. After December plot rent will be 250 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now holiday houses at the park usually go for double that amount, so I could potentially buy it and sell it somewhere in the coming year. This attractive to me because, a. profit potential, and b. I have to leave my current apartment next summer and with this holiday house I could potentially leave early and half my monthly rent for a while, which would be nice as my current contract at work expires next January and there is no chance of an extension of the contract. It can also serve as a place to retreat while I do the writing necessary for my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My issues are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have never spent this much money on anything before and as such am horribly inexperienced and am worried I am not seeing the whole picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could pay this whole, but it would take a big chunk out of my savings (about 2/3s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would pay approximately 100 a month in fees for extras (internet, gas, electricity, water) on top of my normal expenses, which is doable, but will cut into my savings potential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While there is potential for profit, there is no guarantee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a bit of a homebody and I am afraid I won&amp;#39;t make enough use of the place to warrant the expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

- phone 51$
- credit card (signatures I don’t want to cancel) 300$
- house bills 230$

MBA 930$

It is for about 2 years and of course many things can happen in that time. Like, getting fired. Unpredictable things can happen. Our washing machine is having problems, pretty sure it will die soon.


Ask for a loan it is not a option.

A bit of background about myself:

I have just finished my first year of university and am swiftly moving onto the next (studying in the UK). I have a summer job paying £8.21 an hour and a term time job paying a similar wage. Between this and my 4500 pound annual  maintenance loan I can take care of myself for the year. This does mean between my school fees and maintenance loan fees I am accumulating a debt of just of over 13k a year with an interest rate of about 6%. I also have access to a £1000 overdraft which has no interest for a year, not something I particularly need to use at the moment. 

I have no other significant financial barriers in my life at the moment. 

My plan 

I was originally going to put it into a savings account and an ISA but they all have crap interest rates. My current idea is to set aside a grand for any expenses that might suddenly crop up. Just leave this in a savings account taking the crap interest rate but its money that I can access at a moments notice. I was also going to put about 13 grand into a HSBC investment account, choose 6 funds and put just over 2 grand in each and watch it grow. As for the remaining grand I was going to create a standing order to put 250 pound into what HSBC call their regular saver. I can put up to 250 a month into it and im not allowed to touch it. At the end of the year they will give me 3% on what ever is in the regular saver. This obviously only gives me 4 months of run way but between birthdays christmas's,overtime,holiday pay and any money I can take out of my investment account I can cover the other 2 grand. I was also thinking the interest from this could offset any losses which might result from a bad performance of  a fund.

&amp;#x200B;

As to why im not paying off my debt. The student debt Only needs to be paid back once I make more than 27k a year. Also its more like a tax as any thing I make over 27k will be ""taxed"" at 9% (I think its 9). Not only this but the money I believe can be better spent. It can be used to cover rent for the year or used to put a deposit down on a house or buy me a car so I can commute to work. All of this gives me ""better earnings potential"" than simply paying the debt

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound like a reasonable plan and do you have any other suggestions.

She&amp;#39;s difficult to help but she&amp;#39;s my mom and I care about her and I don&amp;#39;t want her to live on the street. I live all the way across the country, so I can&amp;#39;t be of much help directly, but I&amp;#39;m flying home next week and I want to know what things I could potentially do to help her find a home while I&amp;#39;m there, and what things she can do to keep herself from ending up on the street. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance&lt;/p&gt;

Throwaway account… Need help with retired family member’s finances who is claiming they’re now destitute. Something seems fishy to me, and I need pointers on what advice to give.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finance Breakdown:**

* State of Residence: NJ
* Family Member Age: 70 (never married, no children, retired at the age of 42 in the early 90s, had inheritance from my grandmother/great aunt to live on in addition to a pension and IRA) 

**Income:** 

* $26,000 annually from social security and his pension
* Said he made $160,000 from the sale of his townhouse in 2014 (when he moved into the apartment he’s currently living in) – said he put it into his investment account, withdrew about $45,000 from it annually, and it is now gone.
* Claiming an IRA and investment account are now tapped. In 2009 or 2010, I had spoken with him and his financial advisor was present, who mentioned that there was about $1,000,000 in his investment account alone (not including social security/pension or even his IRA I don’t think) – this is what seems really fishy to me? Wouldn’t he need to be drawing something like $100k+ annually to drain that entirely by now??   


Important to note that he doesn’t make any of his own investment choices, and his financial advisor who manages his portfolio is a fiduciary advisor who has been in business for decades (the firm also handled my grandparent’s money, and also my tiny IRA)… I don’t see them making risky investments, and I thought the market had been doing well the past few years?

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses (Annual):**

* No credit card, car, or other debt.
* Rent: $24,780
* Food: $7,500
* Prescriptions: $7,200
* Country Club: $4,000
* Federal &amp; State Taxes: $3,000
* Medicare Gap Coverage: $2,784
* Tax Installment Payment (for a past IRA withdrawal): $1,800
* Medicare: $1,608
* Electric: $1,500
* Cable/Phone: $1,500
* Car Insurance: $1,400
* Investment Portfolio Management Fee: $1,000
* Medicare Part D Coverage: $897.60
* Gas (Car): $800
* Gas (Utility): $500
* Laundry / Dry Cleaning: $500
* Tax Preparation: $300
* Renter's Insurance: $125
* Apartment Maintenance Crew Gratuity: $120
* Oil Changes (Car): $100
* Car Registration: $40  


**Total: $61,454.60**

  

**My Advice Plan:**

He’s asking me to make up the difference between what he spends per year and what he makes off social security/pension per year. There’s no fucking way that’s happening. He literally spends about twice what I spend in a year (I live in a HCOL area), I just paid off my last student loan this year, finally saved up an emergency fund in 2018, and was able to contribute to my own IRA for the first time in 2018. I will have no pension, I’m 10 years behind on retirement savings, and graduated college during the recession. I make okay, steady money, but I’m not a fucking millionaire (I make less than $100k per year). Even just the fact that he thinks I could somehow manage that is enraging to me and shows how out-of-touch with reality he is…

But, I’m going to offer advice:

* He already acquiesced that he has to cut his country club membership. He doesn’t play golf, he doesn’t play tennis, he literally was paying this club thousands of dollars per year to be able to hang out there and for nostalgia. FFS…
* He has to move, he says is lease is up in August. I’m going to tell him to look for places that are no more than 25 – 30% of his annual income…But I’m almost wondering if that should be even lower?
* I’m thinking I’m going to recommend he move out of NJ. It’s a really expensive state to live in, and while he grew up in NJ, he has no family left there. I was thinking of recommending states like North Carolina or Tennessee which I think are cheaper in both taxes and cost of living?
* I’m going to tell him to stop giving gratuities to people if he can’t afford to support himself.
* I’m going to tell him that he has to drastically reduce his food budget. He eats out every meal. His food budget is insane.
* He needs to stop buying clothes that need to be dry cleaned and start doing his own laundry.
* I think he should consider getting a part-time job – I know this will go over about as well as a lead balloon. He hasn’t worked at all since the early 90s, has never used a computer, and refuses to learn.  
   
 

**My questions:**

* Do pensions or social security “run out?” Does he need to worry that those sources of income will go away?
* What's a good target for housing per month? Is 25 - 30% of his income still okay in his situation or lower?
* Are pensions and social security taxed? If he lives in an apartment and doesn’t work, WTF is he paying federal and state taxes on?
* Is there a way to reduce any of his medical expenses? Does he actually need Medicare Part D and Gap coverage? He says the prescriptions he takes that can be generic already are, so I don’t know that there’s a way to reduce the cost of his prescriptions… He’s diabetic, obese, and has severe arthritis, those are the health issues I know about.
* Does he really need renter’s insurance, or is it a rip-off? 
* Any other advice I can give him? Any other resources that might be available for seniors for housing/help with finding a small job/budgeting?
* Am I right that something else happened here to drain his investment/IRA like that? He's saying it's just the annual expenses listed, plus a used car purchase a couple years back when his old car died and some dentistry work last year (totaling $3,000). Is there more to this story?   


**Backstory:** 

I (currently 32 years old) was just contacted by an estranged uncle (he’s now 70). I haven’t heard from him in 6 years. We didn’t see each other much when I was growing up, maybe once a year. We were close when I was in college and for a couple years after graduating, but he stopped speaking to me when I refused to take up financially supporting my mother after my father divorced her and got remarried (they’d lived separately since I was 5 but my dad had been paying her essentially non-court ordered alimony since they separated, the new wife – logically enough – said that had to stop). My mother’s a long story… She has a lot of mental health/substance abuse issues, and not only was I in a mountain of student loan debt but honestly, she was a fucking shitty mother, and I refused to threaten my financial security to enable her. My uncle’s view was that she was my family and I needed to make the payments to her that my father was stopping… He wanted me to give her about $14,000 a year, essentially for the rest of her life. Even if I’d wanted to, I wouldn’t have been able to make those payments.  


So, anyway… My uncle retired in 1991 when he was 42. He was a senior VP at an investment bank in NYC, and they offered him early retirement with a pension in lieu of a lay-off. Instead of getting another job, he took care of my elderly great aunt and grandmother until they passed away (great aunt passed in 1998, grandmother in 2001). He inherited a fair sum from both of them and lived off that rather than returning to work (no idea what the actual amount was…).   
 

He has no children and never got married. He was averse to owning property for some reason, and rented for the majority of his life. He did eventually buy a townhouse in NJ, but sold in 2014 and moved in to another apartment. He said he made about $160,000 from the sale of his townhouse, but that’s gone. He never travels.  


I’m not heartless, but the situation makes me really angry. Just that he could be asking me for this large amount of support and thinking that I’d actually have it to give, like there’s no comprehension how insane of an ask this is of anyone, let alone someone he hasn’t been willing to speak to for 6 years… But, that's all aside the point now, I guess.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway account… Need help with retired family member’s finances who is claiming they’re now destitute.

Unfortunately I've developed a bit of an unhealthy fear of spending money which I'm working on and am making progress on, but thats for /r/therapy, not here, lol

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Current picture:\*\* 28 Y/O, down to 50k student loans (35k at 5.45%, the rest at 3.5%). 15K E-fund + sinking funds for medical and car repairs. Takehome is 4k a month and my non-debt expenditures are usually around 2.5k. On average about 2k-2.5k a month goes to debt or savings, after averaging in my 3 paycheck months and the guaranteed portion of my yearly bonus (it's base + performance). My SO has loans similar to what I started with, but her income just doubled and she will be able to pay hers off within 10yrs. We aren't married yet, but thats something to consider.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Goals:\*\* Goal is to have student loans paid off in about 3 years (Conservative estimate). After that I'll max my 401k for 19k a year, and the goal is to retire in my early to mid 60s (63-65). I dont honestly have aspirations to retire lean or early, just to be able to hang up my tie and continue living the same QoL that I had while working. I do want to own a house (because a house means having a 2 car garage), so I'll start saving towards 100kish for downpayment + closing + home repair fund. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Heres the rub: I am, and have been since I could talk, a car guy. My only major splurge since starting my career was a fun daily (used Scion FR-S, paid cash of course), and I love it, prior to that I've always leaned towards fun no matter the budget (old integras/civics etc). I do AutoX with it, go to meets, etc, but it is a daily, and my only car, so I dont track it, mod it crazy, etc. I plan to drive it until god sees fit to take it from me. And even then he'll have to fight me for it. But the thing I love most about cars is building, restoring, and racing, experiences you cant really get with a daily (nevermind that a daily also needs to be safe, reliable, and practical, which a second car doesn't necessarily need)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After loans are paid off I'd like to spend 15k or so on a nice fun weekend car (cash of course). A convertible of some sort I can take to the LA canyons, cruise around with the SO in, track without worrying about crashing my commuter, keep nice and maybe tastefully modded, and drive until its damn near considered a classic. Probably a used vette (reliable but bit large, with a community filled with old men that dont drive them), or ideally a 987 boxter (yes, I know porsches are expensive to maintain, but I do most of my work myself. All my dream cars have been porsches, from the modern GT3s to the now unobtainable classic aircooled models that wont stop appreciating long enough for normal people to buy them). Once I have a home and a full garage of my own I'd also love to get a true classic to slowly restore on my own, probably a 240Z or maybe a 944T if neither have shot up in value by then.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Long story short: Am I a fucking idiot?\*\* Do I need to just get a couple models to stare at or videogames to play until after I have a house paid off and am on the cusp of retirement, or is this an ok dream to have? I have a hard time telling if I'm rationalizing a decision by thinking it will be ok, or just combatting my past attitude that spending any money at all is wrong. Basically I have 2 voices in my head and I don't have the perspective to decide which one is lying.

Well the first week that we received payment from Unum, she found another job and put in her two weeks.  She told them to cancel short term disability because she wouldn't need it anymore since she's leaving the company.  They confirmed it and said the paperwork was sent in. 

The week she started her new job we saw a new deposit in our account from Unum for one week's salary.  So my wife called up her old company and questioned it.  They told her the paperwork was sent in already and it should have stopped.  So she called Unum directly and they said it was an error on their part and they will withdraw it back.  

So we waited two weeks and nothing happened.  My wife who works in finance said they have two weeks to withdraw money from our account before the bank won't allow them to do it so since they went past that date, another arrangement needed to be made.  So she called Unum back and asked them why wasn't it taken out of our account.  They told her they have no record of it and no record of talking to her before on it and to them they see everything as perfect on their end.  

So we chalk it up as they will find it when they audit themselves and to keep that money in our savings account so we don't spend it.  

Well six weeks pass.  She's enjoying her new job.  Making $10k more per year and she loves the work.  I check our bank account and low and behold, another Unum payment for one weeks salary.  I tell my wife who flips out.  She works in finance and knows someone really screwed up here.  So she calls her old work and tells them.  They have no record of doing anything.  So she calls Unum and asks them what is going on.  Unum tells her that paperwork was sent in and approved for six weeks short term disability.  She tells them she hasn't worked at that company for over six weeks.  Unum said there's nothing they can do because her old company approved it.  She tells them to stop payments and to take the money back out.  

So we wait another two weeks and they never do it again.  The money is still in there.  So we move it to savings again so we don't spend it.

My question is.. will their audit system find this?  I mean they said my wife's old company approved the disability so Unum thinks these two payments are 100% valid.

Apparently, they had been continuing to charge me for data even though the original postpaid account should have been closed. Now I have a bill of $1200 that I have no idea how to pay. I have tried contacting them since I first got notification about the bill, but I have just been getting the run around ever since then. I got a letter in the mail that I'm on my final notice and that the account would be sent to collections fairly soon. They keep telling me that the charges are valid and that there is basically no way of reversing them, so I guess I'm going to have to figure out some way of paying it even though I never got any notice or bill that I was still being charged after I switched my account to prepaid.

I've been working on increasing my credit score as of late and have been doing fairly well, getting it to almost 700. And I've heard that collections can seriously ruin that and any decent chances at a good score. I'm 23 and will be graduating college in two more years, so I don't want something major that would affect my chances in the future. I stumbled upon LendingClub while browsing CreditKarma and was wondering if a personal loan is a good route to take instead of maxing out the pair of credit cards that I do have.

I'm 23, I bring in about $1000 a month. I have car payments at $230 (about $7000 remaining on the loan) and a phone bill at $60. I suppose I could also use the loan to pay off my remaining credit card debt &lt;$1500 too, but I'm not really sure what is a good route to take. I bank with Wells Fargo and Navy Fed (prior military) if either of those provides better loan options.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

US: Illinois - Chicago, near suburbs
37 y/o; soon-to-be-officially-single dad. Two elementary age kids, living with me half time.

income: 55k 
Savings: currently about 20k, I anticipate about 10k after divorce is final.
No debt at all once this house sells (car is paid off in one more payment, CC balances are paid in full every month)
If it matters, excellent (825+) credit.

This was the first home I've ever bought, so it's the first one I'll ever sell. Currently the difference between our sale price (after broker fees, lawyer fees, etc.) minus the remaining principal is about $120k. Divided in half (soon-to-be-ex-wife gets the other half), that's 60k. Do I walk away with all of that? Is there anything I'm missing? Is it taxed? If so, how do I estimate how much? Also if taxed, is it at time of sale or on my tax return after the end of this year?

Onto the rent budget question (with the above info in mind):

I've never been the most educated about budgeting, etc. I've always been fortunate enough to have a lifestyle-income ratio that made it so I didn't have to pay super close attention to budgeting.

Without having a clear sense of what my future budget was going to look like, I ballparked my rent budget until now (only went under contract on the home last week) at ideally 1500-1600, but willing to go to 1900, especially if some utilities, parking, or some other perk was included. Everything I'm finding in that range, though, is missing some of the things I want for my kids and me in our new home. On a personal values level, having a comfortable home for us is a big priority for me, but obviously I'm limited by my budget.

If my earlier assumptions are correct (I'm walking away with 60k take home, plus my already existing savings), can I afford to increase my rent budget to 2500/mo? I know this is WAY over the 1/3 of income rule of thumb but....

My figuring is this: One year at that increased rent will be an extra $7,000 (approx) paid in rent (over my previous top-of-budget). I still have over $50k of my profit on my house, and have had a year to figure out if that housing expense is sustainable with my new lifestyle post-divorce.

Would love to hear any thoughts/insights.

Also, I know that if I pay tax on that home sale, that changes things significantly.

Thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background info:

Also if taxed, is it at time of sale or on my tax return after the end of this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the rent budget question (with the above info in mind):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never been the most educated about budgeting, etc. I&amp;#39;ve always been fortunate enough to have a lifestyle-income ratio that made it so I didn&amp;#39;t have to pay super close attention to budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without having a clear sense of what my future budget was going to look like, I ballparked my rent budget until now (only went under contract on the home last week) at ideally 1500-1600, but willing to go to 1900, especially if some utilities, parking, or some other perk was included. Everything I&amp;#39;m finding in that range, though, is missing some of the things I want for my kids and me in our new home. On a personal values level, having a comfortable home for us is a big priority for me, but obviously I&amp;#39;m limited by my budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my earlier assumptions are correct (I&amp;#39;m walking away with 60k take home, plus my already existing savings), can I afford to increase my rent budget to 2500/mo? I know this is WAY over the 1/3 of income rule of thumb but....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My figuring is this: One year at that increased rent will be an extra $7,000 (approx) paid in rent (over my previous top-of-budget). I still have over $50k of my profit on my house, and have had a year to figure out if that housing expense is sustainable with my new lifestyle post-divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would love to hear any thoughts/insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I know that if I pay tax on that home sale, that changes things significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m young and I want to experience life. The last couple of weekends have been awesome weather wise and I can’t take sitting inside all weekend to save money.

I’m sure it’d be awesome to be old and retired with a huge lump sum to make me comfortable. I just fear looking back and regretting life because I had no experiences or adventures.

So is a truck and a boat plausible in my situation for next summer?

Income: 
After taxes, health insurance, and 6% to retirement, I take home $7,000/mo

Rent: $1,300/mo

Bills: $300 (Does not include car insurance as paid in full all the way to June 2020 already)

Food: $400/mo

Now debts...
Car: $9,600 with monthly payments of $306 at 1.84% interest. At that rate, I’m thinking about continuing minimum payments or kick it up $350.

Credit Card: $7,000. I’ve designated $3,000 each month to come out of my paycheck the next 2 months so this WILL be paid in full no later than October.

Student Loans: $120,000 at $1,400/mo. Currently in process of refinancing from 6.14% to 5.4%. I still feel like I can beat 5.4%.

This is where I know I am wrong. I have no emergency fund. I’m being cocky and arrogant in this regard in that I am very fortunate with parents that have $$$ and would easily give me if something were to happen. I do work in specialized field in healthcare that does not get laid off and am in demand. I suppose I could get fired for negligence, but I go into work with patient first aspect and am not that type of person that is a lazy worker.

Checking/Savings: $150. I’ve been throwing all my cash into debt. Feel like I’m better off getting rid of debt rather than putting money away in savings outside of retirement. Don’t know see how I can get a better return right now than the piece of mind of watching a 6%, $120k crater leave my name.

Fire away PF! I need brutal and honest truth. 

Also apologize for length and formatting. Doing this on mobile so not sure how it is going to look for everybody.

Thank you

Edit: Thank you to everyone for the brutal honesty. I needed to come back to my senses. I’ll continue to my dreaming.

Just for the record to clear my name, I swear I am not an impulse buyer anymore. It was years ago and have been repairing the damage. Trust me, that $7,000 credit card debt was much bigger before.

Am I going to be in danger because of this in any way? I'm annoyed because we didn't get to talk it over at all. My dad didn't even talk to my mom about it. He just suddenly did it out of nowhere. My mom is concerned they may somehow be able to take my savings or something. 

I've offered them money but they kept refusing and now here's the result. 😓 hoping this doesn't lead to more trouble.

The payoff on his mortgage was about $42k.  As part of the sale, I brought no cash to the table thanks to a gift of equity for my down payment plus seller assistance on closing costs. 

Basically, we set a sale price of $88k - $70k financed on my end, and the rest went to down payment.  I financed extra because of closing costs, and I wanted some extra money to do some necessary work, like new furnace, AC, and taking care of a rain water pooling at foundation problem. So when my stepdad got the check from the sale, he cashed it and then wrote one to me for the same amount, minus money for a furnace. 

My research on gift of equity and taxes has been pretty fruitful, so I think I’m set on that part. 

What I can’t find info on is the exchange of that income from the sale.  We would like to avoid him having to pay taxes on it since he never really made a profit off of the sale.  Is there any chance of managing that?

Could that portion be considered a gift?  

If so, follow up: The gift of equity is over the annual amount, but the check was below. Could the combined amount be considered a gift from my mom and stepdad below the $30k limit to avoid the form on their end?

I know when it comes to gifts, the tax burden is on the gifter. However, is there anything I should be prepared for on the receiving end?

Not sure if this is the right forum, but I have a feeling this miiight be some sort of a scam, but not sure.

Ok, background - my mother-in-law is a single, just turned 60 year old lady in a Baltic country (Eastern Europe). She has two grown-up children (including my wife) and a medium-sized house and shared garden with her son. Income is ok for sustaining herself, maybe little savings, but nothing significant.
She has been single for the past 10 years or so.

Now, the story develops over the past two weeks (we found out about it a week ago). Apparently there is this US Army officer/doctor (don’t have the exact details on all of this but please bear with me), who is on his last mission before going into retirement, he is 62.
So somehow he has found my MIL online (Facebook) and they are exchanging long messages and chats all day. His background is that he had a wife and kid from our country, who passed away in a car crash some years ago, so he is seeking for someone to ‘age beautifully’ with, but from the same country.

Apparently the messages are very passionate, he is already speaking of moving to our country after his mission ends and moving in together with her.
The latest info is that he’s asking her to go to Asia with him (they haven’t met yet). However, we stressed that they need to meet here first.
They are conversing in English and she is extremely happy that she has found someone. But all this seems very odd to me. 

Another weird point is that even though they started speaking on Facebook, he said that due to army rules he can’t use it a lot and asked to move the convo to ‘hangout’, which I think is a dating app.

All this seems very strange and a ‘dream come true’ for a 60 year old. However, I can’t really come up with a scam strategy...

My tax situation for TY2019 is expected to be one W2 and one 1099, both myself.  We are MFJ with 2 kids, lIving and working in MA (though the 1099 is from RI).

I found out recently that my employer matches dollar-for-dollar the first $2500 we put into dependant-care FSA.  Being as my wife is a SAHM, I never much payed attention to it...however we recently had our second and I have until EOB Friday to change my benefits and elect DC-FSA since we recently had our second child.

We are considering putting our first in preschool this fall.  Since she doesn't work, I know I'll have to pay taxes at the end of the year for money used out of DC-FSA...but with the matching funds, would it make sense anyway for me to start contributing?  The preschool is only about $200/mo, but every little bit helps, ya know?  This way I would pay $100 and get an extra $100 match.  I suppose I'd be paying taxes on $200/mo at tax time, but it seems that $100 of that would almost be a raise, of sorts.

Thoughts?

Side note, I don't see her going back to traditional work anytime soon, but if she has 1099 income &gt;= the FSA withdrawals by EOY, would that mean we wouldn't have to pay taxes on it, or does only W2 income apply?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

My goal is to aggressively attack my credit card debt while saving some money and enjoying a modest social life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a spreadsheet of my financial situation:  [https://imgur.com/a/adUB9NO](https://imgur.com/a/adUB9NO)

I am very concerned about my $500 monthly food and fun allotment and being able to stick to that but will try my hardest.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have to purchase a vehicle next week.  I have budgeted up to $300 per month for an auto loan and am willing to put up to $2000 down on the vehicle.  I am giving myself a firm $20,000 out the door price limit and ideally want that number closer to $15,000. I expect my APR to be between 4%-6% with my credit score of 708.

Assuming that I do put down the $2,000, then I have $4700 cash in my bank account.  I am considering putting all of that towards my Discover Card.

&amp;#x200B;

**Credit Debt Plan:** 

My debt plan is to avalanche my debt, starting with my Discover Card. After the car purchase I plan to transfer my Discover card balance to a 0% introductory rate card.  Given my experience with this in the past I don't believe I will be approved to transfer the full balance.  So whatever is left over I plan to pay off immediately.  Then do the same on the Capital One card in October, and again with the Citi Card in February 2020.  As long as those cards are at 0% I am comfortable paying the minimum monthly and putting money towards my next highest interest rate, which in this case would be the 6.5% from one of my student loans.  

*Is this a good plan?*

**Savings Plan:**

I have an HSA with my new employer where they contribute $3000 at the beginning of every calendar year without me having to contribute anything. I don't plan to contribute anything additional for the first year or two, even though I know there are tax incentives. I think that money is better off being spent on attacking my credit debt first.  I am in good health and don't have any recurring medical expenses.  

*Thoughts?*

I will be eligible to start on the 401K plan at the beginning of 2021.  The company contributes 10% of your base salary every year, without requiring you to contribute anything.  However I would like to be in a position by that time to contribute.  

I plan to squirrel away 10% of each paycheck into an account for emergencies and vacations and those types of things.

So I’ve been living in my apartment in Texas for about 7 months.  It’s a great community and I love it. But it’s expensive. I was able to afford it at the beginning of my lease, but some things have come up that have left me scrambling to pay my rent the past couple of months. Last month, I was five days late on rent, so there’s the late fees for that, which I haven’t paid because I’m unable to, and now I’m late on this month’s rent which I don’t even have enough for the base amount due, let alone the fees. Nobody has contacted me about eviction in any way whatsoever, but I’m just waiting for it to come any day now. I don’t know the laws or process when it comes to how eviction works, I’ve never had to deal with it because I’ve always been pretty good about paying everything on time. But this year has been different. I’ve had to sell some of my stuff to make rent and I did not like that. But that’s beside the point. I know that I have the option to terminate my lease at any time without any repercussions. It won’t go on my credit report and won’t affect me in the future when I try to rent/buy. But I will have to give a 60 day notice and also pay ~$2200 within 3 days of moving out. The thing is, I don’t know if I’d be able to pay that amount within that time frame. Maybe most of it, but definitely not all of it. 

I don’t know what to do about this, any advice would be appreciated.

I'm worried for all sorts of reasons, but my mane concern is:

1) Will we both be able to keep paying rent here?

2) Will my ex-partner over extend themselves and put themselves in a financial position they cannot recover from?

3) Will we both end up homeless?

4) How in god's name can I get rid of this god forsaken car?

My husband and H both are using GI bills that we've budgeted to pay for our housing year round.
We were originally planning on renting an apartment, but the more we discuss moving there, the more we want to stay there after school. We both have job security there as well for when we graduate. I graduate in 1.5 years, my husband and H graduate in 4 more years (both dual majoring). My husband doesn't want to move inbetween semesters, so once we move we will be living in that place for at least 4 years.

The more I think about renting, the more I dislike it. I don't like the idea of putting money towards rent and never owning, when we could buy a new construction property in the area for the same cost. I understand renting is more 'secure' if something major happened to the place, but I'd really like to own, have equity, and do what I wish to my home.

Husband and I discuss this often as we plan to move early 2020, and his biggest worry is the unfairness for H. He feels like H is getting the worst deal because he's helping us pay for mortgage without owning any of the property. Husband and I also couldn't come up with an agreement on how we would set up rent, I said maybe 45/55 depending on bedroom sizes, husband says 30/70 because H will have no equity, but that sounds crazy! We have not brought this up to H yet, as too much is in the air. Even though, H is really chill about everything else housing wise we've talked about and didn't care if we split an apartment 50/50, including utilities, though we would get the master. We've even discussed a 3rd bedroom being the work room for my husband and H, and any extra storage/garage for H (if we buy, the house would have at least 2 garage spots though). 

If it matters: our budget is $1,400 when looking at apartments, split 50/50 with roommate. But for mortgages, we've been pre-approved for mortgages no more than $12-1300/month with insurance and taxes included in the monthly mortgage.

We are curious, what would be a good price to charge for rent in this scenario? Would it be bad of us to discuss buying/building a home instead of getting an apartment like we first discussed to H? Is that even any of his business?

Was never able to save til now, just started a great job a few months ago.

Income: $3,300 Month, this is net income

Car Debt: $16,000. This is over the next 5 years. Was a six year loan for $19,000, very low interest sub 3.

Credit Card Debt: $2,000. This is on a zero interest credit card, at least for now. I want to attack this first just to get rid of the balance.

Total Debt: $18,000 (no student loans)

Savings: Just a few hundred

Retirement: Nothing, but just opened a Roth IRA. Job does not offer a 401K.

Credit Score: 790, if this is needed at all.

Trying to save for a House in a couple years and also trying to get all debt paid off. Houses in this area are about $330k, so want to put 5% down. That's around 10K each saved for my fiancee and I in the next two years.

&amp;#x200B;

Expenses:

Rent $580.00 (split house rent with fiancee)

Car Payment $275.00

Car Insurance $130

Power $85.00

Water $60.00

Cell Phone $50.00

Haircut $30.00

Gas $15.00

Car Gas $225.00 (commute)

Internet $25

Youtube Red $10

Credit Card $250 (in order to get paid off before interest hits)

Dog Expenses $70.00 (No kid expenses yet thankfully lol)

Gym $20.00

Roth IRA $100.00  (Will raise this to $500.00 once have enough saved for House Down Payment and Car Paid Off)

Emergency Savings $175.00

Travel $150.00

Food $300.00

Take Out $100.00

House Down Payment Savings $400.00

Extra Car Payment $300.00

Total

&amp;#x200B;

$3,350.00

&amp;#x200B;

This obviously leaves me with no spending money which isn't realistic. Should I not pay extra on my car until the Credit Card Debt is paid off? Which will be just 6-7 months. Then I would have $250-300 of spending money to work around with

I am 27 years old and currently live in the US. Originally I'm from Europe, so that's also where most of my savings are. 

I have around 85,000$ (75,000€) in my savings in my European bank account. I have around 30,000$ here in my bank and am currently too afraid to do something with it. I'm working as a freelancer and since I moved not too long ago I am not too sure on how the situation will be so I'd rather use my 30k as an emergency fund. I do not have any debt and a good credit score.

I am super risk averse and if I could, I would stack my money under my bed so I can see it all the time (not literally, but that's how I feel about the situation).

I realized that it might be smart to invest at least a part of my money in Europe, which is currently just sitting around in my bank account with a very low return rate (0.1% as far as I know).

I love this subreddit and tried to find something right for me in the guidelines, but every person has a different story and without enough knowledge I'm even more afraid to invest my money into something I am not sure of. 

I recently had a talk with my bank guy and he told me to invest 20k in something with almost no return - I think the maximum is a 1.5% but without any risk. I did say yes to that - now in retrospect I am not sure if that was a smart idea. The money can always be taken out but depending on the market I might lose a bit. 

I currently do not have a retirement plan (I graduated from university two years ago, then moved and had many other costs coming up - hence no retirement plan atm). 

Any advice on how to handle my situation would be highly appreciated.

I’m a manager but this project is on top of my regular responsibilities. I’m learning a ton and have been putting in very long hours because this project is much more in line with the direction I’d like my career to go.

At a meeting about 2-3 weeks ago my boss remarked that I’ve been putting in extra time and there could be some extra compensation for me, hourly or a lump sum if I wanted it. I asked to think about it. 

A few weeks passed and I deliberated for a while on what to ask for. I have to admit, I probably put in more extra time than I might have had the bonus never been mentioned. Last Sunday I decided to email my boss again asking if I could still get the bonus and go by my salary translated to an hourly rate, which seemed like the fairest thing to do. 

He didn’t respond right away but asked me to stay after a meeting yesterday and said that would be fine, I can just email him the number of hours and he’d add to my paycheck. But then he said that while some managers just put in their 8 hours a day, others put in much more and the ones who rise through the company the fastest are the ones who work more. 

It was said in a completely off hand way, not threatening or anything but now I’m torn and frustrated. The few people I’ve told all say I am undervaluing myself and I should go for the bonus. But I can’t help but feel like doing so is going to reflect badly on me and cost me career advancement. And I guess I feel frustrated because I put in some extra time with less hesitation because a bonus was mentioned but now I feel like I should not take it.

All in all I just feel upset and like I wish it was never brought up in the first place. So, what do you think — request the bonus, or just let it go?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m working on a big project at work that will continue through the rest of the year, though the biggest time crunch is right now. I’m a manager but this project is on top of my regular responsibilities. I’m learning a ton and have been putting in very long hours because this project is much more in line with the direction I’d like my career to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a meeting about 2-3 weeks ago my boss remarked that I’ve been putting in extra time and there could be some extra compensation for me, hourly or a lump sum if I wanted it. I asked to think about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks passed and I deliberated for a while on what to ask for. I have to admit, I probably put in more extra time than I might have had the bonus never been mentioned. Last Sunday I decided to email my boss again asking if I could still get the bonus and go by my salary translated to an hourly rate, which seemed like the fairest thing to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t respond right away but asked me to stay after a meeting yesterday and said that would be fine, I can just email him the number of hours and he’d add to my paycheck. But then he said that while some managers just put in their 8 hours a day, others put in much more and the ones who rise through the company the fastest are the ones who work more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was said in a completely off hand way, not threatening or anything but now I’m torn and frustrated. The few people I’ve told all say I am undervaluing myself and I should go for the bonus. But I can’t help but feel like doing so is going to reflect badly on me and cost me career advancement. And I guess I feel frustrated because I put in some extra time with less hesitation because a bonus was mentioned but now I feel like I should not take it. Also my annual review is before the end of the year so I don’t want to jeopardize anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all I just feel upset and like I wish it was never brought up in the first place. So, what do you think — request the bonus, or just let it go?&lt;/p&gt;

So I bring home $1172 a week (salaried) working for my fathers business.

I have 4 credit cards, all are at a $0 balance as of right now. I’ve offered to pay rent but my parents tell me to save up for my own house, I feel bad so I end up buying some stuff for the house like water, toilet paper, etc. I pay for Apple Music ($10 a month), Crunchyroll ($6.95 a month), iCloud storage ($1 a month) and just cancelled a few other things so I’m currently at around $18 a month for subscriptions.

The truck is a 2017 F250 Super Duty. I think it’s a really pretty truck and I’ve wanted one of the newer body styles since they came out.

I still could do that, but who knows what financial situation I’ll be in 3 years from now. Not saying my job status is likely to change negatively any time soon but who knows, anything can happen in 3 years.

So my question is, what do more financially responsible and overall wiser redditors think I should do?

I've been looking into refinancing and despite the overwhelming amount of advice couldn't figure it all out on my own so decided to ask the experts.

Basic details:

* I'm 25 years old and **just** finished my Master's in Athletic Training
* My **monthly income** after taxes is **$3200**, this is my **first month** on my **new job @ a Public University**
* Currently the I have an **extra $1000** coming in from a different teaching position
* I plan to **pay $1200 monthly** **towards** my **loans**
* I have an excellent **credit score \~760**
* My **mom** **cosigned** the **loans**
* My **income** will **not change** for the next **2 years**

All my **private loans** are through **Discover for $63,340**. Details about my private loans:

* One **account balance is $52,640** and has these consolidated loans that have **payment deferred until May 2020**:
   * **$22,000** @ interest rate of **5.490% fixed** , deferred interest balance of $560
   * **$14,000** @ interest rate of **5.240% variable**, deferred interest balance of $197
   * **$16,640** @ interest rate of **5.115% variable**, deferred interest balance of $385
* Second account amount balance is **$10,700** @ interest rate of **4.740%** **variable**, minimum payment due of $25, deferred interest balance of $63, principal $292, interest $757

**Federal loan** is **$20,000** @ interest rate of **3.4%**, it's been deferred till July 2020.

**Questions:**

* Is variable interest rate bad currently/in my situation?
* Should I look into refinancing my private loans now though my major private loan is deferred currently?
* From this sub it seems like I should keep the federal loan and think of income based repayment (IBR) is that accurate?
* How should I go about paying these off? I've heard about the strategy where you pay off the highest interest loan first after minimum payment on all, but most of my loans are deferred, am I better of starting to pay them now?
* Since my annual income is &gt;70k, I've read that student loan interest can be deducted up to $2,500, is this helpful to me in anyway?

Any/all advice would be appreciated. Thank you for helping a newbie out in advance!

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$22,000&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;5.490% fixed&lt;/strong&gt; , deferred interest balance of $560&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$14,000&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;5.240% variable&lt;/strong&gt;, deferred interest balance of $197&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$16,640&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;5.115% variable&lt;/strong&gt;, deferred interest balance of $385&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second account amount balance is &lt;strong&gt;$10,700&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;4.740%&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;variable&lt;/strong&gt;, minimum payment due of $25, deferred interest balance of $63, principal $292, interest $757&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federal loan&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;$20,000&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;3.4%&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;#39;s been deferred till July 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is variable interest rate bad currently/in my situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I look into refinancing my private loans now though my major private loan is deferred currently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From this sub it seems like I should keep the federal loan and think of income based repayment (IBR) is that accurate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should I go about paying these off? I&amp;#39;ve heard about the strategy where you pay off the highest interest loan first after minimum payment on all, but most of my loans are deferred, am I better of starting to pay them now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since my annual income is &amp;gt;70k, I&amp;#39;ve read that student loan interest can be deducted up to $2,500, is this helpful to me in anyway?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any/all advice would be appreciated. Thank you for helping a newbie out in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

Just joined and it looks like there are those with some valuable advice out there that could be very useful. 

I currently work for a large Aerospace company as a Project Manager and make $80k-$90k a year supporting a family of 4 in one of the highest housing markets in the country, so that salary isn’t going as far it it would in the cheaper states in the country. I’d like my wife to stay home with the kids because of all the benefits that go along with her doing that, so I’d like to have an income that will help provide the best I can for my family. 

I’m 27 years old with about 8 years of experience in Manufacturing, 5 in aerospace and a few in Management before I joined my current employer. 

I am interested in getting my BS in Computer Science or Software Development (That my current employer will pay for). I have a Masters degree in Leadership from a state college and a BS in business. I chose those majors because I hate math and know the two degrees I’m considering are going to have me get into Calc and all that not so fun stuff. 

The questions are:

Do you think that struggling for 2-3 years with the math will pay off as far as employment offers are concerned? I’d like to get an offer for more than I’m currently making so that I won’t skip a beat with my financial goals. 

Would staying in my current role and getting various certifications over the course of the next few years be better if it would get me to the $100k-$110k range? (Probably not making more than $120k-$130k over the next 10-15 years, that seems like the cap for my program)

**Making an emergency account**  
I see that making a tiered emergency account is advised as per [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/22s5iz/where_should_i_keep_our_6month_emergency_fund/cgptw4u/). My first question is why is it advised to split your emergency fund like that? Your emergency fund is for emergencies, so wouldn't you want it all in one place for quick and easy access in the case of an emergency? Is it because Roth offers more interest, followed by savings, followed by checking, but withdrawing money from those accounts also has a higher cost descending in that order? So tiering it offers the most money gain in the end assuming that you’ll never encounter an emergency where you’re required to dip into your Roth? Also, when an emergency occurs, how should you go about using the money if it's tiered? Clear your checking, then move to savings, then move to your retirement fund (that's what a Roth IRA is, right?)? Finally, in the comment he talks about I-bonds and VSCGX, which look like investments to me if I’m understanding this correctly. But on the wiki page, it says you shouldn’t invest your emergency funds, so either I don’t understand what I-bonds and VSCGX are (if that’s the case, please help me understand) or there are conflicting views on whether or not you should invest your emergency funds, in which case it comes down to preference?  
    
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Making a savings account**  
A retirement account is a form of a savings account, correct? Am I supposed to have a savings account (like at the local bank) as well as a retirement account? Would the only purpose of it be to hold emergency funds of about 50% of it if I tier my emergency funds? In that case, the most important factor in choosing a savings account would be accessibility, since you likely won’t have a balance big enough for the small interest difference between banks to matter much?  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Making a retirement account**  
Due to the overseas earned income exclusion, it looks like I’m not eligible to open an IRA, Roth, or 401k. I do however, get pension upon leaving the country, the first of which I used to take down my student loan. To clarify, I move countries/employers every few years. What are my options for building a retirement fund? Should I just stick to a typical savings account? Investopedia says brokerage accounts are one alternative. However, it also says that firms that offer guidance and counseling (which I will probably need since I’m so lost in the economic world) usually have a hefty fee. Should I just invest (I-bonds and CDs?) the money that I would have otherwise put into a retirement account? 
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Investing**  
For I-bonds, I basically give them money, they hold it for a maximum of 30 years, and then they give me my money back plus interest? It’s that simple? I see that you can buy a maximum of $10k I-bonds per year. If I spend $10k over 2 years, do I have 2 I-bonds worth $10k, or one I-bond worth $20k? Is it advisable to buy I-bonds every year in this fashion? Is I-bond a company product or its own entity? As in, do different companies offer different I-bond rates, or is I-bond its own thing and every I-bond will be treated equally?  
For CDs, does every big bank offer them? If so, I’m assuming each bank has different rates, correct? And to make sure I understand the concept correctly, the basic principal is like this:  
- If I invest $5, they give me $1 each month.  
- I invest $25 ($5x5). This nets me $5.  
- I add the new $5 to my original investment (now $30).  
- This nets me $6 the next month.  
And this continues for as long as you’d like. Adding your earnings to your base investment to further increase your earnings is where the “ladder” comes from, correct?  
For now, I’m only interested in safe long-term investments as I want to get all my chicks in a row before trying to learn aggressive investing. Is this a good way to go about it? Or should I start trying to learn how to do that as soon as possible?

Thank you so much to anyone who has read this far.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty much debt free (I&amp;#39;ve gotten down to less than $1,000 left in student loans and have 5 years to pay it off) and so I&amp;#39;m looking to start preparing money for retirement. After reading the wiki, my understanding is I should use my money in this order:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an emergency account&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a savings account&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a retirement account&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have absolutely no background on finance, so all of the terms and different types of accounts and things confuses me a lot. I have questions about each of these areas and hoping someone will be kind enough to help me understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making an emergency account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

So now, obviously, I'm back again to ask for more advice.

My down payment plus closing costs is going to be $130,700, and there's ""a month of rent back, which can probably be applied toward closing costs"" (agent's words), but I don't fully understand that and ""probably"" didn't really convince me, so I'm just going to pretend that money doesn't exist.  I currently have $132,000 in my checking account; we lived on $20,000 annual income from 2007 to 2015 then my income shot up to $100,000 and we didn't change our lifestyle, so we went from scraping by to a robust savings account pretty fast, and I'm pretty sure I can replace the savings by this time next year.

So here's the retirement fund situation: In 2007 I came into some money ($4,000) and early 2008 put it into a Roth IRA and bought Starbucks at $9/share, and I think I've made a couple contributions since then but I forget when or how much.  I would like to use the house as an excuse to pull as much out of retirement as possible to give myself some wiggle room (This is only about 6 months worth of expenses, but I'm not expecting my work situation to change, if it does I'll just go live homeless at the docks or under a bridge or something... LA has a lot of beautiful bridges).

So far I've spoken to my home loan agent, my next door neighbor (CPA), and my dad (landlord since about 1960), and all 3 of them seem to be disagreeing on whether or not my Roth IRA can be used toward my down payment on my house, and none of them seem to know what the actual steps are to getting it done.

My Roth IRA is currently in etrade, I am not sure exactly how much I've contributed and I haven't been able to find the breakdown on their website. I *think* my total cash contributions over the years were $8,000 and my profit on investments is $20,000.  From what I've read online, I should be able to take out $18,000 without penalty ($10,000 of the profit along with the $8,000 original contribution).  However, all 3 of the people I've spoken to tell me that I'm wrong; one of them tells me I can take out all $28,000 no problem, and one of them says it's a hard $10,000 limit.  Additionally, I can't figure out how to tell for sure the exact amount of my initial contribution and I'm worried that if it's, say, $6,000 instead of $8,000 like I remember, that I'll get hit with a bunch of penalties.

So that brings me into the ""steps"" for getting the cash out, and how exactly the penalty works for running over the limit (if there IS a limit, which the home loan agent insists there is not).  Is the penalty a flat fee or a percent?  What's the percent?  Do I just take the money out and then deal with it on my taxes or do I have to notify etrade ahead of time, and if so how does that process work?

I am currently looking to replace my wife’s car. It’s an older ‘06 American made vehicle, and rust has gotten the better of it. We’re looking to buy a 2-3 year old Honda or Subaru, and I plan on this being our only car loan until it’s paid off.

We’re currently shopping for the best deal on True Car, and hopefully find a vehicle nearby. We have another car loan for my vehicle with about $1500 left on it, but we may not be able to wait until it’s paid off to purchase her a replacement. I have a few questions that I need to consider, and any advice/ reasoning would be greatly appreciated!

1) Should I pay off my loan first so the banks see I have less owed or does this not make a difference? We have the money, but would prefer to make the next several payments rather than pay it off immediately if it has no impact on the next purchase.

2) Should I get prequalified for a loan first at a credit union, or do this at the car dealership?

3) Any experience with True Car? They seem like a good source of info. I’ve also been looking into Carvana. Some people seem to love it, others have had bad experiences. Either way I just want to get the best deal. 

4) What are the perks to buying at a local dealership as opposed to one further away? I don’t mind traveling 50-100 miles to get the right deal if it’s a one time thing. 

5) Should I put my wife and myself both on the loan? I have excellent credit (Credit Karma estimates 780-800) and 7+ years of history. My income ranges 55,000 - 65,000. My wife doesn’t work currently, and her credit is estimated between 700-730 on credit karma. I’d like to help her build more credit in case anything ever happens to me.

&lt;p&gt;1300 credit limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;800 is spent on an item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;500 credit limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wife pays the monthly bill but somehow puts in 1500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chase credit shows 1300 credit limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;200 somehow missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Called chase and they supposedly return the excess amount of it exceeds the credit balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chase rep said they will refund the 1500 payment, which would put the Credit Card 200 in the negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heres the problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That 800 dollar item is going to be refunded soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Chase just refuse the refund and send it back? Will I have an overflow of 800 in my Credit Card?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I just lose 800?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

For the past 6 years I’ve worked seasonal seafood jobs to supplement my income. I love the work, but it doesn’t pay enough to live off of so I live with my mom during my time off (about 3 months). I usually pick up a serving job or something. 

She’s not expected to live much longer. She owns a crappy car and a house that is valued around $200,000. If sold, the money would be split with my uncle who is our only other living relative. No life insurance policy and under $1000 in her bank account. Also has 5 cats that I don’t think I’ll be able to take care of.

I currently don’t pay rent. I pay for utilities and such, but have never had to budget for the real world. I don’t own a car. I don’t have insurance. I have maybe $700 to my name at the moment. 

Sorry if this post is all over or in the wrong place. I’m not sure what to do with the kind of money I would receive from selling the house and I don’t know what to budget for when people die? Loose ends, etc. I think I’m just super overwhelmed right now.

***Edit/Update:

Thank you all so much for genuinely good information and being so kind.  I’m for sure going to look into trade schools. To answer some questions: I have my GED, and no debt at all (which is nice.) My mother has aggressive stomach cancer and she lives in Florida. Home is entirely under her name legally and she wants to do the right thing by giving my uncle what he was entitled to when my grandparents passed.

As to how I have no savings: I’ve been doing work travel programs for years and it’s never allowed me to save money or have my own shit. I’m actually currently in Alaska working at a fish processing plant. Health issues have kept me out of the military and also from hopping on a fishing boat unfortunately.

Also am a v single lady with no significant other or siblings and few friends who also lead the same work/travel/repeat lifestyle.  I’ve done mostly factory and fish work for a while, but I’ve worked all over the US at summer camps, farms, hostels and national parks. Some jobs pay well, but most pay trash and offer room and board instead.

I want to be honest with you guys, I have no goals or dreams besides live and be not miserable? I fucked off for so long and kind of just stopped thinking about the long term because it hurt my small peanut brain. It’s always just been my mom and I doing our own shit and then hanging out for a couple months before I leave again and it’s been so awesome, but it’s definitely catching up to me now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information: &lt;/p&gt;

I have never made a budget before. I came close a few times, but I have some mental blocks regarding it. I have a rough idea of what I spend. I make ~$3600 a month(70k/yr), paid every other week. I spend $740/mo on rent and between $40-80/mo on my phone plan.

I have nearly $17,000, broken up across different accounts (skip to after the dot if you don't care how it's broken up)

$4500 in an investments account, half of that actually invested. The rest I pulled from BYND when it was double what I invested. 

$3000 in a savings account I'd like to keep for emergencies.

$5000 in a checking account doing nothing, but I'll be paying my rent by check so I'll always need $2500 at the start of each month, before my roommates reimburse me. (I'm working on this, I'll try to get paid before the rent is due).

20M still learning, i just want to be successful. Today I decided I will open up a emergency fund. I took $500 and wanted to take 45% of the 500 which is $225. I split it and rounded it to $112.

I figured I'd put my emergency fund in a savings account because I want it to grow with high interest. I understand how the saving account works and how long it will take to transfer into my account (3 days) and 6 transfers a month. It was either put the emergency fund in a checkings and not grow or putting my money in my savings account to where my emergency fund can grow in the savings through interest.

My goal every paycheck is to put 45% of my income into my savings and emergency fund. The other 55% can stay into my account this is what I'll use for regular purchases. Buying groceries, buying clothing, toilet tree, insurance, rent (I'll be in the Air Force soon so the military will pay for most of my needs) Joining the Air Force will make it easier to save money, with this I want save to invest into real Estate.

&lt;p&gt;I figured I&amp;#39;d put my emergency fund in a savings account because I want it to grow with high interest. I understand how the saving account works and how long it will take to transfer into my account (3 days) and 6 transfers a month. It was either put the emergency fund in a checkings and not grow or putting my money in my savings account to where my emergency fund can grow in the savings through interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal every paycheck is to put 45% of my income into my savings and emergency fund. The other 55% can stay into my account this is what I&amp;#39;ll use for regular purchases. Buying groceries, buying clothing, toilet tree, insurance, rent (I&amp;#39;ll be in the Air Force soon so the military will pay for most of my needs) Joining the Air Force will make it easier to save money, with this I want save to invest into real Estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a going in the right direction? What are some things I can do while on my journey? I&amp;#39;m young and dumb and still learning.&lt;/p&gt;

No dependents and plan on staying that way. Old throwaway because my primary account is probably identifiable by some friends or family that might see this.


I've lurked here and r/financialindependence plenty, but generally feel out of my depth and uninterested in the ""active management"" approach. The lazier the better, as in everything.


Having changed careers (less than $30k/yr) into something that pays quite a bit more (now at $80k/yr) a couple of years ago and not feeling like I have as much to show for it financially as I should, I've been pondering paying a financial advisor for some help. I'm worried that if I pay someone $1500 right now, I'm just going to end up with a budget that I could have created on my own and $1500 less towards savings or investments.


I have 2 distinct short-er term goals:

* within 2 years, buy and outfit a van for living/adventuring. I realize that my living situation could change due to SO situation or whatnot in the meantime, but I like to go camping and hiking and adventuring a lot and this would enable that further, making me happier (the most important part!). And if that situation doesn't ariae, I have a much cheaper housing situation that would prepare me for the next part. I want to do this right, and expect the whole thing to cost in the neighborhood of $60k all said and done.

* partial retirement by 40. Looking to only need to pick up contracting or consulting work a couple days a week, and would expect an absolute minimum of $50/hr. I want to bump around the country going to national parks and exploring, then come back to WiFi or whatever and make enough to subsist that lifestyle on while whatever investments I have continue to grow. Timeframe would be somewhat flexible but I'm not working full time past 45 without being drug kicking and screaming.


Long term goal of continuing that lifestyle, willing to keep piddling with contracting or whatnot for a while, hard to particularly say now since that's so far in the future.


I have some assets and debt, but nothing spectacular.


Assets

* A little over $10k in high yield savings (ally), a couple thousand in my bank's lower yield (summer is expensive, I've been reluctant to move it all over and have to wait if I decide to do something. In winter my spending goes way down and it will all go to ally)

* a 401k that I'm not great at tracking the value of but is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $3k (I didn't enroll myself for too long, dumb move)

* $500 in wealthfront. Just getting started here.

* HSA with a couple thousand in it. 


Debt

* $5k left on a car loan, paying $270/mo right now

* $1300 in student loans. Making $350/mo payments so that's gone in a couple months, then divert most or all of that to the car

* Both of these are paying almost entirely principal, I'm accruing less than 2% interest total even if I don't shift the payments


My monthly bills (rent, insurance, phone, streaming services, etc) come out to about $1900/mo, and my take home is right at $5000/mo. I put $700/Mo in savings automatically, and try to put another ~$500 in each month.


I don't really feel like I need a financial advisor, since most of the cases I see if that are people that are in some horrible debt or tax situation and Im (thankfully, for the first time in my life) not. But I think the peace of mind of having it all figured out for me might be worth it. That said if it's just going to be a budget and pump more money into savings accounts and investments I don't want to waste my money. Though, also due to my huge pay increase I feel like I've let some lifestyle creep get me and now I'm not sure what kind of budget is reasonable, especially because I don't really ""have"" to. I can just go out and eat if I want, I have plenty of money. That's proving to be problematic for an aggressive savings plan.


Any recommendations, based on my story? Assuming they're well regarded and certified and not crazy expensive for my area, is a financial advisor...advisable?

We live in Ontario Canada. I have a pretty good job that pays \*well\* nothing that is 6 figures or anything though and she has a pretty okay job, doesn't pay more than 35k. 

My go to solution has simply been to work overtime because I want to try to get more stuff done on the house. She does price matching for groceries. We don't do anything extremely lavish but will have a couple dates out a month and the odd meal out, but it is budgeted for.

All said and done by budget we should be saving around $400 a month after everything is accounted for before any extra hours are accounted for. So I have worked extra to try to get us ahead. I thought about RRSPs but I initially took out money for our first home so I am in the process of paying that back every year so there isn't much break to put money back in there right now at tax time.

The car should be paid off in 1-2 months time opening up another $237 approx left over.

I am probably in a more enviable position then most but I get frustrated that I haven't been able to make as much progress on our new house as I would like.

I usually work 4 days and have 2 off but I either add hours to my days if they ask me to stay behind or I am working 1-2 days of my time off in order to make up funds. Sometimes I hit a bit of a wall and I am burned out and need to actually take the 2 days. It is a good job and I like it, not physically demanding or anything.

&lt;p&gt;We live in Ontario Canada. I have a pretty good job that pays *well* nothing that is 6 figures or anything though and she has a pretty okay job, doesn&amp;#39;t pay more than 35k. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My go to solution has simply been to work overtime because I want to try to get more stuff done on the house. She does price matching for groceries. We don&amp;#39;t do anything extremely lavish but will have a couple dates out a month and the odd meal out, but it is budgeted for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All said and done by budget we should be saving around $400 a month after everything is accounted for before any extra hours are accounted for. So I have worked extra to try to get us ahead. I thought about RRSPs but I initially took out money for our first home so I am in the process of paying that back every year so there isn&amp;#39;t much break to put money back in there right now at tax time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car should be paid off in 1-2 months time opening up another $237 approx left over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am probably in a more enviable position then most but I get frustrated that I haven&amp;#39;t been able to make as much progress on our new house as I would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually work 4 days and have 2 off but I either add hours to my days if they ask me to stay behind or I am working 1-2 days of my time off in order to make up funds. Sometimes I hit a bit of a wall and I am burned out and need to actually take the 2 days. It is a good job and I like it, not physically demanding or anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I do? Is there even anything or just keep my sleeves rolled up and work hard? Other then that, start buying lotto tickets and hope the numbers go my way?&lt;/p&gt;

We are currently registered as domestic partners, and I'm questioning whether marriage would be financially beneficial for us.

Basically I'm trying to create and Excel sheet that compares what our total take home pay will be in three scenarios: unmarried, married filing separate, or married filing jointly. Every time I search for an answer regarding one factor, I learn about something else I hadn't considered or didn't know about.

So, the factors I need to account for that I have identified are:

* If we are unmarried he can claim head of household
* If we are married filing joint taxes, my student loan payment will skyrocket
* If we are married filing separate my student loan payment will not change, but I won't be able to claim the interest deduction on my taxes
* If he claims head of household, he will be claiming the baby on his taxes. Does this mean he can also claim the child tax credit? How does this work? 
* If I claim the baby, my ""discretionary income"" will go down, so my student loan payment will go down (I think this is negligible compared to the benefits of him claiming head of household). 

&amp;#x200B;

What factors am I missing that will affect our take home pay? So far, it looks to me like the best option is to not get married, and have him claim the baby. However, I don't want to start crunching the numbers again until I know for sure I'm accounting for all the factors and haven't overlooked something. So far I have also not found a single beneficial thing that marriage will accomplish that can't also be accomplished another way without marriage. I know, I sound really romantic right now... Are there any other reasons that marriage might be a better option for us?

Background Info: 

Before taxes and deductions, he makes $80,000 annually, I make $61,000. I intend to stay full time at my job and just take my parental leave before returning to work. I don't expect either of us to have a loss in income. I have a large student loan debt, and am currently on the income based repayment plan (I pay 10% of my discretionary income towards loans annually). I qualify for public service loan forgiveness. We both have decent health insurance, but with our company's HSA contributions it is cheaper (even if we hit the maximum out of pocket) to each use our own insurance, not have both of us on one person's insurance. That means as long as we keep the same jobs, Imputed Income is not an issue if we don't get married (we've gone through this before with him on my insurance). It will be cheaper if the baby goes on my insurance. I also have a major medical condition that causes me to usually hit my maximum out of pocket, so I always make sure I contribute enough to have that amount in my HSA account. Having a dependent (baby) on my insurance would mean my company would double their HSA contribution, meaning I wouldn't have to contribute any more to my HSA than I already am to still have enough to cover the higher maximum out of pocket with a dependent. 

He owns the townhouse we live in. The plan would be to put me on the deed prior to baby being born. I don't know if this is a factor or not, but my understanding is that if he claims head of household he must pay majority of the household bills. 

Final question: If the baby is born in October, does that mean he can't claim head of household that year because he hasn't had a child for at least 6 months?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I have started talking about trying to get pregnant at the start of 2020.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m new to my job so I don&amp;#39;t get to contribute to 401K yet, but i&amp;#39;m planning to once it opens up to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I have leftover savings and I was wondering which account I should invest them in for index funds. (I have 3 months of emergency fund in my savings account at the moment as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I start general individual account or Traditional IRA?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, what would be my next step after investing it all in index fund? just save up and keep reinvesting back in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;

I recently took a job opportunity in Philadelphia for a 40% pay increase raising me and my wife's average combined income to 100k/yr. My home is in the suburbs 2 hours away and for the last 2 months I have been commuting 2 hours to work, working 8 hours, then commuting 2 hours home. It's starting to wear me down and I am trying to determine if it would make more financial sense to rent a room in the city during the work week? Job opportunities closer to where we live are far and few between and relocating is not an option. Weighing all opportunity costs,  I am also not keen on job hopping anytime soon as my industry/company in particular will be the fastest way to reach a 6 figure income and clean up all of our debt. 

Net Income: $5,700-6,000/mo

Expenses: \~$4,200/mo

Total Debt:

180k mortgage

50k student loans

10k car note

5k credit card debt

Budget:

$1500 mortgage

$204 train ticket

$500 gas

$200 utilities 

$200 student loans

$236 car payment

$162 car insurance

$300 credit card payments

$300 food

$400 misc.

$150 pets

$100 health insurance

&amp;#x200B;

I commute 100 miles a day, 4-5 days a week spending \~$60-90/week on gas, averages around to $300/mo for my car alone.

Then $205/mo for a train ticket into the city from the station. So my total commuting cost is $505/mo not counting wear and tear on my car/oil changes.

If I were to live in the city during the week, my wife and I would trade in both of our cars for one car, eliminating my $236/mo car payment. She would drop me to and from the station at the beginning and end of the week and use the car all week as I wouldn't need it in the city. As I would only need to rent from Mon-Thurs night and would be home Fri-Sun, I could feasibly find a room for $400-450/mo with utilities included. A monthly train pass within city/adjacent suburb limits is $175/mo on top of rent. My cost to stay in the city would be $600-$650/mo.

From a purely financial perspective, would it make more sense to continue commuting, or staying in the city during the work week? Please let me know.

&lt;p&gt;$200 student loans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$236 car payment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$162 car insurance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$300 credit card payments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$300 food&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$400 misc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$150 pets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$100 health insurance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I commute 100 miles a day, 4-5 days a week spending ~$60-90/week on gas, averages around to $300/mo for my car alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then $205/mo for a train ticket into the city from the station. So my total commuting cost is $505/mo not counting wear and tear on my car/oil changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to live in the city during the week, my wife and I would trade in both of our cars for one car, eliminating my $236/mo car payment. She would drop me to and from the station at the beginning and end of the week and use the car all week as I wouldn&amp;#39;t need it in the city. As I would only need to rent from Mon-Thurs night and would be home Fri-Sun, I could feasibly find a room for $400-450/mo with utilities included. A monthly train pass within city/adjacent suburb limits is $175/mo on top of rent. My cost to stay in the city would be $600-$650/mo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a purely financial perspective, would it make more sense to continue commuting, or staying in the city during the work week? Please let me know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I think I've learned an invaluable lesson from visiting this sub reddit which is overcoming my fears of the credit card.  I've been listening a bit to Dave Ramsey (haven't read his books yet but I'm getting much out of his youtube videos and web content).  From what I gather, he's very anti-credit card.  Cut up your cards and budget yourself with cash.  There's also a perception that debt is bad and that you shouldn't have any.  I think there have been quite a few voices in my life that have echoed that same concern (fear) with credit cards and so I've always been cautious about that.  In fact, it wasn't until about 6 years ago that I actually got a credit card for the first time (I'm 40).

&amp;#x200B;

I started visiting this sub reddit and listening to other audiobooks like Rich Dad Poor Dad to gain more insight into personal finance/wealth accumulation and I'm coming to a different conclusion that is counter-intuitive to what's typically taught.  Here are my lessons which break conventional wisdom:

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 - Increase your credit limit.  Increasing your limit is a good thing because if you're financially responsible (you don't spend more as a result of the increase) and pay your card(s) off every month, you decrease your credit usage which will help your credit score.  The key is to always stay under 30% usage so that your credit score can increase/stay high.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2 - Use your credit card for everything.  This is fairly obvious - by using your credit card in place of a debit or check card, you're accruing points at a much faster rate which, if you're smart, can be redeemed for cash for further investing.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 - Get your money out of a traditional bank.  Banks are pretty horrible about paying you back for the privilege of using your money to make a profit for themselves.  Assuming your risk tolerance is agreeable to this, you can take that money and buy into a  money market mutual fund through a brokerage's cash management account and make quite a bit more than a traditional bank would dole out.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking these lessons together, you can actually EARN MORE MONEY by using your credit card for everything,  Not only are you generating points which can be converted to cash from all the credit card spending, but the money you would've used for day-day purchases can instead sit in a high yield investment for that month prior to being use to pay off the balance.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me back to Dave Ramsey. His contention is that if you have a credit card, you're likely to spend way more because you're not limited by the cash you have on-hand.  Yes, that's possible BUT if you realize you have to pay that money off in a month and keep an eye on what you're spending through that month, this shouldn't be a problem.  I think Dave is doing a disservice to many people who are financially responsible because the money that can be generated using the lessons above can be pretty significant.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is entirely based on the premise that you are a debt-free or at least debt-controlled human being. I wouldn't recommend this strategy if you struggle with debt or are loose with your spending and don't pay your bills on time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I'm not thinking of everything so I'd be interested to hear your views, thoughts, experiences or other lessons that you've come across.  If you disagree with my lessons, share that as well.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge disclaimer:  I never have an overdue  balance on my credit card, I pay the whole thing off every month. In fact, I&amp;#39;ve never paid interest on credit card debt that I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve learned an invaluable lesson from visiting this sub reddit which is overcoming my fears of the credit card.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to lay out where I'm at currently and some aspirations I have in the next few years and see if this is a feasible option financially. I am 21 years old and graduated university last December. I have a little less than a month's worth of expenses in savings ($800). Thankfully I have a decent job, live in a small town, and have cheap rent with roommates, meaning I can save quite a bit while I am here. My monthly income is around $1150, and with only about $850-900 in expenses, meaning even if I overspend a bit here and there I can reasonably put $200 per month into savings. I also have been receiving back child support payments from my ever-absent father (which recently have been about $50 a week,  but formerly had been as much as $60-70) but I have no basis for how much left/longer he has to pay on that or how consistently I will get it, so I just put it into savings and don't count it as part of my income for budgeting purposes. Thankfully my student loans only total just under $10,000 so that monthly payment is very manageable, and I have been considering adding more than the minimum payment to get that out of the way a little faster (especially as I currently get more income than expected per month with child support payments).  


Here is the catch: I don't want to stay here forever. In college I did a semester abroad in South America and loved it; I had traveled before and I have known for years that I want to live abroad. I am very interested in teaching English potentially and I have been furiously researching and reading r/TEFL, as well as watching videos and reading info from people who are experts in the area (Ben Teaches English Abroad is one that comes to mind). Looking at potential routes and job placements, I think the earliest I would possibly go is February/March 2020. I am hoping that I can increase my savings base to at least $2500 or more by that time. Even if I had to wait until a few months later, I could build a bigger savings and be more comfortable before I go. I feel like I would be doing well to have enough in a US account to cover my student loan payments for the year, as well as airfare and at least a month of (US rate) expenses should an emergency happen that requires me to head home early.   


I know that the big bucks/salaries are in Asia, but my heart is in South America and that's really where I'd like to go. Looking at some potential contracts, I think I could save $100-200 per month in most places that I may go. (Income is much lower, but cost of living is also much lower). If I decide that I like that job/career path, I can keep up with it, keep travelling, keep building my savings and paying off my loans, and potentially move into countries/roles that would pay me more and allow me to be more comfortable financially. Even if I come home not planning to return to that field, I feel like I would be OK as I would have that savings to fall back on and I could begin in a different direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've just recently in the past few months started looking at my financial future and looking at my options to invest. At the moment I've just been looking at less-risk options like high-interest savings accounts, CD accounts, and possibly even index funds.

My current finances are:

$19k in a checking account

$5k in cash

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated college with no debt, having attended a four-year university while commuting from home, and we're low-income so state/federal financial aid grants covered all my expenses. I've also been able to save \~85% of my earnings at my current job due to it being reasonably high-paying ($28+/hour after factoring in taxes and tips).

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the thing: my first post-grad job is a 6 month temporary (but possibly permanent) assignment in Hawaii that starts in a few weeks. My rent is $1000/month, and beyond just leisurely expenses and rent, I don't expect to be spending much beyond that. Pay is $22.12/hour, 40+ hours a week. I'm also receiving a lump sum relocation expenses payment of $1500, as well as a $2500 signing bonus. Within four years, if all goes well I expect to earn \~$70-80k salary/year. I also plan on living at my parent's home for at least another 5 years, if my work permits me to stay local.

&amp;#x200B;

My current short/long term financial goals are to save enough money for a 30-40% down payment on a house within 10 years to afford a two bedroom, 1 or 2 bathroom house/condo somewhere in Southern California (I'm currently based near downtown LA). With the two bedroom unit, I also plan on renting out the extra bedroom to help cover mortgage costs. My monkey brain also tells me to want to buy a decent two-door ""sports car"", as I do consider myself an automotive enthusiast and enjoy those kinds of things. Obviously making a $20-30k purchase on a depreciating asset is by far not the best decision to make right after college.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you all have any general advice for me? Are my financial goals a bit too far-reaching? What would you suggest to me, a complete novice when it comes to making investments? Should I stick to low-risk investments for now, and then possibly down the road get into more high-risk options?

Been applying to jobs the past few weeks and the interviews are starting to snowball in and I'm having trouble finding time to commit. I'll get that sorted out but need advice on how to handle offers.

&amp;#x200B;

I received a highly competitive offer from Company A. Benefits are great (11% match). It's also a non-profit so my student loans will continue to be enrolled in the PSLF program. 17 days of PTO. Low deductible healthcare plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Company B is a tech company, I have a in-person interview late next week. I believe their offer will be slightly higher (\~5-10k), healthcare 100% paid for, 4% match, unlimited PTO but a for-profit company which means my student loans will not be forgiven.

&amp;#x200B;

Company C is also a tech company. I am the final and only candidate I believe. I will be receiving an offer but they are relatively young and almost too close to being a startup. (50 employees, series B funding in 2017). I expect the compensation to be close to company A.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 40k in student loans with 7 years left until forgiveness.

I'd say company B is much more on the forefront of technologies and available tools for my career.

&amp;#x200B;

**I think I should lean towards Company A but I need advice on how to handle if/when the offer letters come in from B and C? Should I further negotiate if the pay is any different? Also how long can I hold off on signing an offer letter if I have already received it and should I be upfront about my situation?**

&amp;#x200B;

Again all companies will most likely be in line with their offer. I expect company B to be the highest but probably 5-10k at most higher.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

Hey all, would appreciate your insight into my  scenario: my colleague who basically does the same job as me left and  I've been stuck doing all of her work as they haven't hired anyone to  replace her (this has been about 4 months now). They are notorious for  not hiring people so I'm almost 100% sure they aren't going to hire  another person to help me out. My work also never has yearly reviews and  never gives raises unless asked and even then they just give inflation  based raises. So how much do you think I should ask for a raise? I mean  they are saving like $50,000  by not hiring someone else so I'd like to  ask for a $20,000 raise but I doubt that's likely after reading may of  the posts on here.

My salary is around $140k, but it is effectively $20k less than that because I am saving up for stock options in the company I am working for that vest at 1 year. I believe they will be a really good risk to take in the long run, but I need to value them at zero right now.

My partner is in dental school and is accumulating debt quickly - around $50k/year for tuition, food, rent, and all expenses. I want to balance minimizing that debt with starting to save. The bulk of that loan is (and, for the next three years, will be) on an unsubsidized Stafford loan at 6.66%.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help out, but I also am excited to start saving towards my future. We aren't engaged yet, but that is likely on the horizon and the debt will become \*our\* debt. I want to share the prosperity, but I also want to be fiscally responsible by maxing out my 401(k),  stock options, Roth IRA, saving for emergency funds, and then investing in 2-4 basic Index Funds.

&amp;#x200B;

I've proposed paying for both portions of rent as well as any shared food or meals out. I was originally thinking of contributing more, but that's a pretty big chunk of income already, and I'm not sure the investment towards tuition would be worth it vs just saving more in Index Funds.

&lt;p&gt;My salary is around $140k, but it is effectively $20k less than that because I am saving up for stock options in the company I am working for that vest at 1 year. I believe they will be a really good risk to take in the long run, but I need to value them at zero right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner is in dental school and is accumulating debt quickly - around $50k/year for tuition, food, rent, and all expenses. I want to balance minimizing that debt with starting to save. The bulk of that loan is (and, for the next three years, will be) on an unsubsidized Stafford loan at 6.66%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to help out, but I also am excited to start saving towards my future. We aren&amp;#39;t engaged yet, but that is likely on the horizon and the debt will become *our* debt. I want to share the prosperity, but I also want to be fiscally responsible by maxing out my 401(k),  stock options, Roth IRA, saving for emergency funds, and then investing in 2-4 basic Index Funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve proposed paying for both portions of rent as well as any shared food or meals out. I was originally thinking of contributing more, but that&amp;#39;s a pretty big chunk of income already, and I&amp;#39;m not sure the investment towards tuition would be worth it vs just saving more in Index Funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone been in a similar situation? Do you have any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

I currently have 11k saved and have not touched it since I created it in February. I realize if I buy this car I would have to live at home a bit longer than I originally planned just to save up again.

the plan is to put down around 10k for a down payment, and finance the rest over 60 months. my credit is great, believe its over 760, so getting a low APR isnt going to be an issue.

I realize I should be buying used, but the car is new and there isnt any used ones for sale yet.

Any advice is greatly appreciated! 



Current breakdown (roughly $165k)

-Schwab Checking: $2k. (fluctuates between 2-5k throughout the month) 

-American Express HY Savings: $17k (about $4k of this is earmarked for vacation/car insurance/other big semiplanned expenses for the year)

-New Employer traditional 401k: $2k and growing

-401K still in Fidelity from former employer: $43k (Roth:$23k / Traditional: $20k)

-Vanguard Investments:

Personal Investments: $48k

Roth IRA (employer rollover + last year max contribution +$4k YTD): $22k

Rollover IRA: $30k




Investment Strategy :

1. Maxing out 401k contributions for the year (traditional 401k is my only option): $19k; employer matches 4% fully vested this year, increase to 7% after 1 year of employment (the next 3% vests over 5 years... May not stay that long) 

2. Max out IRA contribution ($6k)

3. $2250 into HSA + employer match $750=$3k total

4. Transfer $1500 from checking into savings each month ($18k total for year— note that I just increased this with the new job, used to be $750/month)

4a. I usually let my savings grow to $18k or so and then move cash to Vanguard investments to bring savings down to $12k and then let it grow again.

5. Vanguard personal investments are split between ~10 ETFs, 3 mutual funds, the IRAs are almost solely VTSAX/VTI.

6. If I earn 26 paychecks per year, 2 per month go to expenses + savings contributions and the extra 2 at the end of the year plus any bonus are my vacation/large semiplanned expense fund for the calendar year. 


I earn $102k gross annually (just recently increased from $90k with a new job), and take home $2.2k per biweekly paycheck. 


I pay $1450 per month for a 1 bedroom apartment (this is well below market value for my area as my landlord is 90 and just wants someone living here), $80 for utilities/internet. After taking out savings, all other cash goes food/entertainment/gym/gas for the month ($1500). I own my car (5 year old Accord with 60k miles). 



Finally the question:

I live in an expensive area of NJ (Bergen county) and don't really want to give it up (40 minutes bus ride to Manhattan, hour drive to work), so I'm starting to think about buying a condo /co-op, rather than throwing money into rent each month.

How should I change my savings strategy to account for this?

Putting money into investments is great for interest growth, but getting the money back out may be costly for tax purposes?

I don't want to own something that requires too much maintenance, but then a lot of HOA fees around here are $1000+ —at that rate it almost makes me feel like renting is better?? (if something breaks I don't pay)


Thanks again for any advice!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I think I have a solid handle on my savings practices but in reading posts and other sources I&amp;#39;m wondering if I should be reallocating where I put my savings. Any advice is greatly appreciated! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current breakdown (roughly $165k)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Schwab Checking: $2k. (fluctuates between 2-5k throughout the month) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-American Express HY Savings: $17k (about $4k of this is earmarked for vacation/car insurance/other big semiplanned expenses for the year)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-New Employer traditional 401k: $2k and growing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-401K still in Fidelity from former employer: $43k (Roth:$23k / Traditional: $20k)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Vanguard Investments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal Investments: $48k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roth IRA (employer rollover + last year max contribution +$4k YTD): $22k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rollover IRA: $30k&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment Strategy :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maxing out 401k contributions for the year (traditional 401k is my only option): $19k; employer matches 4% fully vested this year, increase to 7% after 1 year of employment (the next 3% vests over 5 years... May not stay that long) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max out IRA contribution ($6k)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$2250 into HSA + employer match $750=$3k total&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transfer $1500 from checking into savings each month ($18k total for year— note that I just increased this with the new job, used to be $750/month)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4a. I usually let my savings grow to $18k or so and then move cash to Vanguard investments to bring savings down to $12k and then let it grow again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanguard personal investments are split between ~10 ETFs, 3 mutual funds, the IRAs are almost solely VTSAX/VTI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Thank you all for taking the time to read this. This community is incredible.

FYI I’ve created a throwaway account for personal reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Details**

27M

Single but hope to marry and have children

&amp;#x200B;

**The Situation**

I am leaving a good, stable career with high future earning potential. Current position – $75k salary in major city with low COL. Have been in current role for almost 2.5 years and can expect raise/promotion within a year. Maybe to $85-90k. To make a guess – it would not be at all surprising to be making $150k within 10 years – assuming good performance.

Leaving for a 2-year full time grad program (tier 1 school, top 10 program, great network) in another major city with higher COL which will leave me with $60k in debt. Masters essentially required for entry level positions in this new field. Very likely that I work in public or non-profit sectors upon graduation. The goal is to return to my home city (low COL) after the program. Expected salary directly after graduation $55-60k. Expected salary 2 years post-graduation $75k (right back where I started). In 10 years, it would be a very pleasant surprise if I was making $150k – likely hovering around $100k (and would expect this to be the ceiling).

Clearly from a financial perspective, this is not a good investment. This is your typical “I need to find fulfillment; my soul is dying!” career shift. Much can be debated, reflected upon, etc. on this topic. Grass isn’t always greener and stuff. I get it and I’m prepared mentally to be wrong about this venture. I’ve been through years of therapy (not for any explicit mental health disorder) and have researched/planned for this change for a couple years – though, admittedly I still I haven’t done enough. Not here for this conversation but something more specific. See questions below

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial stats not previously mentioned above**

Savings = $17k

401k = $40k (fully vested)

Undergrad debt = $9.5k ($6.5k at 3.4%; $3k at 3.86%)

No house

No car payment

790 credit score

&amp;#x200B;

**At School I expect…**

To make enough between part-time jobs and summer internship to cover rent and necessary living expenses. The $60k expected debt considers this/scholarship/health insurance/books and supplies but does not consider any usage of my savings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goal**

Buy a house by 32, or 3 years post-graduation. $180k buys a nice home in the city I intend to be living in.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions**

How do I handle my existing undergrad debt? Defer or continue to make full payments? I likely cannot work enough during school to fund this (as well as rent, living expenses).

How might I best plan to meet my goal of buying a house in 5 years? Completely unrealistic? Paying off my student loans as soon as is possible is certainly important, especially to prevent burdening potential SO and children.

Is there a creative way to use partially use my 401k? Considering my age and that these funds would ultimately assist in purchasing a home?

It’s very, very possible that I work at either a non-profit or with government for 10 years. Would it be advisable to plan to utilize the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Do I run the risk of denial into the program and adding significantly to my debt by using one of the federal repayment plans?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I’ve provided enough meat here for you all to sink your teeth into. Any responses, opinions, advice are very much appreciated. I’ll do my best to respond to questions.

For years, I've held the following mix of cards to try and maximize cash back rewards:

* Discover It (5% categories)
* Chase Freedom (5% categories)
* AMEX Everyday Blue Cash (3% groceries, 2% gas)
* Citi Double Cash (2% on everything)
* Wells Fargo Cash Wise (1.5% on everything \[used exclusively at Costco, which only accepts Visa\])

&amp;#x200B;

Every quarter, I write up a cards to put in my wallet and my wife's billfold relating which is the optimal card to use for various types of expenses that quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

However, we've reached a point where it feels like we need to simplify.  I'm considering going down to just one personal card, and one card for our small business.  Both cards would need to be Visa due to our frequenting of Costco, which only accepts Visa.

&amp;#x200B;

The small business card feels simple - there's the Captial One Spark Business card, which is a Visa and gets 2% on everything.

&amp;#x200B;

The personal card feels a little more complicated.  I'm considering going with the Chase Freedom Unlimited, at least for a year, as it gets 3% on everything for the first year, and then reevaluating as that year runs out.  I haven't done the math on how much we'd need to spend to make that 3% bonus rate more advantageous than other enrollment period bonuses  out there (like $150 for $500 spent in 1st 3 months on Quicksilver, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

Any insights would be much appreciated.

I was a full time student for a few years but I now have a sustainable income of about $2700 and recently inherited a large sum of money(\~$15,000).

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on using the inheritance to pay off two of my credit cards with the highest interest and part of my 3rd credit card.  This would leave me at $15,000 left on the credit card with the lowest interest rate (12.2%).  

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly expenses:

Utilities - $110

Internet - $55

Cell - $55

Food - $120

Gas - $100

Car insurance - $135

TOTAL = $575

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves me with a decent amount of left over money so I wanted to know what would be a good amount of money to put towards the debt each month?  I realize I should pay as much as I can afford, but what would be the recommended amount to keep in savings?  I have about $3,000 in savings at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the credit cards I have is a 'cash rewards' so is it possible to make payments with the cash rewards card and then pay it off immediately and still receive the rewards?  Or would it just be better to just pay straight from my checkings/savings account?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, my credit score has obviously taken quite a hit and has fallen from around 775 to 615.  My utilization is about 90% right now ($30,000 of $34,000).  I am trying to raise my score as quickly as possible so would you guys recommend getting another credit card to purely lower the utilization percentage?

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of context. I'm a 22yo living with his parents. I'm in Business School, specializing in Entrepreneurship on the weekends. I just got a new job (internship) that pays almost 3x what I was making before, but it's also further away from where I live and study, so I'll have around 2:30 to 3h in public transport everyday, compared to the 20 min I had before. That means I have little to no free time during the week, and part of the weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

I own a car that my father gave to me. I love it, but I sometimes feel it's a little too much for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to use my car everyday. With this new job, I don't think I'll be able to use my car during the week, so it would be basically a weekend car only. We only have one parking spot where we live, so we're currently paying a decent sum of money for a parking spot a couple of blocks away, so it's expensive and a pain to walk there everytime I have to use my car.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my father pays for all the costs of the car. He's not exactly complaining, but I'm sure he would be grateful if I reduced a few of those costs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a serious internal debate now. Having a car gives me the freedom to go anywhere I want with little trouble, and I might still use my car for work once in a while. But having an ""expensive"" car with little use feels a bit like a waste to me.

&amp;#x200B;

As a reference, my car is worth around R$ 53.000 on the used market (\~US$ 15.000, or around 53 minimum wages here). I could sell my car, Uber around when needed and invest the money (even to purchase another car when I feel the need to have one). Or I could sell my car and purchase a cheaper, smaller one that I could leave parked on the street. Or maybe just keep it, since my father is willing to cover the costs of maintaining the car?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone faced a similar situation, selling their car due to not being able to use it enough? I really enjoy driving, so that's kind of a big factor for me as well :(

I have the opposite problem to what many people seem to have, which is that I took a pretty well paying job in a rural area (about 40 minutes to an hour outside of my country’s capital city), and moved with my husband into a tiny studio apartment in the local community (there weren’t many housing options). My commute to work is only about 10-15 minutes by bus.

However, after 1 year at this job, this new set up has really been taking a toll on my mental health and quality of life. I work in a specific area of healthcare, which is particularly draining both emotionally and physically, with long and sporadically planned working hours. Because I am living in a more rural community, there are also very few activities and things to do, and few people in my age group (I am 26F). Our friends and family all live in the city, and we don’t have space in our studio apartment to host social gatherings. My husband and I feel very cramped and isolated, and I basically just spend all my time shuffling between my job and my tiny apartment. I take the train into the city about two to three times per month just to try and escape and do something fun. My husband is a masters student at the city’s university (good career prospects but, no income for the next 10 months). He has a long commute but his schedule is a lot more relaxed, so overall he tolerates it well.

So my question is, should we move back to the city? This would mean not only a longer commute to work for me (40 minutes to an hour) but also paying more than double what I currently pay in rent.

If it helps, here is a more detailed description of our budget converted to USD:

*side note: I am living in a Northern European country where my taxes pays for my healthcare and a quite decent pension plan

Income after all taxes, per month: about $3700-4000
 
Expenses for 2 people, per month:

We live a bit “bare bones” and have been doing so for a while but we hope to buy a home and start having children in the next 3-5 years, so I’m a bit lost trying to see if this move is feasible while still trying to secure a good future for us.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the opposite problem to what many people seem to have, which is that I took a pretty well paying job in a rural area (about 40 minutes to an hour outside of my country’s capital city), and moved with my husband into a tiny studio apartment in the local community (there weren’t many housing options). My commute to work is only about 10-15 minutes by bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after 1 year at this job, this new set up has really been taking a toll on my mental health and quality of life. I work in a specific area of healthcare, which is particularly draining both emotionally and physically, with long and sporadically planned working hours. Because I am living in a more rural community, there are also very few activities and things to do, and few people in my age group (I am 26F). Our friends and family all live in the city, and we don’t have space in our studio apartment to host social gatherings. My husband and I feel very cramped and isolated, and I basically just spend all my time shuffling between my job and my tiny apartment. I take the train into the city about two to three times per month just to try and escape and do something fun. My husband is a masters student at the city’s university (good career prospects but, no income for the next 10 months). He has a long commute but his schedule is a lot more relaxed, so overall he tolerates it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, should we move back to the city? This would mean not only a longer commute to work for me (40 minutes to an hour) but also paying more than double what I currently pay in rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it helps, here is a more detailed description of our budget converted to USD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*side note: I am living in a Northern European country where my taxes pays for my healthcare and a quite decent pension plan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Income after all taxes, per month: about $3700-4000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expenses for 2 people, per month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-rent: about $700 all inclusive (considering 1-2 bedroom apartments in the city for $1500-1800)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-food: $215&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-transport: $60 (would be $120 after a move to the city)&lt;/p&gt;

I am needing some advice on which way I should be pursuing my future. 

Right now I’m a single 24 y/o in Missouri, working in pharmaceuticals making about 44k per year pre tax so about 35k take home and still living with my parents rent free. I currently have 20k saved up and am already maxing my match into my 401k and my HSA, I also have ZERO debt against me and a 770 credit score. Right now I’m trying to decide between two paths:

1. Save up all my money and buy a starter house this winter to get some equity, either through conventional  loan or a HFA loan matched to a conventional rate if I get pre approved 

2. Live with the parents for one more year and increase my savings to around 60-70k, while also investing into a ROTH IRA and maxing that out this year and next. 

As of right now my parents have no problem with me staying at home since they like the company and I’m basically free manual labor.  Career is pretty rock solid since I work in regulatory and am getting a raise to 46k this month. I’m just trying to figure out what will be best for my financial future and I’m stuck between both these options.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello PF,&lt;/p&gt;

I have chosen to simply delete and bury the faulty email, and I will add a bit about being careful to not forward email-chains in our security newsletter this month instead. This way it will benefit everyone in the company to be wary of forwarding email-chains. The WHOLE chain will be forwarded.

Background information on the rental house. The total cost (P&amp;I/escrow/insurance) is $1500 and I charge $1500 for rent. I have about 21% equity in the house and it's total value is around $210-215k. It has appreciated from $189k in Jujly 2016. It is not a USDA Rural loan. I bought it in July 2016 and changed jobs, and decided to rent it out vs taking a bath on selling it. I am happy with the rent I get from it and it is a very low maintenance tenant. Maybe I am renting it for too cheap. It is .7% of the home value which I believe is low. It's a college town so renters are easy to find (not college students though). I will be living about an hour from the house so easy to get to it for any issues they have.

Happy Independence Day Americans, happy Thursday everyone else.

My siblings and I want to buy a house for our mother and need ideas on how best to make sure we each get back what we paid, or pay into all expenses evenly.

The house we want to buy will ideally be in MA or southern NH. I live in PA, but for reasons, I'll be the one taking the loan. (unless there's a better reason not to? I have a house already with my wife, we together used FHA. one sibling has a house, too, and the other doesn't and doesn't want to use up her chance to use FHA).

I will have a hard time proving to a bank that I can afford the house, but our plan is to take conservatorship of my mom (to which she has agreed, we just have to go through the process), charge her rent, and pay the rest of the house costs ourselves split 3 ways.

So if you've done this or something similar before, I'd appreciate ideas. If you can think of something I haven't thought of, let's discuss it.

Trying to get an idea of these things:

1) does a written, signed agreement suffice in making sure that people pay their shares of things? (I'm picturing something like: ""I will pay 1/3 of all costs. When we no longer need the house, I will receive 1/3 of the value. If someone wants to keep the house, they can pay me out."")

2) how do we prove to a bank we can afford this? my household income is $150k and my siblings' are both higher, but it might be easier from a documentation sense to not tell the bank about my siblings?

2a) is there a legal entity we can create that could own the house, and let that entity charge us for the house expenses?

3) are we muddying the waters by being her conservator and landlord? if it's ""reasonable"" rent, are we in the clear?

I’m 18, soon to be 19. Recently, my girlfriend and I both came to terms with the fact that we are adults, and naturally want to move out of our respective homes. We both live about 6 hours away from each other. After many long talks, we decided that we wanted to move in together. The decision was made that we would move to my town. 

Originally, I considered the fact that we are young, and wanted to look for a place to rent. However, my girlfriend is very attracted to the idea of owning a home, and I am too. Primarily that during renting the money goes “away” and if we were to buy a house our monthly payments would be towards the house, and therefore more meaningful. 

After a lot of research, I decided a home around the $100,000 price point would be a good fit for us, and at that price point we might be able to afford up to a 20% down payment. While searching for homes we would both stay with my mother, and secure jobs we would trust to pay the mortgage on the house. 

I suppose where my questions would start, is purchasing a home at this age wise? I’m aware it is a large undertaking and my main qualm with it is that we may want to move again in the near future, likely selling before the mortgage is complete. Is there a downside to this?

I probably left details out, so if anyone would want me to fill those in I would be happy to. I would appreciate any and all advice related to buying a home in general, financing, or my situation. Thank you.

[EDIT]: I just wanted to thank everyone again for any and all advice. I didn’t expect to get this many genuine comments. I have much to talk about with the gf tonight, I am looking forward to it!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll provide a bit of background information. I’m 18, soon to be 19. Recently, my girlfriend and I both came to terms with the fact that we are adults, and naturally want to move out of our respective homes. We both live about 6 hours away from each other. After many long talks, we decided that we wanted to move in together. The decision was made that we would move to my town. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, I considered the fact that we are young, and wanted to look for a place to rent. However, my girlfriend is very attracted to the idea of owning a home, and I am too. Primarily that during renting the money goes “away” and if we were to buy a house our monthly payments would be towards the house, and therefore more meaningful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of research, I decided a home around the $100,000 price point would be a good fit for us, and at that price point we might be able to afford up to a 20% down payment. While searching for homes we would both stay with my mother, and secure jobs we would trust to pay the mortgage on the house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose where my questions would start, is purchasing a home at this age wise? I’m aware it is a large undertaking and my main qualm with it is that we may want to move again in the near future, likely selling before the mortgage is complete. Is there a downside to this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We consider ourselves proficient at budgeting and wouldn’t mind making a few sacrifices to live with the independence of our own house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably left details out, so if anyone would want me to fill those in I would be happy to. I would appreciate any and all advice related to buying a home in general, financing, or my situation. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

I know that you get interrogated at airports if you have a lot of cash on you, so I'm keeping it all on a Visa credit card.

I'm currently 28yo and just finished medical school and moving onto residency. I'm making about 63k/yr and am deciding between keeping my life insurance policies and taking over them or just cancelling to get term life.


So I currently have 3 policies all from NY Life but to simplify things, I have a total of $500,627 in death benefit, my monthly premium is $349 and current cash value sits at $22,000. 


If I understand things correctly, I'm paying $4,188 in annual premiums and historically the insurance company has paid around 6% dividend, so I can expect to hopefully get around $1320 in dividends? (22k \* .06) . Currently my dividends are set to paid up additions, which I believe means the dividends are used to purchase more death benefit and cash value. If I were to keep these policies, I'm thinking of maybe switching to have dividends pay the premiums. If I continue to pay for the policies, would I eventually grow enough cash value that the dividends can cover all of the premiums? 


I'm also very confused with the concept of cashing out dividends. So last year I had around $5-6k in dividends that I cashed out to help pay for medical school expenses. I noticed that now my death benefits/cash value has decreased. Did it decrease because I had the paid up additions option for my dividends? 


Also, looking at my account online, my accounts say anniversary dividend is $216. I thought dividends were calculated on the cash value. I know dividends aren't a guarantee, but assuming they paid out 6%, shouldn't I be getting closer to $1320?


Now if I were to cancel all these whole life policies, I would probably purchase a 20 or 30-year term. My quick look at quotes indicated that a 500k 30-year term will cost me around $31/month or $372 annually. This would be farrrr less than the premium I have to pay if I kept the whole life insurance policies. 


Sorry for the long post but I felt like my parents were duped into getting whole life policies for all of us at such a young age and they don't even know how it works.

Her schooling for the next two years should be around 12,000 +/- for books and whatever type of scholarships she can apply for given her status. We only use her check for car payments and put the rest into our savings. We just plan on paying with a credit card for points and just pay it off. Unless we find a decent interest rate.

Current Budget /  Expenses

I typically work 116 hours every 2 weeks. 

If I work 116 hours I make 1571 after taxes, 84 hrs (no OT) 995 after taxes. (I do not live off my OT, I am using it to put away money for our future plans and yes you're going to ask no way I can survive working that much.) I enjoy what I do and if I am able to work that much I am going to take advantage of it.

My Wife brings hope roughly 600$ per check. We use hers to pay off our car payment and the rest just goes into savings.

**Expenses**

Rent - 830 (Including Utilities) Landlord is a friend of mine that I work with.

Car Payments - 776 (She has a 2017 Honda with 0.9% and 11k left on the loan and we currently pay 400$ which is over the monthly payment.) I made a stupid decision with my car and it was leased. (That ends next March)  Would you consider paying off her car and not worry about a car payment?

Car Insurance / Renters insurance - 125 (per check withdrawn directly from check) I will have to call around and see if we can get this lowered. We both have spotless driving records.

Phone - 103$

RC Willey - 187 (12 months no Interest) Will be paid off in 9

Groceries - 200$

Kitten Food / misc - 100$

Gas - 120$ ( every 2 weeks we each fill up our car 30$ per tank)

Hulu / Netflix - 35$

Personal allowances - 100$ (total)

401k - 40$ (Enough for match)  457 - 40$   Roth IRA - 40$ (All deposited per my check every 2 weeks) I am looking to up at least my 401k and possibly my Roth

Health Insurance - 45$ per check that we deposit into our HSA We have a HDP (Currently have 2600$)

Savings - Minimum 1400$ per month

Emergency Funds - 1000$ immediately accessibly from our Credit union. 32000 in Discover HYSA

Sorry if the formatting seems poor I don't usually makes posts like this but if it doesn't make sense I will do my best to fix it.

**Goals**

I just turned 24 and my Wife will be 21 in December. 
We plan on getting myself a new car next March, we plan on getting a Hybrid or EV.  Nothing is set in stone, but just what we've been looking at.

Also plan on looking for a home in 3 years but before any type of home decision is done though, My wife currently has DACA, we were married last year and started the process to get her Citizenship, but as some of you know. That moves at a snail pace and politically that is in a tough spot. So that is a huge wrench.

**Ending** 
We are allocating a lot of money into our savings so we can put a decent chunk of that into the new car for next year and eventually a home. I do our finances and sit down with her on a monthly basis to keep her in the loop. There isn't a lot of time for Vacations and we both understand that. Once she is done with school and hopefully gets her Citizenship we will go do something. Until then we are just grinding.

I called my insurance company and asked which hospital I should go to. They said that it did not matter which ER as a $300 copay  would cover all costs- they told me to go to the nearest ER since it was an emergency. So I went to the nearest ER and was treated. I paid the $300 copay and I thought that would be the end of it.

About a month later, I got a letter from my insurance company saying that the doctor I saw at the ER was out of network and that I may receive a bill from that doctor. They told me that even if I am billed I will not have to pay the billed amount as I already paid the copay. They said to call if I got a bill. 

On or around 5/24/19, I got a bill for over $600 that said it was “due now”. I immediately called the insurance company. They said they would take care of it and I should not worry. They said it should take 30-45 days to resolve. 

I should have followed up sooner but I forgot. I finally remembered to call the insurance company on 7/1/19. It turns out nothing had been done! The woman I spoke to put in the wrong inquiry and now it was going to take another 45 days to resolve.

Well, today I got the second bill for the same amount and it says that if it’s not paid in 10 days they will send it to collections. The statement date is 6/28/19. Is 10 days counting the holiday and weekend? 

Again, I called the insurance company immediately. They said they will call the providers office on Monday and resolve it then. 

I’m afraid this providers office is going to send the bill to collections because my insurance company is apparently useless. If this bill is sent to collections do I have any chance in fighting it? I don’t have $600 to give anyone. This is so frustrating because I’ve done everything my insurance company instructed me to do but they have been no real help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2019 I went to the ER after visiting Urgent Care because they suspected I was passing a kidney stone.

What I do,

Current full time student (Undergrad)

Work 20-30 hours a week at minimum wage in California

Summer- work 40+ hours 12.50 at internship in Colorado

Summers- no required expenses other than gas

School- only food, school supplies, and anything I want to do to enjoy my life a bit more

How I manage my money

Discover it card for the rotating 5% cash back

Citi double cash back for the 2%

Use my credit cards as my debit card but pay both in full every month

Keep $500 in my checking to pay off my credit cards

Keep $500 in my savings to refuel my checking before pay day if something happens

Throw the rest in Marcus high interest account

Debt

Roughly 19,000 in student loan debt (subsidized) {Final year in college so that's it for my undergrad}

Goals

Go into my masters program the fall after I graduate

Some notes

&lt;p&gt;Go into my masters program the fall after I graduate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some notes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the liquidity I possess in case unforeseen expenses arise as well as the limited risk as if something happens to my job. Post college I&amp;#39;m currently expecting a job with a great post graduate salary as well as bonuses (still looking for more because you never know).&lt;/p&gt;

I want to give as much detail as I can.  My husband and I are both in our mid-30s, been married for 9 years, with a 7 year old son.  My husband works as a retail district manager and I do freelance virtual assistant work from home (I  work about 20-25 a week). Our annual income is about $97k.  With student loans and credit card debt, we are currently about $35k in the hole.  We both have cars, but both cars are paid off and in good shape. Both of our credit scores are in the mid-600s.  We currently live in a really nice 2 bedroom apartment in a gated community and pay $2075.  Including rent, phones, utilities, insurance, and debt payments (CCs and student loans) we are paying close to $4500 in bills a month.  After taxes &amp; what not, my husband and I bring home about $6,200  a month leaving us with usually about $1500-1700 for household expenses for the month which you would think would be fine, but we are just SQUEAKING by and are unable to save at all.  Our dream and our #1 goal is to own our own home, even though we know it’s a shitty time to buy.  Next March my husband gets his big LTI bonus and we have always been planning on using that for our down payment.  But we know we are in no shape at this point to even consider buying a home until we figure out how to budget and pay down our debt.  

My husband and I both grew up lower middle class with parents that did not know how to manage finances either.  His mom just filed bankruptcy.  His dad is about to lose his home.  My parents arent any better.  Although they own a home, my dad worked 2 jobs all his life (my mom is a homemaker), just recently retired, and besides the house they have no savings and are constantly borrowing money.  It makes me so sad to see my dad who worked hard &amp; honest since he was 16 not be able to afford to take a damn vacation. 

I don’t want us to go down that road.  We’re both college-educated...not that it makes any difference nowadays...and we both have good jobs.  I work only about 20-25 hours a week, and that was a choice both of us agreed on so that I can be at home with our son and involved at his school.  We only had one child because we knew having another would put more strain on our finances and I couldn’t do that to us.  We want to give our son the life we never had.  The nice home in a nice community, vacations, travel, etc.  

But we’re still fucking struggling and it fucking sucks.  

Since the beginning of our marriage I have managed our family finances just because my husband is a procrastinator and bills would never be paid.  He’s trusted me to take care of our finances, and I’ve failed miserably.  I have no idea what I am doing wrong.  At the beginning of each month, I sit down and figure out bills &amp; budget for that month and everything looks good.  But then by the end of that month, we are broke.  We are always broke and I fucking hate it.

We are friendly with a couple at church.  They are the same age and make about the same amount.  They have 2 children, a nice home, and are constantly talking about ‘saving for their next vacation’...they go on small fun trips like 2 or 3 times a year.    YES IM SUPER JEALOUS but also curious.

I used to work for a contractor that supplies support staff for the client’s store renovations. I’m good at my job, and was exceptionally good for being an employee of that company. I caught the eye of a project manager and ended up working on store renovations almost exclusively for several months.

I got really fed up with the contractor (knew I’d be moving in the nearish future and the inconsistent hours made budgeting impossible) and asked the project manager for a job with the client company. He told me of a posting to apply for and I did and got the job.

My last full year of working as a contractor I made $22,000. I expected to be making around $30,000-$35,000 with this new job. I was offered $40,000 and immediately accepted. I was just so happy to be making almost double and so happy to be made the offer to begin with. I think I was worth that amount then but probably could have negotiated higher.

My contract ends next March and I know I’m much more valuable now. Even 3-4 months after signing this contract I’m worth more than what I make. I’ve grown so much and another project manager has said it’s his responsibility to get me to an even higher level - I have ambitions and they know it.

I really, really like this company and the people I’ve met (very little interactions with HR - two different interviews for 2 different departments and no HR person showed up) so I don’t want to insert foot in mouth. I know that my current contractual situation isn’t a long term goal, but not to sound arrogant, I’m a catch and they’re stupid to get rid of me.

I want to be able to get paid what I’m worth (I’m not trying to rip them off) without being rude or too aggressive. I don’t have those personality traits and I don’t want to be perceived as that kind of person.

If all things go well, I will be running the store level renovations (everything to do with the day-to-day “get it done” will be my responsibility and still be overseen by a manager to deal with operations and logistics). That’s a huge step up from where I started and my pay needs to reflect that. I was thinking maybe $45,000 is fair. But that might be me low balling myself and I am tempted to go as far as $50,000 but a 20% year-over-year salary increase is a lot to ask.

This company is a national company in Canada and has very deep pockets. They have line items in their investor report regarding my area of work that are in the tens of millions.

yesterday my parents said to me that sometimes there is 5 Friday's (Payday's ) in a month so i should pay £250 for those months, but I don't understated. I don't get paid for 5 weeks work in those months and it's not like i'm living there rent free for a week because it only ever spills into the new working month by 1 or 2 days, can some explain if i'm right or if they're right please

Summary; fidelity or vanguard for incoming college student with 2k to invest? And possible investments?

I have worked a low paying job for the last few years and have 2k in savings ready to invest. I will likely be getting a monthly income around $100-200 while I’m in college for the next 4 years, which can all go into investments as I’m fortunate enough for a scholarship.

I have a few questions. Should I go with vanguard or fidelity? I’ve heard vanguard is owned by its clients, which is an advantage and also how they manage your index funds for you. I’m not planning on being too involved with my financial portfolio. I’ll likely follow a buy and hold strategy for 15+ years with consistent monthly investments into diverse mutual funds and index funds. Some pluses I’ve heard about fidelity are the zero commission tradings, but I’m not sure how relevant that is in my case. Also they have better app UI apparently.

Which company should I go for?

I understand housing there is much cheaper than in NY, though I'm not sure how the rest of my budget would look. The job is offering between $23,724 - $43,896 a year.

I may be moving out of state and on my own within the next couple of months. If i move out of state it would be to work as a correctional counselor for the state of WV. I understand housing there is much cheaper than in NY, though I&amp;#39;m not sure how the rest of my budget would look. The job is offering between $23,724 - $43,896 a year.

&amp;#x200B;

To keep a long story short, my ex-girlfriend and I were living together at an apartment that we just renewed our lease for. Things turned for the worst and she wants me to get out and go live somewhere else. I don't want to make this a big deal for the both of us and I just want to get out of there, so I agreed to leave peacefully. However, as stated previously our lease was just renewed a month ago, it is a 12 month lease -- 10 more to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bank account: Give or take $100 between checking and savings.

Loans: I have 10k left on my car loan and about 45k in student loans.

I work part time as I am a student and roughly make $900-$1000 a month. Car takes $388 of that... not a good decision as an 18 year old. I strongly recommend not buying a car at 18.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what steps I can take to break this lease or how I should go about this. Financially, I can't afford to get out of there. Additionally, we have just purchased furniture on my credit card which was suppose to be split between us, the total is roughly $1500. My credit score is decent for my age, \~730-740 at 22, and I don't want this to ruin it, based off my credit card balance and my name on the lease. She's already pretty terrible at paying things on time and I don't want her to bring me down with her. If there is no way out of this without just paying my way out then I am toast. Is there a way to preserve my credit in this process of going under??

They also forced me to live in a convent - I can’t get out because this place costs about £7500 a year to live in. In this city the absolute lowest rent prices are £9000. Luckily my school offered a grant of £3000 to supplement my student loan. However this was calculated based on my rent, which is way below the margin of anything realistic in the area. That’s how I’m still stuck in the situation. 

I made up the bare difference from thevjobs I had alongside studying (tutoring, babysitting, and upselling 
 designer pieces). However I was never able to get a real job - the cafes and stores wanted someone with experience in these jobs. I was never allowed to get a job before 18 - I went to a boarding school and in holidays my parents refused to let me out of the house. I had no savings and as a result I just haven’t been able to save up to get myself out of the situation. I really tried - many weeks I hardly ate, barely left the house because I could pretty much only afford rent and transport to school. I could eat out from time to time, but definitely couldn’t go out. I missed so many classes that I had to defer an exam to August, but somehow I managed to scrape a really good grade with the 3 other modules - this means I can at least get an internship for next summer which will lead to a real job. But for this year applications are closed.

On top of this I’m at law school, which is incredibly time consuming - there really isn’t time for too many distractions as it is. 

I tried to apply for many paid internships for this summer, but I couldn’t get any of them - I know this is mostly because my first year grades couldn’t get me into the competitive schemes. I otherwise have a very strong track academic record, and already 5 internships at top firms/companies and go to one of the best law schools. However a lot of the other paid internships (non “city” jobs, in-house, fashion-related etc) I applied for were probably put off by the fact that my past experiences were city firms (and they can assume I got them due to connections since I’m only 19). Some of them I failed the online character tests, despite passing numerical and written tests. Others simply didn’t respond, or didn’t give feedback when I asked. Some said I was too shy! 

So on top of my finances I’m now worried about my career but I accepted that I just need the money. But even with the lower requirement jobs, in retail and service, experience was needed. I have to move out of the convent in 2 weeks and I literally have no money. For the past few weeks I have been babysitting for my sister who is kind to be paying me £8 an hour (she knows my parents have abandoned me and the full extent of the situation but isn’t fully willing/able to help out. She’s pregnant and has an 8 month old baby). From this job I don’t actually make a profit unless I work for 4 hours at a time, because of transport costs. And usually she only wants 3 hours. 

Her husband of 2 months, who has known of me for only 2 years, and does not know me at all, keeps insinuating that I’m only in university to keep my parents happy and I should just quit- he works in sales and didn’t go to university. My sister works in finance and is the higher earner by a lot, however with maternity leave pay she is obviously the lower earner). 
For me, dropping out is out of the question - I worked very hard to get into this university. I know that even if I graduate with the worst grades here, it is still a big deal to have attended and graduated. However, I am much more capable and still ambitious and I still want to do really well and I have a lot of specific goals I want to realise. I have a business idea I’m working on for example, and it’s something I’ve wanted since I was 12. But right now I’m slipping to a point where I’m living “paycheck to paycheck” and hardly being paid at all. I also have to leave the convent, and I’m 3 weeks behind on rent, and have no place to go. I also have an exam in 6 weeks. 

I am actually formally trying to apply as an independent student for the next academic year so I can get a realistic student loan - this. Basically involves me cutting off my parents. I also need proof of why/how I’m estranged but because of certain circumstances it’s close to impossible.

I owned a joint mortgage with my ex-fiance, as well as a second down payment assistance mortgage with him, we were very young when we bought the house and didn't have much money.

Separate from that, I also had a car loan.

I filled out and submitted a form 108 (which I have copies of and I am looking at right now) and checked off that both mortgages will be retained by the co-debter and that I will retain the car and continue to pay the car loan.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to buy a house now that two years have passed and  I just checked my credit reported and Transunion stated that my second down payment assistance mortgage and car loan were filed in the bankruptcy.

Equifax and Experian do not even acknowledge that I had the second down payment assistance mortgage at all. It is not listed on my credit report at all and they both state the car loan was included in the bankruptcy.

&amp;#x200B;

My main mortgage with my ex IS listed on all three reports and was stated that it was NOT included in the bankruptcy because it wasn't, the house was not foreclosed. So how is it that my two mortgages and car loan were all listed on the same form but only my mortgage was the only one stated as not in the bankruptcy?

Also while my second mortgage for the down payment assistance says that it was released in the bankruptcy, IT WASN'T, my ex continued to pay that and paid it off fully when he sold the house.

Also my car loan wasn't released in the bankruptcy either, no one came to get my car and it is now fully paid off.

Can I pick your brains about something?

I have an old pension from my gov’t job back in Canada (I’m a citizen but living in NYC). I honestly forgot about it until recently, when I called to get some details about it. 

I only contributed for 3 years, but it is vested. I have the option of taking a lump sum payment of 19k CDN  (I would obviously wait until the CDN dollar goes up) or getting the lifetime payment of $150/month CDN until I die. 

Obviously the pension is “worth” more than 19k if I take the lifetime payment option but I am wondering if it’s a smarter decision to just cash it out and invest it in my IRA as I am currently 30 and have quite a few years before retirement. 

What’s my move here PF?

Here is my situation:

1. I am mid/late-30s and live in California, USA.
2. I do not have a house, nor car, but know how to make this work and keep my expenses low, about $1,000-$2,000mo.. Most of my net worth is tied up in crypto, currently \~$125,000. But we all know those winds can change. That is my retirement money. I have an additional $30,000 in a bank. I work irregularly as a freelancer and consequently try to stay very liquid in case of an emergency or dry spell with work. I fully subscribe to everyone having a suitable liquid emergency fund.
3. I have no revolving debt...once in my 20s digging out from a mountain credit card debt was enough, and I promised myself to never carry a revolving balance again. If I can't afford something immediately, it is a luxury I have not yet earned.
4. I see the debt-free finish line. My total remaining student debt is \~$850. (Down from a $30,000 principal fifteen years ago.) The interest rate is an absurdly favorable 2.8%. My loan payment is $114/mo. For anyone reading this, yes, I know that is low...there was an opportunity to consolidate in the mid-2000s and I took it. I have no idea how I'd afford school now at 6%+.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is: What are the pros/cons of paying off this remaining student debt early?**

I could put the same $850 into crypto and in nine months, it will (likely) gain far more than the interest I will have paid. Or even an index fund would be solid.

But there is also the *psychology of just being* ***done*** *and debt free*. How does one evaluate the opportunity cost of that feeling against ""smart choice"" to wait and continue to pay it off over nine more months? That is nine months of stress.

All comments welcome. I'd really just like to hear second opinions and I'll reply as best I can. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT**: When I say, ""crypto is my retirement plan"", that is paraphrasing a larger strategy. I'm playing catch-up on not having been in a good financial place for about 5yrs. Stop-loss orders are set, and I'm up about 300-400% (depending on the day) since January. I'm starting to take profits and starting to explore more traditional plans -- the first part of that is being debt-free, clean slate.

&lt;li&gt;In debt £900 on a 0% credit card&lt;/li&gt;

Title is self explanatory, but the background is pretty important.  

I'm a professional school graduate student, and I am in my last year of school. I currently have approximately $34k in loans, and I am on course to graduate after an taking additional $40-50k in loans over the coming 16 months or so (approximately $80k in debt at graduation in 5/2020 - likely first paycheck afterwards in 11/2020). First scheduled repayment is on 12/2020. These loans have a 6-7% interest rate (after this year, my weighted average interest rate will be around 6.5%).  

I am currently in an internship that, in more cases than not, results in a full time job offer. Given everything so far, I believe it is probable that I will have a job with a first paycheck around 11/2020.  

All that said, I am currently contemplating between maxing out my IRA contributions this year and just borrowing that much less in the coming months. Functionally, this will be equivalent to taking out a loan at 6.5% rate to contribute to IRA. I know this is unreasonable in most scenarios *BUT*  

I am liquidity constrained until I start my job since the job, if I get it, will likely be for a $190k/yr that I expect to hold for at least a few years (with annual lock-step raises). I will be in a high-local-tax market, so my first year take-home should be around $100k. I think I can pay off the loans reasonably quickly without too much of a belt-tightening (modest projections suggest 3 years; possible lower rate refinancing as well). Consequently, I see this as a question of the long term (20+ yrs) benefits of starting an IRA a year early VS less loans/risks in the medium term (~5yrs). I am a pretty risk averse person, so my investment returns will likely be lower than the loan rates (especially given risk exposure). In case it is relevant, I am in mid twenties, so I am a *very, very long* way from retirement.  

I found a few discussions online on the subject, but most were for current workers contemplating paying excess income towards paying off existing student loans vs higher IRA contributions.

&lt;p&gt;I just took out a student loan of $15k at 10% interest. Still not a great interest rate but better than 25%. We can pay more than interest now on it while we are still in school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I previously had a student loan which I was making monthly payments on and was at $12k. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now our total Debt on my report is $27.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the midst of taking out the loan I got 4 hard pulls, and a new account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I logged on the credit karma today and both transunion and Equifax, as well as creditwise from my capital one account ALL jumped up to 730. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huhwhat?????? How does this make any sense? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain why this move on my credit would make it go up? I&amp;#39;ve been trying to move things around to get my husbands score up above 700. We both need to be above 700 for next years move. But I was convinced mine was going to take a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

I've also seen a lot of rule of thumb methods described, explaining practical steps to manage money and wealth on a day-to-day basis. But I haven't seen much discussion on double-entry bookkeeping (DEB), which is the universal standard for keeping accurate track of an entity's financial position and performance over time and has been used by virtually every business with no fundamental change since the 14th century. 

&amp;#x200B;

From experience, I know that many people are quick to discount using DEB for private finances because it is too hard; they assume you need to be an accountant to do it or that it will take too much of their time. I think that used to be the case until a few years ago but now there are a bunch of readily available cloud accounting software that will connect directly to your bank accounts, credit cards, mortgage, investment accounts, etc and reduce most of the 'back-office' work that used to come with keeping a ledger. I personally use Xero (disclosure: no association with them, just a happy customer) and find that their UX is extremely intuitive and easy to use.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you are set up and your day-to-day transactions start coming through the Xero feed, it only takes a few minutes every other day to keep it all perfectly balanced and reconciled - not only just income and expenses but changes to assets and liabilities too. I think this is much easier and less stressful than my previous 'method' which involved a periodic session to review what had happened in the last month/period and didn't include the self-balancing, error-correcting mechanism of DEB.

&amp;#x200B;

Through DEB you can have perfect and instant visibility of your financial position at any given point in time (the relationship between your assets, liabilities, and equity) and your financial performance over a time period (the relationship between income, expenses, and profit/loss) down to each cent. From that base, setting up and tracking goals, setting up a budget and then comparing it to actuals, planning for retirement or major purchases, it all becomes very easy.

&amp;#x200B;

Keeping a ledger will fundamentally change your financial mindset - everything becomes very clearly connected. You will start to appreciate that every single economic event that you are a party to affects you twice as two opposing quantities of cause and effect. Going from a non-DEB to a DEB system is like going from navigating using a compass and a few points of reference to having a GPS producing detailed, highly accurate information about where you are, where you are going, and your options for getting there.

“Double-entry bookkeeping is borne of the same spirit as the system of Galileo and Newton… With the same means as these, it orders the phenomenon into an elegant system, and it may be called the first cosmos built on the basis of mechanistic thought. Double-entry bookkeeping discloses to us the cosmos of the economic world by the same method as, later, the cosmos of the stellar universe was unveiled by the great investigation of natural philosophy… One can scarcely conceive of capitalism without double-entry book-keeping: they are related as are form and context.

I have been paying attention to my credit score closely over the last 6 months or so. I signed up to clear score and have a score of 460/700.

Only other stipulation is 4 people must comfortably fit, so I am thinking a larger sedan or smaller SUV. I buying a brand new vehicle, technically can use it for 4 years.

**My situation**- my car is a payed off 2012 with 90k miles and decent shape. Needs a little work but nothing huge, but still an aging vehicle. So my options are a) sell personal, buy company car b) keep personal (3rd car for me&amp; expecting wife), and buy company car c) decline company car and rent a car for long trips. My trips will be occasional 3-6 hours one way rather than short run arounds every day, so rentals are actually feasible, just annoying.

Looking for advice, if anyone can help. If I do buy a car, what $ range should I be looking? All maintenance $ is accounted for in fixed monthly payments, so I won't be reimbursed for anything needing fixed. Any tax considerations that I'm not thinking about?

Background: married couple, early 20s, no kids, living in the Seattle area, I am salaried and my husband is self-employed. We purchased a 2bed 2 bath condo for $314,950 and put 10% down. We would have been able to put 20% or more down but we decided to go with 10%. 

PURCHASE

- $10,000 earnest money

- $625 appraisal

- $75 homeowners course (mandatory)

- $25,499 closing cash

Total = $36,199


FURNITURE: $4,991

CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS: $3,085

MOVING = $131 (2 Uhaul trucks on separate days, fuel)

JUNK REMOVAL = $394 (old vanities, misc junk)

PLUMBING = $1,859

INSURANCE = $292 (HO insurance through Progressive for 1 year)

REIMBURSEMENTS = -$1,839 (escrow overpayment)


Total Cost = $45,082


Improvements:
- new vanities in both bathrooms, new faucets and shower heads;

- replaced vinyl with laminate flooring in the kitchen, entryway and bathrooms;

- painted the walls and ceilings throughout;

- painted kitchen cabinets (it made a HUGE difference);

- replaced power outlets and light switches;

- new bathroom and kitchen fixtures.

We saved A TON of money by doing most of it ourselves. I guess it depends on how comfortable each person is with this sort of thing but it was not too difficult. It took us one month, more or less, to complete the project and have a clean home. When taking on a remodeling project, it's important to know what your limits are. For instance, we decided it is best to contract a plumber for moving the toilets around, moving the piping in the shower, etc. and that was the only professional involved in our little DIY project. Thankfully, we did not have any unpleasant surprises or hidden issues which could have been costly. 

Bottom line, I am happy with the results and with the fact that we added at least $25k in value by spending roughly $6k on cosmetic improvements.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband and I purchased our first home in May.

I  know there is a list of recommendations on the sidebar, and I've done  research into them and lots of searching through the sub for different  posts trying to help me make a decision, but from googling and looking  at reviews and different posts, I'm not sure which ones I should go  with.

&amp;#x200B;

I  also know I'll probably get a lot of comments saying ""it doesn't matter  just pick one and go with it"" since they all are very similar. However,  the purpose of this post is not to get a definitive ""which is the best  one"" because I know that no bank is perfect and they all have their pros  and cons, but I'd like to get the opinions of the people on this sub in  regards to their experience with these banks and what they liked or  didn't like about it.

&amp;#x200B;

The banks I'm considering are:

* Alliant Credit Union
* Discover
* Ally
* Charles Schwab

&amp;#x200B;

I  know Charles Schwab doesn't have a real savings account, so I don't  know if that would be the best option or if you actually would recommend  having checking/savings in different banks (although overdraft  protection \[though i don't intend to overdraft\] with a savings at the  same bank might be better?). I also understand that none of these allow  cash deposits ( with the exception of Alliant at certain ATMs, but I  don't think I have many of those deposit accepting ATMs near me ) but I  plan on opening a PNC student account to handle cash deposits.

&amp;#x200B;

Really  I'm looking for something with a high interest on savings and minimal  fees so I can deposit checks and have my cash in a bank account instead  of sitting in a jar at home. I also want to deposit checks online but I  think all of them allow that. Good customer service is also best since  all of these banks are all online. I've heard good things about Ally and Alliant but I've also seen a lot of reviews that say they have awful customer service. What's your story?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance everyone!!

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  know Charles Schwab doesn&amp;#39;t have a real savings account, so I don&amp;#39;t  know if that would be the best option or if you actually would recommend  having checking/savings in different banks (although overdraft  protection [though i don&amp;#39;t intend to overdraft] with a savings at the  same bank might be better?). I also understand that none of these allow  cash deposits ( with the exception of Alliant at certain ATMs, but I  don&amp;#39;t think I have many of those deposit accepting ATMs near me ) but I  plan on opening a PNC student account to handle cash deposits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really  I&amp;#39;m looking for something with a high interest on savings and minimal  fees so I can deposit checks and have my cash in a bank account instead  of sitting in a jar at home. I also want to deposit checks online but I  think all of them allow that. Good customer service is also best since  all of these banks are all online. I&amp;#39;ve heard good things about Ally and Alliant but I&amp;#39;ve also seen a lot of reviews that say they have awful customer service. What&amp;#39;s your story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance everyone!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: Not going to go with Schwab bank due to their requirements and my lack of any real credit or banking history but still open to all of your opinions on the other institutions listed :)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a newly 19 year old, 1st year apprentice (almost 2nd year) working in Air conditioning and refrigeration in NSW Australia, earning a whopping $12.68 an hour (the bare minimum possible under the Electrical, Electronic and communications Contracting award 2010) while to Americans etc, this sounds fine and in some cases good, it really isn't. 

I've recently found out other apprentices in the same position as me (while at different companies, but same award) are being paid more, lots more, ranging from $16 to $21/hr. while legally the company I work for aren't doing anything wrong, I just feel like abused, cheap labour.
considering I work 38 hours a week minimum and get an amazing $450 ish a week, I'm finding it really uncomfortable to live.

Between rent, insurance, phone bills, normal bills such as water, gas and electricity, fuel, food and paying for my car I'm not left with really any money to save and without the payments I receive through the Trade support loan, I don't think I would be able to make ends meet, although work still require that I put money into buying tools.

The work I am doing for what I am receiving out of it feels really, really unfair and I'm finding it hard to be happy in my day-to-day. considering most my days are spent with lots of manual handling, heavy lifting, crawling through rooves and being cramped up, and then on top of that feeling intense pressure to live upto unrealistic expectations set by higher-ups on the job, it really just doesn't seem worth it to me. I've been told quite a lot that ""you get a trade at the end of it"", it still doesn't mean a lot considering it is not a field I can see myself working in for more than a few years after my apprenticeship and that most tradesman I talk to at work are only making $60,000 a year, half of the tradesman aren't even 30 and are in constant pain.

* This was for TFS to remove a 30-day credit marker from February of 2016, where I reached 30 days late on February 4, 2016 for my 2014 Toyota Tacoma account.

* Long story short: I had overpaid for a 2014 Tacoma V6 SR5 4x4 Double Cab 6MT at a San Antonio dealership in November 2013, without negotiating the purchase price and rolling negative equity of $8300 from a 2013 Scion FR-S. (returned the next day to cancel purchase, dealer refused). I was paying $711.40 at about 4.45% APR, due on January 5, 2014 as the first payment and 5th every month.

* I later stupidly bought an expensive used truck (2010 SVT Raptor) to replace it in October 2014, but did not trade it in the Tacoma, expecting to sell it privately. I also put up that new purchase for sale within just 6 weeks of ownership, upon an elder cousin's advice.

* I got to a point where I was regularly 28-29 days late to even manage, starting in the fall of 2015 (TFS granted 2 month relief over summer 2015 TX disasters). 

* By late 2015, I had been trying to sell it privately for 1 year (plus renting it out through Turo) and struggled with inquiries (manual transmission), when another vehicle of mine (Focus ST) got stolen (by a buyer/test drive) in December 2015 (that I had for sale) in Dallas. (long story)

* In order to not spook Ford Credit and dealing with uncooperative Dallas law enforcement, I was forced to keep paying for that other car throughout early 2016 and thus, diverting funds I couldn't. Plus pay a ""ransom"" of $6,200 (fake repair scam to prevent mechanic's lien) to retrieve it.

* Last minute, TFS rejected a payment extension request in early February 2016 and as a result, I was unable to pay them $711.40 before it reached 30 days. With help, I paid them $1,422.80 at the end of February 2016 to avoid repo in March. I paid them another $711.40, paid off the account and sold the truck on April 1, 2016 to Carmax.

* **My problem is, although I politely addressed CEO/President Mark Templin in one letter touting his own accomplishments and explaining my situation, it is very clear that only his administrative staff read it and claimed ""they have to go by the federal credit reporting act or similar"" and that the information is accurate, thus they can't remove it as a goodwill gesture.**

* **Previously in 2017, I tried doing a credit dispute against TFS, which did not work. At this point I'm not sure whether to keep bombarding TFS with reworded Goodwill requests or just give up and wait until 2023.** 

* Out of the many financial problems I've ever had in my 10 year credit history, only TFS (second account) and Confident Financial Solutions account have 30-day markers. The other ones I had with Synchrony on 2 cards (same period of Feb 16), were successfully disputed and removed from all 3 bureaus (although valid).

* I have pointed out to them that for 8.5 months in 2013 I had another account with them before this one which was for my Scion FR-S and paid that account extremely on time (paid due on date). 

* Trading that in for a Tacoma was not something I intended to do in the first place and tried to change my mind last minute (it did not work obviously) upon realizing what the negative equity would cause.

* The dealership convinced me to go home with it for the night (after trying to back out) and then refused to undo the paperwork the next day. I did my best to pay for it over 2.5 years as my primary vehicle, but when I had to keep paying for a stolen car (for sale) that the police deemed a ""civil matter"", I collapsed financially.

* I made very bad choices in assuming I could sell it (Tacoma) for what I owed, AFTER buying another vehicle to replace it BEFORE even selling it off, and then also winding up with 3 vehicles in total I OWED money on for 15.5 to 18 months between October 2014 and April 2016 (bought Focus ST to replace both in 12/2014).

* Considering the circumstances, I'm not sure if I should push on TFS more to do this, as well Confident Financial Solutions (repaired clutch damaged by renter at $2,000) to remove these 30 day markers via goodwill.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the circumstances, I&amp;#39;m not sure if I should push on TFS more to do this, as well Confident Financial Solutions (repaired clutch damaged by renter at $2,000) to remove these 30 day markers via goodwill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot blame anyone for my past mistakes, but I&amp;#39;ve heard about them honoring such requests regarding 60-90 day markers for much more avoidable reasons, compared to 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

We did an approximate check to see how much we could borrow on the Halifax app and it came to around £114,000 which was fine for us.

We have recently viewed 2 houses worth £110,000 and £100,000, well within our price range. It may also be worth mentioning we were planning to do the 5% deposit.

Last night, we applied for a mortgage in principle and was very surprised to see we can only borrow £93,500 which will make affording a £110,000 virtually impossible. My question is, is this accurate?

I have been in my current job for 5 months which I found after completing a Masters at Univeristy. I am currently on £17,500 a year. My GF has been in her job for 4 years and is on £12,800 (30 hour contract) but often does overtime which we mentioned in the mortgage in principle application. 

Before February of this year I had no credit at all so I got a credit card and have been spending a little on that, paying it back in full each month to build up a report. 

My GF has good credit as she pays car payments each month.

My monthly direct debits only add up to £50 whilst my GFs are £300 due to the car.

I guess it's also worth mentioning I have rented in the past, having 3 addresses in the last 3 year's (but since July of last year I have been living with family).

So my question is this: is this figure of 93500 something to take with a hint of salt? We are seeing 2 mortgage advisors on Saturday so hopefully our outlook will look better then. I just don't see why it is so low. How are people ever supposed to become first time buyers when on a joint income of over 30k that's the best we can expect?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend and I have recently began looking at houses to buy.

I have a car, but don't plan on taking it to college.

Insurance is covered by my mom's company

Basically, my expenses are 0 except for fun money, but I don't spend a whole lot anyways.

My money is as follows:

* $500 in a secured credit card (to build credit). I try to keep my spending at under $100 a month on that card. And when I upgrade from secured to unsecured in about 6 months, I'll get my deposit back.

* $1000 in a CD at my credit union that is 5.62% APY. It has a max of $1000, otherwise, I'd put more in it.

* $200 in a checking account with debit card. Just for general purchases, but again, my expenses aren't much.

* $1000 in a low yield savings account with my credit union. Mostly just in case I need to move it to my debit card in an emergency since my credit limit is so low.

* $500 in stocks on Robinhood. I wanted to dip my toe into the market a little bit.

* $1050 in a Roth IRA investment account. It's done pretty well in the last couple of months with initial deposit of $1000. It was the max I could deposit this year since it is the only ""income"" I received.

* $20,000 in a HYSA at an APY of 2.57%. This is really the money that I want to figure out what to do with. Now that I'm a legal adult, I actually can do stuff with it.

* $750 approximately here and there in crypto (I don't need a lecture on how volatile the crypto market is) and other less typical investments that I am working on cashing out.

I don't want my money to just sit around barely accounting for inflation. I get more money every day for stuff that I do, but isn't really income. Considering I don't have rent yet or any debt, it more than covers my cost of fun/life. Therefore, I would like to put my money to work and am okay with both long term and short term investments. I know I should have an emergency fund, so I don't plan on putting all of my money to work, but also what emergencies I could have are pretty limited for the time being. I plan on graduating debt free and with a degree from a good university in mechanical engineering in 2 years, where as I'm sure yall know, I can make bank.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering making an unnecessary purchase and I'm trying to figure out the smartest way to pay for it.  

&amp;#x200B;

The item I'm considering purchasing is \~$2500. I can afford to pay for it outright, but because it's unnecessary I'd rather pay as little as possible for it. The company offers 0% APR for either 12, 24, or 39 months, so I'm thinking about initially investing the total cost of the item and making part of the the minimum payments with the ROI from that investment each month.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I take that $2500 I would have used to purchase the item, and instead invest it in a Vanguard ETF such as VGT. Over the past 3, 5 and 10 years, VGT has an annual return of 26.8%, 18.4%, and 18.6% respectively. With an initial investment of $2500,  this correlates to a monthly return of $55.75, $38.33, and $38.75. The minimum monthly payment with 0% APR is $62/mo. If the trend for the last 10 years continues, I would pay less than half for this purchase. Furthermore, if the market were to crash tomorrow, I would have no problem leaving that initial investment where it is for 5 or more years, as I could also afford to pay $62 out of my checking each month, and leave that initial $2500 invested until its value returned. 

&amp;#x200B;

Considering that this company is offering 0% APR for 39 months, this seems like the best way to pay for it. Worst case scenario I pay the full amount over 39 months and invest $2500 in a high risk ETF a little sooner than initially planned. Best case, this ETF performs well over the next 39 months and I pay a fraction of the total price for this item. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I have no debt other than a mortgage and some student loans. I'm saving \~17% of my salary for retirement split evenly between a 401k and Roth IRA. I have 5 months worth of expenses saved up in an emergency fund, and any extra I have left over at the end of each month goes into an investment account, of which is currently worth \~6 months of my salary. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I correct in my thinking, or is there something I'm missing?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR, Company offers 0% APR, so I want to invest the cost of the item during that period and use the monthly returns to help cover the monthly payments.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Personal Finance,&lt;/p&gt;

I've read a bunch on IRAs over the years, and had a Roth several years ago (had to liquidate thanks to financial troubles, but that's life sometimes). Not an expert of course, but did my due diligence. 


Finally, I'm in a pretty secure job for almost 2 years now (took til 27 but I found it!). I want to start investing for retirement. Here are the facts:


-My company offers a 401K plan, but they do not match

-I make over $74,000 and am single. 

-The 2 points above mean I cannot deduct any Traditional IRA contributions. :(

-I am still within the range to have a Roth IRA (Below $137k, and also below $122k for full contribution)


Question: Does that mean Roth IRA is my only choice, assuming I don't want to contribute to my company's 401K? (I strongly believe I will not be in this tax bracket in retirement, for what it's worth). I've searched times in the past but cannot find anywhere excluding me from a Roth based on income and having an employer 401K plan option.

I  checked again today, and still cannot view a credit report.

Thing is, i don't plan to stick with the company for very long. Should i still take it with thier 'up to 6%' matching?
I also don't have a lot of money, and about $30,000 in debt (student loans, car, credit card) but i would like to invest a little in..somewhere! 

I have a savings account with discover and interested in CDs, stocks and IRAs I just need guidance.

Also I'm looking for some side work to do at home on my days off. Like mturk? Any suggestions would be great.

So before I get blasted about cars being a bad financial investment, I have enough disposable income to warrant the purchase of a fun toy and so I’m investigating the idea of bringing a sports car from the UK into Australia, using it for a year or two, and then re-selling it in Australia. 

Ok, so a bit of context for the situation: 

I am an Australian resident looking to import a car from Europe into Australia. We have a house in central Italy which we’ve owned outright for about 2-3 years now. It’s a known fact that cars are cheaper in Europe than they are in Australia. My plan I’ve thought of is to purchase a car form the UK , hold it in our garage at our Italian house for 12 months, and then import it into Australia so we don’t have to pay import duty.

I’m looking to buy the car second hand, roughly costing around £30-35,000 pounds (roughly $58k AUD). 

I still understand there will be other associates costs including gst and luxury car tax, but I just wanted to gauge the advice more experienced redditors of the sub and see if this is a worthwhile endeavour and if that after a year of use in Australia, I would be able to resell the car at a price probably allowing me to break even on the whole thing.

I want to make extra payments on a student loan with a high interest rate.  Right now, I'm paying about $150/month on this particular loan.  I'm able to put an extra couple of hundred on the loan, but I just want to make sure it's applied properly. Navient updates their website a lot; hence, this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Navient gives you this warning on their site, ""If you make an Overpayment on some or all of your loans, you may advance your next payment due date, which can cause a future Auto Pay payment to be processed as an Overpayment.""

&amp;#x200B;

If you go to your profile, you have some options to adjust this.  I don't understand the following options : Allocation Direction 

*The Allocation Direction allows you to tell us how you would like your Overpayment allocated across your loans. (If you are not the primary borrower, please click the information icon above for additional details.)*

**Highest Interest Rate.** The Overpayment amount will be paid to your loan with the highest interest rate. \[It is currently set at this as the default\]

**Highest Current Balance.** The Overpayment amount will be paid to your loan with the highest Current Balance.

**Lowest Current Balance.** The Overpayment amount will be paid to your loan with the lowest Current Balance.

**Prorate Across Selected Loans.** Prorate means that we will divide the Overpayment across all the loans you’re paying. The calculation is based on the Monthly Payment Amount.

**Unsubsidized and Private.** The Overpayment will be prorated by Monthly Payment Amount across your Unsubsidized and Private loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Under this I have the following: 

*We’ll always apply your Overpayment toward your Current Balance. When you make a payment that is equal to or more than the amount of future monthly payments, do you want to be billed for your full Monthly Payment Amount? (If you are not the primary borrower, please click the information icon above for additional details.)*

Billing Direction.**No, Advance my due date by the number of payments I cover.** Even if you have zero amount due on your billing statement, continuing to make payments will reduce your total cost of borrowing. \[Currently set at this option\]

**Yes, Bill me for my full monthly payment.** You will be required to make a full monthly payment with your next billing statement.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm assuming, I'm going to select the last option...bill for the full monthly payment.  But I don't know if I should adjust the options under overpayment amount.  

&amp;#x200B;

When you go to the Make a Payment option...they give you two options--1. Direct an Overpayment 2. Specify for each loan. I'm assuming to make extra payments, I have to select option 2. But then they have this disclaimer at the bottom when you get to the Specify for Each Loan pop-up. ""**Did You Know?** If you make an Overpayment on some or all of your loans, you may advance your next payment due date, which can cause a future Auto Pay payment to be processed as an Overpayment."" I'm not sure if I should ignore that after I adjust the option in my profile to bill for the full monthly payment.

Therefore, I don't even have an EOB for why it was denied etc. I am upset about how unprofessional this company is. And even if the ambulance company resubmit a claim to the right address, it will be denied because it is far too beyond the 90 day filing window.

My concern is that, what should I do if the ambulance company is going after me for the bill. By the way they have been handling this case, I know they don't care at all how it is going to hurt me financially. I am not entitled to this bill because of their sluggish working style that missed the window for correct filing. But at the same time, I am not so sure how I can fight for my rights.

&amp;#x200B;

College

* My college credits are about to start expiring
* I've been getting low grades, failing classes; I was an ""A"" student prior to working full time
* I’ve found it difficult retaining info when most of my time is spent at work
* Haven’t been able to keep up with homework given workload both job and classes

Career

* Degree will allow me to start my own business
* If I don't start my own business, min 50% raise over current salary
   * Friend who graduated last year is making nearly double my current salary, w/o prior experience
* I have enough years of experience for my Professional Engineer's license, I just need the degree
* Current job does not agree with part time hours, no part timers in company

Finance

* Current salary is $65k/year
* Unsure where to get loans/funding
* Parents are no help financially or otherwise
* I have good credit, will surely go down adding loans 
* Currently have $12k in 0% apr credit card debt (will be paid off by November)
* 401k has approx. $12k, vested; HSA has approx. $6k
* My fiancée has a low paying job (teaching) that covers her living expenses, student loans
* I will have to find loans/part time work to cover living expenses 
   * Approx. $2k/month, includes rent, utilities, food, etc. (inflated estimate)
* I've had my real estate license for 5 years, will consider being more active while going to school full-time
* I'm getting married 1 year from now (already put down deposits)
   * Will need to come up with about $30k
* I’ve avoided loans as long as I possibly could have, but now I’m realizing the opportunity costs were FAR greater than the loans would have cost me had I graduated years earlier

Other

* Interested in joining Air Force to become an officer post-graduation
   * Not an option to enlist now due to weight requirements
* Gained substantial amount of weight, quitting my job will help me lose weight by being able to plan out/cook meals and exercise
* 1st gen college student, has always been my goal to graduate college

&amp;#x200B;

I have thought about quitting my full-time job for well over a year and after the final I took today (and probably failed) I am not interested in “sticking it out” any longer.

I am looking to buy a used car for my senior year in college in the $5,000-$8,000 price range.

AMEX has an auto buying program where the listed dealerships allow a minimum of $2,000 on the AMEX card, up to a maximum of the full amount.

My plan is to make my minimum spend on the AMEX for the sign up bonus and additional points from buying the car itself. In total, this is valued around $1,500 in rewards points that I can use for Spring Break (I've never been on a vacation inside or outside the USA before, so this is a nice perk).

The issue is that AMEX Platinum is a charge card, meaning that I would have to pay off $5,000 at the end of the month. I do not have $5,000 at the moment.

I've never bought a car before, so I need more clarification of how a car loan would work towards this scenario. If I get an auto loan from a bank or credit union would I get a lump sum of money, pay off my AMEX, then continue to pay off the auto loan as normal?

If not, can I do this with a personal loan? The interest would be higher, but I get both a car and vacation out of it. Additionally, I can get the interest reduced to 6% when I commission active duty military in a few months.

I am moving to France, more specifically near Paris to study law for 5 years. Luckily unlike in the US the fee is of 150 euro per year. I have never really struggled for money but my family always taught me to be careful. I intend to study law for 5 years to integrate the police force and later on become a commissioner if things go according to plan which they probably won't.

My father worked as an accountant, had a very good understanding of the market and always gave me quick lessons throughout my childhood, sometimes it was through games, other times it was very detailed. He promised he would help me out when I was finished studying by giving me advice on what insurance to chose, how to pay taxes and more importantly : how to invest in bonds and other devices to get some extra-income.

I'm afraid to say I'm quite naive even though I like to think the contrary, my fear is being poor and making mistakes which will cripple me on the long term. I have the basics imprinted in my soul thanks to my father at least :

\- Never spend more than you can afford

\- Never take a loan you can't pay off with your current means

\- Don't take a loan for something temporary

I think that if I stay level headed I can avoid a few pitfalls and generally stay above poverty but I don't want to stay barely above either. I've always had ambition but I realize that I need to get some good habits right now or I'll always be known as a pitiful loud mouth.

I guess where I really need advice is for the most urgent stuff, should I work during my first year of studying law knowing that it will be a very hard year especially for a first timer.

What should I buy regarding food, I am very frugal and used to content myself of toast with ham without butter but I realize I want to live a healthy life too.

I want to take up boxing as there are quite a few clubs that offer heavy discounts to students near my location which would help me stay healthy as well as take my mind off studying from time to time, will I be able to afford the money/time especially in first year ?

Over the past few years I turned from being a shy, anxious and depressed into somebody who enjoys life and can make friends. I like to attend parties and I would like to attend them from time to time, are there tips to avoid spending too much ?

I will be living at my grandmothers which will avoid costs concerning finding somewhere to live and will be going to University by bike. I am thinking of using the metro for other occasions if it is too far away a location, where I used to live I was quite adept of free-rides by buying a ticket whenever I saw a controller come but in Paris I am certain I will get absolutely fucked if I ever try to pull that off, should I invest in some monthly pay ticket (navigo) and look for a student reduction ? I am not sure whether I will use it too much so I am thinking of going the first month without one to see if simply buying tickets will be cheaper in the long run.

I've posted here in the past but since then my situation has changed (thankfully for the better) and I'm looking for some feedback on the structure of my net-worth (Do I have too much in cash, am I invested too heavily, is there a more well balanced approach, etc). Since graduation I have worked for 3 companies, noted as C1, C2 and C3 for readabilities sake.

**Granular Net-Worth Breakdown:**

Account Type | Amount | Net-worth percent | Notes
-------------|------|-----------|-----
Checking 1 | $16,750 | 5.9% | Legacy account from High School with a reputable bank, used to pay bills.
Checking 2 | $1,000 | &lt; 1% | Used for free international/domestic ATM access
Savings | $43,000 | 15.26% | 2% APY
Stocks/Indexes | $141,000  | 50.06% | 73% Indexes, 27% stocks
RSUs (C2) | $40,000 | 14.23% | -
RSUs (C3) | $0 | 0% | Haven't vested yet.
401k (C1) | $13,000 | 4.62% | -
401k (C2) | $26,200 | 9.3% | -
401k (C3) | $720 | &lt;1% | -
Net-worth | $281,670 | 100% | -

**Aggregate Net-worth Breakdown:**

Account Type | Amount | Net-worth percent
------------|------|-----------------
Cash (Checking/Savings) | $60,750 | 21.57%
Taxable Investments (Stocks/Indexes/RSUs) | $181,000 | 64.26%
401k | $40,000 | 14.2%

**Income**

My compensation is made up of salary and RSUs. I'm paid twice a month, but the RSUs get vested quarterly after my one year cliff. So I factor the RSUs out of my budget, but I mention them since this is a discussion about net worth allocation.

Things that might be noteworthy here:

- Vehicle is paid off (0% @ 36 months, I'm proud of this one)

- Student loans are paid off.

- No credit card debt.

General income overview | Amount
---|------
Monthly 401k contributions | $1500
Cash remaining after bills | $3000

Annually I receive about $125,000 (pre-tax) in RSUs. However, I currently work for a private company so that number is subject to change and the money is not yet liquidable.

**Summary**

If you've read this far, thank you! My income and net worth structure is a little complex. Especially with the future RSUs that I'll be granted my net-worth will be pretty skewed towards RSUs and investments. Given my age, is this okay? Should I have a larger percentage of my net-worth accessible as cash through checking/savings accounts? Should I invest more? Another thing I'd like to mention is that I would like to buy a home in the Bay Area one day (reasons you probably don't care about but I grew up here and think I'd like to stay), so having money that isn't totally locked up is important to me since I could see myself buying in the next 3 - 5 years.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;#39;m a 26 [M], living in the CA Bay Area.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Income&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My compensation is made up of salary and RSUs. I&amp;#39;m paid twice a month, but the RSUs get vested quarterly after my one year cliff. So I factor the RSUs out of my budget, but I mention them since this is a discussion about net worth allocation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that might be noteworthy here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vehicle is paid off (0% @ 36 months, I&amp;#39;m proud of this one)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student loans are paid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No credit card debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;General income overview&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Amount&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Monthly 401k contributions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$1500&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cash remaining after bills&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;$3000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annually I receive about $125,000 (pre-tax) in RSUs. However, I currently work for a private company so that number is subject to change and the money is not yet liquidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve read this far, thank you! My income and net worth structure is a little complex. Especially with the future RSUs that I&amp;#39;ll be granted my net-worth will be pretty skewed towards RSUs and investments. Given my age, is this okay? Should I have a larger percentage of my net-worth accessible as cash through checking/savings accounts? Should I invest more? Another thing I&amp;#39;d like to mention is that I would like to buy a home in the Bay Area one day (reasons you probably don&amp;#39;t care about but I grew up here and think I&amp;#39;d like to stay), so having money that isn&amp;#39;t totally locked up is important to me since I could see myself buying in the next 3 - 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

In a nutshell:

&amp;#x200B;

Best friend since childhood has been horrible with money since we were kids - always spends everything he has no matter how much or little it is, never saves, always ""broke"".  Considers tax refund each year a ""windfall"".

&amp;#x200B;

Best friend's wife is worse than he is.  She spends money that isn't in the bank.  A lot of it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I see a future where their 2 children whom I care quite a bit about will struggle to afford college, but more importantly will struggle to have financial strength as they grow into adults.  

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I want to setup something like a Roth IRA for each of them (though I understand a Roth requires them to have income, which they do not, they are both under 8 years old).  Our goal here is not to fund it indefinitely, but rather to gift each of them with some equal amount, in an effort to show them the magic of compound interest over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

An additional concern I have is I want to ensure its \*very\* difficult to withdraw before they retire.  Mainly because while I trust their parents to abide by our wishes, I can envision a period of time where they feel they have no choice but to withdraw it to pay the mortgage and in their heads promise to pay it back later, because there was a trampoline on sale at Sams 2 weeks ago.  So, I'm looking for something that can give some sort of protection from that?

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding is this is something akin to a Trust, but that seems a lot more complicated than the dollar amounts we're talking (I'm thinking like $100 for each of them to watch grow over time), so it seems like a trust or similar is a bit overkill.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts?  I do intend to ask our tax guy about this once tax season comes around but figured it couldn't hurt to pick reddit's brain too. :)

I have no idea what to do. Here’s a list of our monthly bills.

Rent will go to $400/m and gas and electric down to $100/m. Gas for cars will also go down as we are moving closer to my fiancé’s work. 

Can anyone give me tips on how to make it as young parents who are getting a major pay cut? We make it now but I don’t know that we will soon.

My husband (30M) and I (25F) are expecting our 2nd child and like the idea of getting a bigger (more expensive) car and home to make things more practical for our growing family. Our oldest is 7 years old. We are having a hard time financially agreeing to a plan for this and coming up with a budget for both things. Looking for any advice, if what I am hoping for is even possible. Here is a breakdown of our income and expenses.

**Current financial situation:**

Combined annual income - 92k pretax, but we take home about 5k/month after taxes, retirement, &amp; health insurance

We have a 23k emergency fund in a high-yield savings account, about 8k in a non high-yield savings account, 40k in retirement funds, and 4.5k in other investments. We have $0 in credit card debt.

**Monthly Expenses:**

Mortgage- $900/month, we owe 118k and our home is valued at 190k

Groceries- $550/month

Cell phones- $185/month

Gas- $300/month

Student loans- $550/month, we owe 19k with interest (Will be paid off in approx. 38 months max)

Car payment- $0, we own two cars (2012 Ford Focus with 70k miles and 2010 Ford Fusion with 106k miles). We would like a midsize SUV to make our lives easier. I would roughly estimate that our cars are worth about 4k each.

Car insurance- $170/month for both cars

Average car maintenance- $110/month

Utilities- $280/month

Internet, netflix, etc.- $90/month

College fund for the kids savings- $100/month (I know, it is not much. We just started saving for this 6 months ago, so we only have about $600 saved so far)

Dog- $80/month

We also spend about $2500 in gifts/birthdays/Christmas/graduation parties/ etc. annually- so approx. $185/month

**Total expenses:** $3500/month

We are saving on average $900/month... leaving approximately $600/month on average in miscellaneous expenses (eating out, small home repairs and maintenance, weekend getaways, etc.) We don't have an exact cost breakdown of where this $600/month goes.

We have no monthly expenses for child care. I work only 4 days a month as a Registered Nurse. My income can easily increase by picking up shifts or working more permanently if we needed it too, but we prefer to avoid child care costs and keep the kids at home with me while they are young.

So, where do we go from here? What is our next step? I would like to get a new(er?) mid-size SUV (Should I lease? Buy new? Buy gently used?) and eventually a bigger home within the next year. Is this feasible? I know our expenses will be increasing with the arrival of our 2nd child in November. How can we financially plan for this? What is a reasonable budget for a new home and a new car?

Please be brutally honest. I need some insight other than what my husband tells me. He feels we should stay put at least 2-3 more years to pay off student loan debt and save more. He agrees a new car would be very useful and is possible, but coming up with a budget has been difficult. 

Any and all advice is appreciated.

EDIT: The reason I would like to purchase a new home is because we live in a pretty small home (3 bedrooms, 1 bath) 1000 sq feet. I think we will live more comfortably if we had more room.

My current savings are only $1000. 

Studio apartments here start at around $1000 a month. One bedrooms start at $1150. My parents would co-sign to help me meet the requirements but I would pay entirely on my own.

My job now. I work in a burnt out office. A hate the office, I hate the software my company uses, I hate the things I have to do. I feel like my skills could be better put to use and I feel dumber by the day. The people of the office are okay. I joined the company 9 months ago in promise I will be quickly be promoted and learn a lot. I feel like I have stalled and do not know when I will start to finally learn new things be where I feel like I’m getting paid to do work.

I left my previously company thinking I will learn a lot more but I haven’t. I only learned just a little bit. The only thing though is this job pays me a lot. For being 27 years old, I think I earn a decent income. 

I was able to find a new job closer to home like really close. 4 miles one way rather then a 30-40 minute train ride to a city. I think it does have growth potential. The only downside is the pay. I will get paid a lot less. With my job now, even with commuting costs and city taxes being deducted now, I will still earn a lot more then if I take the new job. 

Is money always worth it? Should I just stay because of the money in hopes that I will advance to where I want to be. The management now is trying but things happen such as supervisor leaves and will delay my growth because a new supervisor will have to be found. I really think they are trying but maybe 4 months ago fine but now I’m just burnt out for the mediocre work I do and if it is good to leave and take less money for better advancement or stay for the money in hopes that I will get advancement (learn more) in the near future. I hate bragging but they paid me a lot because of my experience and I want to learn more but feel like for past 9 months, just a glorified customer service rep.

I feel like I have stalled and do not know when I will start to finally learn new things be where I feel like I’m getting paid to do work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left my previously company thinking I will learn a lot more but I haven’t. I only learned just a little bit. The only thing though is this job pays me a lot. For being 27 years old, I think I earn a decent income. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to find a new job closer to home like really close. 4 miles one way rather then a 30-40 minute train ride to a city. I think it does have growth potential. The only downside is the pay. I will get paid a lot less. With my job now, even with commuting costs and city taxes being deducted now, I will still earn a lot more then if I take the new job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is money always worth it? Should I just stay because of the money in hopes that I will advance to where I want to be. The management now is trying but things happen such as supervisor leaves and will delay my growth because a new supervisor will have to be found. I really think they are trying but maybe 4 months ago fine but now I’m just burnt out for the mediocre work I do and if it is good to leave and take less money for better advancement or stay for the money in hopes that I will get advancement (learn more) in the near future. I hate bragging but they paid me a lot because of my experience and I want to learn more but feel like for past 9 months, just a glorified customer service rep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has thing happened to anyone and is money always worth it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I work in insurance claims&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His parents took out a student loan for him. He did not take out any student loans for the engineering school in Michigan. He took out student loans for schooling at a Wisconsin technical school from 2006-2007 &amp; took out student loans for a technical school in Minnesota from 2014-2017.

In November/ December of 2018 his parents got 3 consecutive letters sent to there home in Wisconsin  from Treasury of Michigan. When we came to visit from Minnesota  for the holidays we were able to open the letters. 

The letters were from collection agency and Treasury of Michigan saying he owes almost $4,000 to the university he went to for only 1 year that he did not take any loans out for.

The account number was his social security number. The dates did not match up. It never showed up on any credit reports between then and when he was first notified almost 13 years later. He was never previously sued, his wages never garnished,his taxes never intercepted. He was never notified until 6 months ago about this. The Wisconsin technical school hounded him right after the grace period. He had his wages garnished until they were paid in full by about 2009. WI school used to be on his credit report until it fell off. MN he applied for forbearance after grace period for 3-6 months initially then applied for an extension through 2020 both were approved. In May of this year he applied for loan consolidation and a payment plan because multiple loans through Nelnet in forebarence were destroying credit.  

When he called MI he talked to at least a dozen people who said to call a diffrent number or talk to a diffrent person who  eventually said it was his debt but with how sketchy it was we just assumed it was a scam and ignored it.

Last Friday we went to get preapproved for a mortgage ( our landlord is selling her property, we were working on credit and saving for down payment) . He has had his credit pulled on 3 occasions prior( not ideal, but life happens) . Last September when we tried to get prequalified for a home but his credit wasnt good enough for an FHA. Last December when we switched banks and this May when we took out an autoloan for a new vehicle. NONE of the previous 3 credit reports showed that he had debt in MI or that he was delinquent on his MN Nelnet Student loans before consolidation.

This most recent credit report did. We thought it had to be an error. Filed a complaint with FTC and local police station. Applying for a 7 year fraud alert and disputing charges at each credit bureau. Contacted Nelnet about the sudden 120+ day delinqient 10+ student loan accounts and told he is in good standing, now writing a letter of good will. Contacting Financial Student Aid omnibuds as well. We noticed that previously on FSA it was just his MN technical school and prior to that the WI technical school never the MI school. Now MI is on the FSA prior/ delinquent loans section and showing details that were never previously there. 

This cannot be legal. The statute of limitations and  validity of the school debt from MI should not affect our credit score or show up in FSA when it wasnt there previously can it?  Nelnet for MN school is notorious for screw ups they dont allow access to messages once opened ( at least for us on  a Computer) and we are having a hard time getting info on the 2 forebarances because the consolidation took over.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your taxable income is the market value of the shares at vesting

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm trying to understand how that fits in with the rest of my finances for the year.  My vesting schedule is such that I have to wait an entire year before receiving any shares, and then each quarter after that 1/4th of that amount will vest for another year.

&amp;#x200B;

That means in 2020, assuming I don't get fired or quit, I'd expect to get:

*(For whatever reason the vesting starts in Feb and not Jan)*

Feb 2020 - 100 shares *(vested from the previous year)*

May 2020 - 25 shares

Aug 2020 - 25 shares 

Nov 2020 - 25 shares 

Feb 2021 - 25 shares 

&amp;#x200B;

If I understand correctly, when I do taxes for 2019, I'll have 0 shares to worry about, then in 2020, I'll have 175 shares to worry about, in 2021 it'll drop down to 25 shares (and 0 shares after that).  I don't know the value of these shares, obviously, but  currently my annual salary is equal to about 100 shares.  

&amp;#x200B;

In other words (I think) it means in 2019 I'm likely to earn X, then in 2020 I'll earn 2.75x, and then in 2021 - 1.25x.  And at 2.75x my usual income, my tax rates will go up considerably.  But under a different vesting schedule, if my math is right, my overall tax burden could be lower.  If I simply received shares every quarter, I'd earn 1.75x, 2x, 1.25x.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is really just to confirm that there isn't anyway to say that 'even though I received this income in 2020, it was earned in 2019 and should be applied to my 2019 earnings' or something similar?  Or if there is anything else I should be/could be doing to minimize my taxable income when I'm expecting a single year of increased earnings that might not already be obvious?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found a lot of sites that say something along the lines of&lt;/p&gt;

When most people think about filing bankruptcy they think about Chapter 7. When it comes to personal bankruptcy, the two most popular and well-known chapters are chapters 7 and 13.

The reason most people think of Chapter 7 when they think of personal bankruptcy is because this is the most common Chapter people use and is well known for their ability to wipe out all unsecured debts with the bankruptcy discharge.

With Chapter 7 there is no repayment, so when an individual gets a bankruptcy discharge, the debt is gone. Over the last few years, many people have used Chapter 7 to eliminate debts that have been caused by lawsuits from deficiencies of unsecured properties.

In this day and age many people have faced foreclosure nationwide and many lenders go after the debtor for the unpaid deficiency.

***There is not one person in America that hasn’t heard about the real estate market meltdown.***

&amp;#x200B;

Since house values have dropped drastically, many folks have been forced to walk from their home because they owed twice as much as it’s worth. But the good news is, filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy will eliminate any liability for the debtor.

In this article we are not here to discuss the benefits of filing Chapter 7, but to show the power of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

Since the financial apocalypse many Americans have been fighting to stay on top of their bills and keep their family home. The lucky ones that are still employed working at a job that pays more than minimum wage, might not need their debts wiped out, but just a little help to get caught up on past mistakes.

When filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy, an individual and their bankruptcy attorney are required to submit to the bankruptcy court a feasible repayment plan that will last 3 to 5 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Once approved, the bankruptcy trustee will be responsible to collect the payments and pay the Fed according to priority with secured debts being paid first and the unsecured will get what’s left over if any.

At the end of the Chapter 13 payment plan if there is anything left unpaid it will be wiped out the bankruptcy discharge.

This allows an individual that has fallen behind on their mortgage or car payments to use the bankruptcy filing to get caught up. Chapter 13 bankruptcy is king when you want to stop foreclosure and get your finances back on track.

Chapter 13 is not for people who are unemployed and cannot afford to maintain the payment plan. This is one reason why Congress enacted the means test, to force people into Chapter 13 that made more money than the median income of their state.

They believed that people could pay back at least a portion of their debt if they had a substantial income. Some Americans would rather file bankruptcy and pay back some of the debt anyways and this chapter allows them to do so.

***Some people believe that Chapter 13 is not as hard on an individual’s credit as Chapter 7 bankruptcy.***

&amp;#x200B;

Showing an attempt to pay back at least a portion of the debts seems to go a long way with creditors. In today’s real estate market with a high number of foreclosures nationwide, Chapter 13 bankruptcy has become a new benefit for Americans that don’t qualify for any kind of loan modification program.

For an individual that has a HELOC that originally was secured by the property but now that the property’s value has dropped there is no value to secure the loan. The bankruptcy attorney can file a motion with the court to used Chapter 13 for lien stripping and include the second in the bankruptcy discharge.

This will allow the person to possibly be able to keep their home if they can continue making the payment on their first mortgage.Chapter 13 has all the same benefits of a Chapter 7 including the automatic stay.

&amp;#x200B;

It might take longer, but with the right bankruptcy attorney and some hard work, the individual will be on the road to becoming debt-free once again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people think about filing bankruptcy they think about Chapter 7.

I have read the general ""what should I do with my money?"". I don't have any retirement account because I don't have a steady job. I also don't have any debt (I am quite lucky). I don't have a job, a spouse, or kids.


I will go to graduate school in the fall. I have an assistantship that will pay tuition but I will pay my own loving expenses, budget of $900 a month. (I will need to take money out of my investment accounts for that.)


Right now my investment account is 127k. On the statement it says the goal is growth. 

It is:

35% us equity large cap,

6% us equity mid cap

4% us equity small cap

19% international developed markets

7% international emerging markets

5% real estate securities

23% fixed income

1% cash alternatives


--My parents started this investment account and I haven't had much to do with it. This is a lot of money to me. I think it started around 80k so it has definitely grown. I only took out money (3k) once.


I would like to treat most of the assetts as for retirement. I want to preserve and grow them for the long-term future.


I would also like to know that I could take out a fair amount of money if I needed, before retirement, though I don't expect to (like 30k or so).


The funds I live off of are in a normal checking account at a credit union, 2k right now (leftover from last job).


I do not trust the financial advisor (northwestern mutual) handling the investment accounts at all. The one time I withdrew money, he encouraged me to withdraw more money than I had planned, then told my mother (according to her) that I was irresponsible for withdrawing money, and he should be in charge of the account as a custodian. Not sure about that phrasing or meaning, anyway, nothing changed except my opinion of him.


Ideally I'd like to have a fee-only advisor but can't find one here. I really would prefer that someone else besides myself handle details. I may just go with the son of my current advisor, who practices where I am moving to. But because I don't trust them I would like advice from here.


It seems that I want to change my goal to conservation and a little growth. What should I ask them to do, or is the current arrangement fairly stable? Should I establish other types of accounts?

It's my first time posting here and I'm in dire need of help. I really don't know what to do with my money. I'm just getting completely overwhelmed with all the different options.


Financial situation:
- I curently have 0 money saved up (just finished paying off tuition)

- I have 4000$ saved in a group RRSP at work with highest risk possible.

- No TFSA/High interest savings account (HIS)

- I should be able to save ~30k in a year.



Goal:
Put a 5% down payment on a house in approximately a 1-2 years. Essentially as soon as I can put a down payment. Houses go for around 500k in my town.


Problem:
I have no idea how to save my money for a short term goal, I assume something with minimal risk. My options are:

1. Dump it all in my group RRSP and then withdraw it with first time home buyer's plan (I don't know all the rules around HBP).

2. Open up a TFSA and save in that (I was thinking index funds but there's probably volatility associated with it).

3. Get a High Interest Saving's account around 2%. But I really don't think that'll save me much.

4. Something I'm not aware of.


Caveats:
Have not looked into any mortaging. I'm assuming 5% will be worth it, compared to 10+% and less interest, as I live in Kanata,Ottawa and the housing market is constantly going up over the last 10 years.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open up a TFSA and save in that (I was thinking index funds but there&amp;#39;s probably volatility associated with it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a High Interest Saving&amp;#39;s account around 2%. But I really don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;ll save me much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something I&amp;#39;m not aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caveats:
Have not looked into any mortaging. I&amp;#39;m assuming 5% will be worth it, compared to 10+% and less interest, as I live in Kanata,Ottawa and the housing market is constantly going up over the last 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;

**Story:**

About a year ago I got demoted from a job that paid nice and was full time. I had three credit cards at the time. After the demotion I took a hit on both hours and pay. Eventually I ended up losing the job and recently found a new one.

In that time I didn't pay any of my three credit cards for about a year and a half. They have maxed out and piled up in interest and two of the accounts I've have either been closed or locked out since I can't get into them. One of the cards sent me a court order for the debt.

**Current Predicament**

In about two weeks Im going to move back in with my parents and take the next year or so to try and fix all this.

My credit is completely shot. I don't have any money, nor a job at the moment since I'm moving back home and owe about **13k**. I Don't know what to do about the court order or how to begin tackling this. I keep looking up these Debt Relief companies but don't necessarily trust them. I also don't want to file for bankruptcy because Im 27 and want to get my life back on track in the next couple years.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the mistake I made but letting it get out of hand but there isn't anything I can do about that at this point so

Is the debt relief the best way to go or does anyone have a better solution....or any kind of solution/advice?

My dad owns a few rental properties (all commercial) except for the house that he has offered to sell to me. It is the house my grandfather bought back in the 70's and my dad lived there for about 20 years so there is some sentimental value.  

Currently the house is valued around $600k, a few years ago my dad took out a credit line to invest into his then struggling  business. He owes about $330k on the house now and rents to a family for around $3500/m (it's worth noting the property is a 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom detached home with 4 car driveway and mother-in-law suite, ideal for subleasing). He has had some bad luck with tenants abusing the property and between his business and his other rentals, he is getting burnt out. He has offered to sell me the property for the remaining balance of the credit line because he wants it to stay in the family. 

I make $70k a year with about $20k in federal student loans left. My biggest expense right now is rent which is costing me $1,500/m. I have modest savings and an emergency fund, but in my city, I wouldn't expect to be able to afford to buy a place for another 5 years or so. My dad has suggested I live in the mother-in-law-suite and rent the upstairs out or vice versa if my roommate decided to come with me to the suburbs. 

I am anxious about this added responsibility but also would be thrilled to stop paying the exorbitantly high rent in my city. I used to balk at the idea of moving to the suburbs but now that I am getting older it seems more attractive. My question is, can I actually afford this?  I'd be responsible for the homeowners insurance, taxes and maintenance of the home.

He owes about $330k on the house now and rents to a family for around $3500/m (it&amp;#39;s worth noting the property is a 5 bedroom, 3 bathroom detached home with 4 car driveway and mother-in-law suite, ideal for subleasing). He has had some bad luck with tenants abusing the property and between his business and his other rentals, he is getting burnt out. He has offered to sell me the property for the remaining balance of the credit line because he wants it to stay in the family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make $70k a year with about $20k in federal student loans left. My biggest expense right now is rent which is costing me $1,500/m. I have modest savings and an emergency fund, but in my city, I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect to be able to afford to buy a place for another 5 years or so. My dad has suggested I live in the mother-in-law-suite and rent the upstairs out or vice versa if my roommate decided to come with me to the suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am anxious about this added responsibility but also would be thrilled to stop paying the exorbitantly high rent in my city. I used to balk at the idea of moving to the suburbs but now that I am getting older it seems more attractive. My question is, can I actually afford this?  I&amp;#39;d be responsible for the homeowners insurance, taxes and maintenance of the home. My dad has said the offer stands if I want to wait a year or two, so if not now, what target should I be aiming for to make this work? I would really like to take this opportunity but I don&amp;#39;t want to get in over my head.&lt;/p&gt;

I've searched the forum and got some questions answered but I still have more:

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone ever seen or used an Allpoint ATM that accepts cash? Their website talks about Allpoint+ but a search on their site doesn't really help find out which, if any, ATM's accept cash.

&amp;#x200B;

Discover also uses MoneyPass ATM's and a search there showed that those do accept cash deposits. For those that regularly deposit cash at these ATM's, what is the experience like? Any limitations on how much you can deposit at once? How many bills it accepts at once? How fast are the ATM's? I ask this because some Chase cash deposit ATM's are very slow. If you've encountered any problems with a cash deposit not being accepted or a transaction error, how easy was it to resolve? I've had a few Chase cash deposit errors (very frustrating) and they were resolved fairly easily and simply.

&amp;#x200B;

How long do cash deposits pend at either bank? I'd prefer the cash to be immediately available after deposit.

&amp;#x200B;

I read a comment here from someone saying that they can transfer funds between their Ally checking and savings account but can this also be done with Discover and if so, how quickly is it? Do funds transfer instantly between accounts and available immediately (savings to checking)?

&amp;#x200B;

How long do incoming ACH transfers take? Transfers initiated from Capital One 360 seem to take a whole week from start to funds being available while transfers initiated from an external bank TO Capital One 360 seem to take less time.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it easy to add external accounts?

&amp;#x200B;

Are the routing and account numbers fully and easily viewable online?

&amp;#x200B;

Are the desktop and mobile versions of the sites fast or slow? Are the apps easy to use and fast?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also I have a $600 hydro bill in collections and making payments of $60 a month and 2 more for $300 each going into collections as well soon. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a car loan of $13 000 with a 5.99% interest rate and pay $232 monthly.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm not too knowledgeable on finance (quite obviously) I was wondering if consolidation is my best option? I really need to find the best way to pay these down so I can get out of my hole. If it helps I can leave my current income.

I net $2000 a month after taxes and pay $500 for rent, $125 insurance, $232 car payment, $300 groceries/gas, and cell phone $50.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just curious as to what the best way to deal with it would be. If it helps I&amp;#39;m in Canada just in case things work differently in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel I should check my credit to see if it was checked as part of the purchase process, but wasn’t able to find the link and frankly don’t trust google to find the correct website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerning my my mother and father in law, neither can be trusted and live out of state (same state as the purchase, but different than where I live). I wouldn’t put this past them and certainly don’t expect honesty when confronted. They’ve always been terrible and dishonest when it comes to money. I’m trying to do my due diligence before I confront them. Any direction or advice would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

\- I'd like something pretty safe, but that would give a better return than just sitting in a regular savings account.

My questions: 

\- Based on sub sidebar, I am leaning toward an index fund like S&amp;P 500 or VTI. Is there a preference for one vs the other? Or any other recommendation? a HYSA account?

&lt;p&gt;Why would the medical field be any different?  Except I’ve never heard of this happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also think if a bill is paid, 90 days pass (e. g. A recovery period after surgery) and conditions did not improve you could contest it through the card.&lt;/p&gt;

I also work in the city, approximately 1:15-1:30 by train away from my house. I'm currently making 65k/year and renting an apartment thats \~20 min walk from work for \~$900/month including all utilities. My lease is about to be up and one of my roommates is moving out, so my rent will go up to $1200/month. Honestly, I can easily afford it, but I was doing the math and realized that if I move back home, I can use that money as a loan payment each month and be done with my loans in 3 years, saving myself \~$10k.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been living in this apartment for about 5 months now (short term lease) and I was commuting to work from my house for the first half of my first year at work; it sucked SO MUCH. I was waking up at 5am to make it in to work by 7:30am, there were never any seats on the train due to the high volume of commuters, and I'd have to transfer trains 3 to 4 times. I'd come home late and exhausted and I would never be getting enough sleep, which led to both my work and social life suffering a little. Not to mention the cost of the train tickets was about $400/month and it's gone up since I moved.

&amp;#x200B;

Living so close to work means I get those 3 hours of my life sitting on the train everyday back, which is huge to me. It also means I don't have to live with my parents, which was a really tough adjustment after a great 4 years of college with awesome roommates. However, being able to pay off my student loans in such a short amount of time (about 2-3 years) and using that freedom to travel and do whatever I want is also a big deal. Does it make a lot of financial sense to make this tradeoff?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Wow thanks for the helpful suggestions guys! To answer a few questions 

1. My rent is actually $2400 split b/w 3 people. It's a NYC apartment so this actually considered cheap here. One roommate is moving out, the other is renewing and is in different towards having 1, 2 or 0 roommates (rich parents). We will likely be getting a third roommate, I just mentioned using this new sum of money as if we were splitting the apartment two ways as my potential debt payment because when I initially saw it I thought ""surprisingly, I can actually afford that.""
2. My commute wound up being 1.25-1.5 hours each way because I had to transfer trains 3 to 4 times in the morning in order to get to my office. NYC is laid out kinda weird and if your office is in Queens or Brooklyn and not Manhattan, commuting can be a fucking nightmare. My days were essentially; wake up at 5am, get home by 7pm, and you have 3 hours to do basic human stuff like eat and exercise before you have to go to bed. Not much time for anything non-essential.
3. Cost of commuting was no joke. I was spending $300/month on the railroad ticket, $121 on my metrocard, and \~$100 on gas to get to the train station in an old beater car. So it is something to consider that I forgot; if I moved home, I'd actually be saving a net $300 due to travel. This isn't super cut and dry though, because living at home means that my food costs go down by a TON (literally only paying for lunch, parents stock the house and Mom likes cooking) so I'd probably actually be saving \~$600/month.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I graduated college last year with about 80k in cumulative debt between financial aid and private loans.

I know I am in a bit of a tough spot financially so I'm really trying to learn as much as I can and would love recommendations and advice from others. 

So I went to a private university, I got a bachelor's in molecular biology and Biochemistry and a masters in Biotechnology, and now have a great job. Sadly great job doesn't equal big $$. I'm making 44k a year. I have approximately 80K in student loan debt (68K in federal loans varies from 3.7% to 7.6% interest, 18K in private loans at 6.2% interest). I plan on refinancing some of my loans to get some of the larger interest loans down from 7/6%. Any advice on good refinancing options or what to watch out for? 

I'm hoping to pursue a PhD in about 2 years, which on average makes about 32K in my area a year, (while in the PhD program) so I'd like to save up a little before then.

I'm wondering what would be my best strategy now. At this job should I contribute to a 401K? There is no match until I work here for two years, so I am thinking about just getting the money to start saving for an emergency fund, then to start paying off these loans. However, coming from a family where my parents have practically no 401K and are close to retirement age is certainly a bit stressful to think about. 

If I should consider a 401K I'm a bit confused what I should choose, it gives me the option of Fidelity or TIAA? I've tried understanding it in simple terms but honestly don't know where to begin so any advice in that area would also be helpful. 

Some other background: I can't live at home so I live in an apartment that I split with roommates. With utilities it gets me to about $850 a month. I have a second job that makes $13/hr that I do nights and weekends occasionally. No car, free transportation to work. No other debt.

I have no credit history and I just opened a few months ago a secured card with a 500$ limit. The only use of this card for me is to build a good credit history for 6 months, before I can apply to ""regular"" credit cards and continue building a good credit history, eventually to be able to get good mortgage rates for some real estate business in the USA in 2-3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think of this at the time, but apparently the amount of money you use (credit utilization) is taken into account in your score (even though I don't understand how, especially how is it calculated over time).

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, here's my question. Should I pay off my credit card immediately each time I make a purchase (it's easy to get a 50% utilization, when you only have a 500$ limit)? But then, I would have 0% utilization the day my statement is sent to the credit company? Is this ok? What's the difference if I was simply not using my credit card?

Or should I pay most of it and keep my utilization at 1%? or 10%? But if I keep it at 10% by the time I receive my monthly statement, it means that I will pay interest on the amount owed. And I don't want to pay money to build my credit history.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I go about this?

My rent at the moment is significantly low (500 with utilities) and I just payed off all of my student loans and car loan. I basically have no debt and have around 100k from a house I inherited and sold. My father says I need a more secure job before getting a house but I’m not sure what he means by that. I work in human services/social work currently. 

The housing market in Colorado is not the best for buyers. I’ve heard a lot about the housing bubble bursting in the next couple of years but you never know when it comes to these things. I would like to live buy a house in preferably Denver but I wouldn’t mind living in the greater Denver area if I had too.

The thing is, you basically get a pos shack in Denver for over 300k these days. Even in the outskirts of the city, houses are in the low 3’s. These are areas like Aurora and Green Valley Ranch which is about a 40 min commute into Downtown Denver.

Should I hold out for a while? Should I pull the trigger on a house now? I’m afraid home in the low 3’s will be in the low 2’a soon due to the high cost of living here and marijuana becoming legal all over the country lately. I don’t want to end up upside down or u see water because I wasn’t patient but some say the housing market here will be around what it is consistently.

Does 100k down on a house around 300k make much of a difference? With utilities, taxes, insurance, I’m afraid if anything happened I wouldn’t be able to maintain the payments myself. It’s pretty easy to rent rooms out here but I don’t want to count on that in case the fit hits the shan and I don’t have any tenants suddenly one day. I do know I want to be in Denver long term, I’m working in looking for a better paying job but I may need to gain some credentials before doing so. I have a bs criminal justice degree but have always been able to land decent jobs in the 40k range, any suggestions?

Thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m 28 pulling in 40k annually. My rent at the moment is significantly low (500 with utilities) and I just payed off all of my student loans and car loan. I basically have no debt and have around 100k from a house I inherited and sold. My father says I need a more secure job before getting a house but I’m not sure what he means by that. I work in human services/social work currently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The housing market in Colorado is not the best for buyers. I’ve heard a lot about the housing bubble bursting in the next couple of years but you never know when it comes to these things. I would like to live buy a house in preferably Denver but I wouldn’t mind living in the greater Denver area if I had too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, you basically get a pos shack in Denver for over 300k these days. Even in the outskirts of the city, houses are in the low 3’s. These are areas like Aurora and Green Valley Ranch which is about a 40 min commute into Downtown Denver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I hold out for a while? Should I pull the trigger on a house now? I’m afraid home in the low 3’s will be in the low 2’a soon due to the high cost of living here and marijuana becoming legal all over the country lately.

&amp;#x200B;

I work FT making about $46K yearly salary. Every year I take the standard deduction, file as single, no dependents, and I pay student loans so I get to put that interest on my taxes. I don't own property or my own business or anything complex. 

&amp;#x200B;

This year due to extra bills and trying to pay things off faster, I started working in my free time for Instacart. This is in addition to my full time job. Instacart doesn't take out any taxes as you go, they just give you whatever money you earn weekly. I've looked on the InstacartShoppers subreddit and tried to do some research, but most advice I've seen is geared towards people doing IC as their only job, which makes them ""self-employed"" and they say to prepare for paying 25-30% of your income in taxes, and to keep track of all your mileage and phone bills (since you use your phone) and count those as deductions when you do your taxes. I also know if you're self-employed you're supposed to do quarterly tax estimates, but since I have a FT job on top of IC I was told I don't need to do that, and I haven't because I was having a hard time figuring out how, and I thought I would save myself the trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I have a regular job where I pay state and federal taxes, I'm not sure what amount or % of taxes I should expect to pay. I think with the amount of IC I do, I'll still be better off taking the standard deduction instead of itemizing, since I heard the standard deduction is going to be upped to $12K. I do also pay some medical bills every month, but that total per month is around $70, and I don't think with IC mileage or phone bills it would go over the $12K standard deduction, unless I'm missing something. 

&amp;#x200B;

At my regular job, I currently have $20 withheld from every paycheck, with 26 paychecks a year, which is $520 withheld for the whole year. I also add $300 to my savings every month, which is more than 30% of what I make with IC /month, so I will be able to pay whatever I owe to taxes at the end of the year, I'm just wondering if anyone has a good way for me to calculate what that might be, or if they see any flaws in how I'm doing things, or if there's a way to do them better/more efficiently that could save money?

Some time ago I received a prize from a data analytics competition on Kaggle. The payment was made through Payoneer and some time later they asked me (through email) to submit my tax details through a W form. I don't know which form to choose.

Some information:

- I'm a Brazilian citizen that lives in Brazil
- The form options that are available through Payoneer are W9, W8 ECI and W8 BEN (there is also W8 BENE, but this is under Entity forms)
- There is a wizard to help choose the form. I'm stuck with this question:

  &gt; Is your income a U.S. source income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States? (Yes/No)

As an aside, Payoneer sent me the email asking for tax details at the beginning of March. Could this delay in filling the form bring me any problems?

I’ve just made a down payment for a 960k apartment, and I’m seeking your advise to decide what’s next.

My story starts three years ago. I used to go to college in the US, however I’m not a US citizen, nor am I in the US anymore. After graduation, I moved back home and got a job immediately, that pays 250k/year . At that point of time i had very minimal financial commitments. It’s important to mention that I managed finished college with zero students loan. In addition, I moved back to my parents’ house, which is the norm where I’m from.  And my employer paid for full Health insurance coverage, so I didn’t have any expenses related to the either.

Financially, I was in a really good place. However I decided to blow my money on living a luxurious lifestyle. The first  year, my savings account was almost non existent. Then I realized that I needed to act more responsible and start saving. At the moment I have 340k in saving, which I decided to utilize to buy this amazing apartment.


Which I decided to finance as follows:
340k savings that I used entirely, 
620k as a personal loan with 1.5% interest rate for 5 years 


The loan is going to consume almost 50% of my annual income for 5 year, which I can tolerate by being on a very tight budget. Since I’m not yet married nor have kids, i don’t really need to move to such a big place. I’m conflicted on whether should I move to the new place, which I’d very much like, rent it out fo generate extra income. Someone has already offered me 100k/yr to rent the entire place. 

I know probably it would be a wise decision to rent, however I don’t know why I can’t get my self to do it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! I’ve just made a down payment for a 960k apartment, and I’m seeking your advise to decide what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;

my situation is NOT ""financial advisor told me to pay 60/30"" my situation is my credit sucks even though I've been doing everything right.  And I'm trying to figure out what to do. These financial advisors have been either from my university or froms banks.


I have been working for years to get my credit up and nothing I do seems to help it go up! I'm 27 years old, I would like to buy a condo/townhouse that's $70k and I don't qualify for any loans because my credit is low.

&amp;#x200B;

My junior year of college they cut my program and I lost my scholarship because of it and I had to take a student loan out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for my first credit card at 20 and was denied. I was told to get a secured card so I did. $200 down. Never missed a payment. Used just for gas. Credit never went up. Finally bought a shitty car in my name because a financial counselor told me it would help my credit just having my name on a title. Never went up. Then I noticed my credit went from about 568 to 480 (numbers not exact) because apparently I had a collection for $50 never paid, 6-7 years prior. I didn't know about it, turns out they kept sending it to my mom's house (across the country) and my mom kept throwing it away. It was an extra bill that they had to wait for insurance on. I thought it was all paid, even when I spoke to billing but it was considered 3rd party so I didn't know. Tried to pay it. Couldn't find the company anywhere. 6 months later it went off my credit report but my score stayed low. 

I bought a car out of desperate need and was only approved by one loan company. The car was $6k and the loan had horrible interests rates. 6 months later, I refinanced and interest and my payments cut in half. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been renting for 5 years, never missed a bill. A little over a year ago I finally was qualified for a good credit card, (capital one). $300 limit, then raised to $500. Finance adviser said to spend 60% of limit and every month pay off 30%. And then I find out my credit score is the same. Then told to pay in full every month so have been doing that for a year.

&amp;#x200B;

I still have some student loans but never missed a payment. Did a full analysis credit report and it said my credit was low because of ""young credit"". I've read the Dave Ramsey books. I've done all I can think of. I get my score updates from credit karma. I thought my score would be 600 now. I started my plan 5 years ago and it's still at 488! What can I do?!

I've settled pretty well into my new role and feel very comfortable that I know (mostly) what I'm doing, but I'd estimate I spend 30-40% of my time back at Sara's desk going back over things she should have learned months ago.  Bob spends a lot of time coaching her, too.  It's a minor annoyance to me, but I can tell extremely frustrating to Bob.

Bob is due to retire at the end of 2020 (although I will note that date has been pushed back a few times already, and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets pushed back again...he loves his job and is invaluable to the company.  He'll stay for the right price.)

I had mentioned offhand in a whiny moment to a coworker that it would be quicker and easier for me just to do the old assistant job in addition to my current job, instead of spending all my time painfully walking her through the same steps over and over again.  Well, apparently coworker liked the idea (she's 2nd to Bob) and mentioned it to him when he was expressing frustration about Sarah in one of their one-on-ones.  He apparently was excited about the idea too, and has asked to meet with me on Monday to discuss it (Sarah will be gone on vacation).

So I've got the long weekend to think about what I want to ask for.  I don't want to ask for too much, or I might price myself out of this opportunity, but I also don't want to short-change myself.  And I also need to consider what I'll be sacrificing - my current position offers a lot of flexibility as far as hours, working from home, etc.  As a single working mom that's hard to put a price on, and the assistant job is tied to the desk a lot more.   Also I need to keep in mind that it will probably be a temporary arrangement, lasting only until Bob retires.

Since I used to be in that position and helped with the hiring process, I know what Sarah earns.  I figure even if I ask for her full salary on top of my current salary, the company is still saving on benefits.  But that's probably too much to ask for, right?  I just have no idea.  Do I ask for 50%? 80%?  What say you, Reddit?  What am I not thinking of?

On a personal, possibly irrelevant note: please don't think I don't feel guilty about Sarah.  If I had known my offhand comment would get back to Bob I never would have made it...I'm not looking to get anyone fired.  I also think she's unhappy in the job...she's constantly stressed out and I honestly think she'll be happier in a different position.  And finally, I have to consider Bob.  He's been an excellent boss and mentor to me, and has given me lots of opportunities for advancement and growth.  He could have kept me as his assistant until his retirement, but he promoted me and made me secure within the company, and sacrificed his own convenience and productivity to do it.  So I kind of feel like if this will help him (I know it will), I owe him that.

Long story short, my brother and father haven't paid the house mortgage for the last 12+ months and as a result we have around 16k in arrears. 

There is around 150k remaining on the mortgage, plus 16k arrears and the monthly payment is £1200 which is way too high for us. 

Due to her terrible payment history and credit, I've been told a remortgage is impossible. The bank we are with haven't been able to reduce the monthly payment or extend the term at all as well. Plus as I am only 23 on a basic salary, I cant just get a mortgage myself. 

I could try pay off the 16k arrears and just work two jobs.

As I'm sure the loans company would charge us an arm and a leg for payment outside the period.

I have not had a car insurance since 2014 (didn't have a car), when I was under my parent's insurance. My parents live in Colorado. When I visit Colorado, I just drive their car. They have All State insurance and was told that I am allowed to drive their car for short durations.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now looking into purchasing a car and insurance in August. I will purchase the car in Colorado, where my parent's live because the specific area they live in has very low sales taxes, and my dad will help me look for a car. I will take the car with me when I go back to Michigan in September. I will be graduating in under a year, and I won't remain in Michigan afterwards. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking at a few different scenarios to save on car insurance costs:

(1) Having my dad purchasing the car so that it is registered to his name, or perhaps co-purchasing the car so it's registered to both of our names. And then adding the car and myself to his Colorado insurance plan. Basically, I would just like to be under his insurance plan because it is much cheaper. 

&amp;#x200B;

(2) Registering the car under my name only and purchasing my own insurance. I think I'd have to purchase Michigan insurance, which I want to avoid due to the exorbitant price.

&amp;#x200B;

(1) seems like it would be the cheapest option for me, but is it legal? Would I have any issues with coverage if I got into an accident in Michigan?

My coworkers have been saying that if it's the catalytic converter that failed, the cost would be more than my car worth, and I might be better off buying a car, since it's in my plan anyway.

This leaves us with 1300 ""disposable"", which isn't disposable because whatever is left goes to credit card debt. We met with a mortgage broker and we need the truck loan paid in full in order to debt to service for a 450k mortgage. We have a lot of other debts I would like to be rid of before buying a house. I feel like we are nowhere near ready, but my fiance really wants a house and is happy to get rid of the truck in order to do so. I think we need to get rid of the truck and pay off our debts with the money we are saving on the payment and insurance before we do anything. 

Here are our current debts 

Scotiabank Visa $9500
Capital One         $3200
Canadian Tire     $4300
TD Loan               $30k (van)
Ford Credit          $48k (truck)
Apprenticeship   $2500 
Brick/Desjardins $1700
Ring                     $800 (I think) 

I need to tackle this, but need advice on how. The highest interest rate is on the Scotia bank Visa @19% 

I want to sell the truck, but dont have a clue how when we owe more than it's worth. How do I do this? Would it be smart to take out a loan for $8000 and sell it? This hurts a bit to think about. We can definitely survive with one vehicle. 

I assume for the credit card debt we make minimum payments on them while paying off the highest interest rate card first and then the next one from there. Is that the best way to go about it? 

I truly wish we could put all if this debt together and pay one payment monthly, but I believe that looks like a bankruptcy on our credit report? We have good credit right now, so I dont want to do anything to jeopardize it or that new house in the far future won't be an option. 

Any advice to correct out current situation is hugely appreciated.

i'm a recent graduate who just started work (oil and gas engineer) about a month ago in Houston. turning 23 in a month so lets say i'm 23.

INCOME

base- 100k/yr

sign on bonus- 9k (already put in robinhood in VOO)

end of year bonus- 10-12k/yr

EXPENSES

rent - 1000/month plus utilities

food/alcohol/misc - 12-1500/month

&amp;#x200B;

SAVINGS PLAN (from income)

currently have 22k savings (previous internships/sign on bonus)

401k- 19k/yr (max)

roth IRA- 6k/yr (max)

discounted stock purchase plan- 7k/yr (max)

&amp;#x200B;

after taxes and including rent/monthly spending, I will have \~32k/yr saved in 401k/roth/dspp.

this leaves me with around 18k extra per year in my bank account. i'm wondering if its necessary to save this additional 18k for retirement. my other option would be to use this for travel, new car, other life upgrades, or saving for a down payment on a home.

please let me know if I should alter any of my current investment decisions. thanks everyone!

EDIT: my main concern is what to do with the remaining 18k. I would rather buy nice things/upgrade my life than have an overkill amount in retirement savings, if that makes sense. however, i'm unsure if the 32k/yr I'm currently investing is enough to put me in a great spot once I retire.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

I’m currently in school for a masters (part time) that costs about 4K per semester.  I am not taking out loans to pay for this since I work full time and can afford to pay cash at the beginning of each semester (5 left ~20k).

Fast forward a few weeks, and I got a notice from the IRS that I needed to file a 2014 tax return before I would be able to get my refund. In hindsight, I think they did this because another company claimed that they payed me income for that year. I responded to this notice with a certified letter, stating that I did not need to file a return for 2014 because I was a dependent and had no income for that year (I was a student that year).

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, I received a notice from the IRS stating that I need to file a tax return by July 25th, or else have additional fees (this is also when I saw that I had somewhere around $1250 in fees due already, due to failure-to-file, failure-to-pay and interest). It also said that I never responded to the first notice, even though I did. Part of this notice was listing who said that they paid me income. A company based in Dallas (I live in Oklahoma) claimed that they paid me exactly $25,000 that year. I have never heard of this company until today. That company is described as a broker-dealer, whatever that means. The tax on that plus fees amounts to about $3000.

My fiance and I were beginning to save for retirement and we were hoping to get some input from the fine people here at personal finance. Here is a general background of our situation.   


We have very low costs because my fiance's grandparents left her their house when they passed, and her parents have already given her their house for safekeeping in their older age. We are both 34 years old and childfree. We have only recently started saving up for retirement. She is debt free and has a Roth IRA, a 403 b, a small investment in cryptocurrency and a brokerage account with Vanguard and we both have a teacher's pension that is growing. I am a little bit behind the 8 ball when it comes to saving for retirement because I have spent the last year tackling my debt (Car loan and undergraduate debt) and paying for graduate school. I will be completely debt free in December and have a master's degree debt free next May. However, I do not have any retirement savings short of the teacher's pension.   


The rental market in our area seems to be very strong, and I was considering becoming a landlord so I can retire in 20 years. My goal is to own at least 5 rental properties over the next 20 years so we can be stable financially through the end of our lives.   


A few questions   
1) Does it make financial sense to invest my money into rental properties as opposed to a mutual fund, retirement fund, or a brokerage account?   


2) I can cover a mortgage on a rental property with my job alone, I do not need to use the rental money to subsidize the cost of the home. I understand that some of the rental money needs to stay more liquid to cover the cost of anything that comes up. But my question is this. Should I invest a portion of the rent collected into some sort of fund, such as my fiance's brokerage account? Or should I reinvest that money back into the mortgage so I can get it paid off quickly so I can buy another rental property?   


P.S. We will be signing a prenup prior to our wedding in order to ensure that all of our assets are properly and fairly accounted for, no worries on that front. She is the one with the assets at this point, all I bring to the table is my handsome smile.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Reddit,   &lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;d like some advice for how high I can set my expectations, and how to use my previous salary to leverage a higher pay at the new position. Thanks in advance for the help!&lt;/p&gt;

90% of the items are never worn (some of them even have the tags still), and the other 10% has been worn 1-10 times and in great condition. All of the clothing has been purchased in the last 5 years from H&amp;M and Forever21, and it is male clothing.

I am 26 years old and I new the basics of how to nurture your credit score from my parents at 18, but I never learned anything more than that. I live and die by autopay and unfortunately I recently got hit hard because I was silly, took out a store card (which I knew was a bad idea, I just wanted the rewards for using it at that store). Unfortunately this card did not have autopay available; I made it a couple years before fucking up but naturally I did and missed a payment (this was at the beginning of the year).

Result was my score went from 804 -&gt; 706. I saw this and said fuck no, called the company and told them my card was done because they are not the sort of company that can rationalize being unable to support autopay in 2019. I should have stopped there, but I was frustrated and annoyed and subsequently cancelled one of my oldest accounts, with a reasonable limit, just because I almost never used it. Now that I know slightly more about credit scores I know that to be the worst move I could have made.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt;: Missed a payment because a card didn&amp;#39;t have autopay available.

I am a public HS teacher with a little debt I want to pay off as fast as possible. I'm asking for a budget critique and any further advice I can get to pay off my debt while also balancing an upcoming education expense. 

For background, I graduated in 2018 with an English degree and decided I wanted to go into teaching. Since I don't have my pedagogy/education degree (only content degree in English) I am on a special license that is good for 3 years if I provide proof I am working on my education certificate. My license will expire July 2021. I withdrew from a public university this spring and opted to wait a little bit before starting a fully online program where I will also get my masters in education in addition to my teaching credential (Western Governors University). The masters will be completed by 2021 and will get me a $1300/yr pay increase.

Anyway, here goes:

$37,000/yr pre-tax income paid bi-weekly. I take home about 2250/mo after taxes and minimal retirement contributions only to get my school corporations 2% match

**Expenses:**

$640/mo rent (includes gas and water/sewage) 

$150/mo groceries

$120/mo gas/transportation

$115/mo car insurance and phone bill (combined because I pay my parents directly as I'm on their plans)

$100/mo fun money/entertainment

$73/mo charitable giving

$60/mo average electric bill (lower in the summer higher in winter)

**Total expenses: $1258**

This leaves roughly $992 over each month.

I have $8900 in CC debt which I cleared with a personal loan at 24% APR which was a bone headed move, but I needed to get rid of the CC's and get my spending under control which I have. The personal loan APR is similar to the APR on the CC's, though. 

I also have $1000 in savings.

My question is how do I balance by upcoming education expense of $4,000 while also paying off my loan? I intend to make payments on the 4k as my school will alow. Minimum payment on the loan is $290/mo.

Any thoughts/advice? I have taken many measures to reduce my expenses which included getting rid of streaming services and home internet (I just use cellular data as a hotspot when I need internet).

Obviously I want to pay off the loan asap, but I also need to get my education certificate before 2021 which will cost 4k.

Thanks for any input!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

But why? What difference does it make whether I'm taxed now with an IRA or if I'm taxed at retirement with a 401k?

Maybe a bit of additional information will allow someone to direct me/inform me on my best course.

Currently 33 years old. House is due to be paid off by 48 (15 year refinanced loan) but might be a year or two before that.

Roughly $22k in my 401k. I'm contributing 10% with a 2% match by my company (and the also eat the fees). Currently distributed between a Voya Index 2045 Fund (70%) and the MFS Growth Fund (30%). Year to date return is currently 15.96%

With that said, what would be the reasoning to now contribute to an IRA? Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve read through the retirement Wiki and admittedly I&amp;#39;m still confused on the point of an IRA if I have a good 401k plan. I see folks constantly stating to do company match on your 401k and then put the rest into an IRA of some sort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why? What difference does it make whether I&amp;#39;m taxed now with an IRA or if I&amp;#39;m taxed at retirement with a 401k?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe a bit of additional information will allow someone to direct me/inform me on my best course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently 33 years old. House is due to be paid off by 48 (15 year refinanced loan) but might be a year or two before that.&lt;/p&gt;

I am in Georgia.

I have a 2000 Nissan Xterra in storage, that I don't have the title for. It's in the name of my Mom who died last August. I've been paying $100 a month in storage costs for the last 3-4 months. The tags expired in February. Gave the existing title to the tag office in June, but because I changed address, the new title was lost in the mail. Tried to get it on hold at the Post Office, but it did not arrive.

I am currently financing a 2014 car, and behind on the payments. 3-4 months behind at this point, and still have not found a new job. Lost my online business, owe money, am broke. Had some sort of mental break after the death of my Mom, last August.

I don't have any more money for this month's July storage costs. I do not want to give up a car that I paid for, struggled for, put tires on, and paid for all the repairs on for years, but it is also nearly two decades old.

Quick backstory:

&gt;!Car belongs to my deceased mother. Tragic backstory of severe abuse and financial sabotage with a parent with Borderline Personality Disorder. Didn't realize the extinct of her mental illness until it was too late. Took care of my mother when she got terminally ill, for 2.5 years. She had late stage cancer, and was in denial about being sick. Worked online, so I could take her to all her chemos, radiations, and surgeries like a sucker, sabotaging my career. She repaid me, of course. --------------------------After she came out of her last ostomy surgery, she had some sort of mental health episode, backstabbed me severely, and financially screwed me over epically in a way that messed up my business and left me scrambling. We shared that car, I bought it and paid all expenses and repairs, until she claimed it was only hers. As she started dying, she refused to put it in my name and tried to wreck the car or destroy it. After she screwed me, I paid costs on her home that she couldn't afford and let her live with me for some months until she died in hospice. -------------------------------When she finally passed away last August, I had some sort of mental break, and trying to keep a stable job has been very difficult. -------------------------In late June, I was really close to landing a 60K job, but was told that I didn't seem ""excited enough"" for the role. So close....and I probably wasn't excited, still despondent. -----------------------------The car is a huge trigger for me because of the struggle over it/that it reminds me of my Mom, but I fear being left without any car at all in a city that demands one. That car was the ""best"" one Me, my mom and siblings had ever owned that actually ran well. Cars were always used to control/manipulate/the use restricted by my Dad, and every car ""we"" ever had I purchased myself. I have been carless before, and in the heat it feels pretty close to death. &gt;!

Should I, just junk the 2000 Nissan which is running, but doesn't have tag/titles in my name? 

When I called the junker, they only offered $150 - $200 for it, and it's a running car.

My credit is ruined from a failed business, so I won't be able to finance a car any time soon. It's also hard to find a good used car and it would take me a while to get up enough cash to buy one. Finding a job without a car is nearly impossible here, and the other car could be repossessed. 

I can't do Uber/ridesharing type gigs, have tried but I have severe PTSD/dissociation, and don't want to endanger anyone else.

Any Suggestions?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a 2000 Nissan Xterra in storage, that I don&amp;#39;t have the title for. It&amp;#39;s in the name of my Mom who died last August. I&amp;#39;ve been paying $100 a month in storage costs for the last 3-4 months. The tags expired in February. Gave the existing title to the tag office in June, but because I changed address, the new title was lost in the mail. Tried to get it on hold at the Post Office, but it did not arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently financing a 2014 car, and behind on the payments. 3-4 months behind at this point, and still have not found a new job. Lost my online business, owe money, am broke. Had some sort of mental break after the death of my Mom, last August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have any more money for this month&amp;#39;s July storage costs. I do not want to give up a car that I paid for, struggled for, put tires on, and paid for all the repairs on for years, but it is also nearly two decades old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick backstory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car belongs to my deceased mother. Tragic backstory of severe abuse and financial sabotage with a parent with Borderline Personality Disorder. Didn&amp;#39;t realize the extinct of her mental illness until it was too late. Took care of my mother when she got terminally ill, for 2.5 years. She had late stage cancer, and was in denial about being sick. Worked online, so I could take her to all her chemos, radiations, and surgeries like a sucker, sabotaging my career. She repaid me, of course. --------------------------After she came out of her last ostomy surgery, she had some sort of mental health episode, backstabbed me severely, and financially screwed me over epically in a way that messed up my business and left me scrambling. We shared that car, I bought it and paid all expenses and repairs, until she claimed it was only hers. As she started dying, she refused to put it in my name and tried to wreck the car or destroy it. After she screwed me, I paid costs on her home that she couldn&amp;#39;t afford and let her live with me for some months until she died in hospice. -------------------------------When she finally passed away last August, I had some sort of mental break, and trying to keep a stable job has been very difficult. -------------------------In late June, I was really close to landing a 60K job, but was told that I didn&amp;#39;t seem &amp;quot;excited enough&amp;quot; for the role. So close....and I probably wasn&amp;#39;t excited, still despondent. -----------------------------The car is a huge trigger for me because of the struggle over it/that it reminds me of my Mom, but I fear being left without any car at all in a city that demands one. That car was the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; one Me, my mom and siblings had ever owned that actually ran well. Cars were always used to control/manipulate/the use restricted by my Dad, and every car &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; ever had I purchased myself. I have been carless before, and in the heat it feels pretty close to death. &amp;gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I, just junk the 2000 Nissan which is running, but doesn&amp;#39;t have tag/titles in my name? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I called the junker, they only offered $150 - $200 for it, and it&amp;#39;s a running car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My credit is ruined from a failed business, so I won&amp;#39;t be able to finance a car any time soon. It&amp;#39;s also hard to find a good used car and it would take me a while to get up enough cash to buy one.

Curious to see if people have a different thought process on this, than the reasoning I'm coming up with.


I have a brokerage account (not tax protected) that I've been investing $500 every two weeks into a Target Date retirement fund (no transaction costs), and I will continue this schedule.


My plan was to buy and hold and not think about it - just cost average and build the account.


It's added up pretty quickly and there is around 20k now, and showing 1k profit.


I'm considering putting in a stop-loss for something like $250 profit, which gives the fund quite a bit of room to drop without triggering. Also, as a Target Date fund it isn't very volatile.


The upsides I see for a stop-loss:

- I'd protect my principal from anything catastrophic

- Lock in a small profit

- Potentially resume buying at lower prices

Downsides:

- Potentially trigger the stop-loss, and miss out on gains if they resume right after

- Having to rebuild this account, and possibly lower my cost-basis in the long run

- Short term cap gains taxes

On one hand, I rationalize staying the course and not worrying about gains/losses much.

On the other hand, not protecting 20k seems silly.

*I'm financially stable and have tax protected accounts/emergency fund and all that in order, so the value isn't a concern and I don't plan on needing this money anytime in the next 5 years... more so just wondering if I'm missing any reasons NOT to do a stop-loss and protect my principal.

For now, kind of torn on what to do.

This is my first time posting here and this is some pretty basic stuff, so I apologize if this kind of thing has been posted before. 

So I’m a senior in college and my plan is to have a job immediately after I graduate. So in September-ish, I’ll be applying to jobs all over the country.

I’ve never been fantastic with money. I used to have a car that was terrible and needed repairs consistently. My mother made me pay for those repairs, which sometimes would reach upwards of $1.5k. I have gotten a new car this past January, and thankfully my father has been very willing to help me cover expenses for repairs and all that. 

During the school year, I live in a campus townhouse without a meal plan, which means I have to buy my own groceries. I do work 12 hours a week when I am at school, which gives me some money for spending alongside grocery and gas costs. 

Finally, I am working now while on break. I’ve been working roughly 20 hours a week at $12.50 an hour. I interviewed for a second job which would give me another 10 hours roughly. 

Currently, my savings account sits at around $1,300. My question is, considering my current financial situation, does it seem likely that I can move away after I graduate? Does it seem financially possible from where I stand now? And what can I do, if anything, to improve the chances of being able to do so.

I literally don't have a whole euro anymore. I've slowly used my savings to pay for my car and when I started looking back at where all my money went, I reallised that I also spend quite a lot on (unnecessary) food.
I did notice this, but I thought everything was gonna be okay, it was almost vacation, vacations means working as much as I possibly can for a few weeks to get my money back on track. But unforseen costs (money for the car) suddenly appeared.

I've started looking where my money goes and found out that most of the things are small unnecessary costs that add up. I literally can't pay for those anymore and I've started to not ask much, not even when my girlfriend asks me.

My gf does know of my situation, and isn't blaming me or making me feel bad about it, she has been in this situation before (no money, so I was the one paying for things, she didn't like that either). At the moment she is my only support.

I went to my bank and asked about information, about being in the red and about loans. Since I don't have a real contract (0 hours, weekend/vacation work) I can't get a loan. What I can do, is letting my account be able to get in the red. I'm probably gonna do that.

Thing is, personal loans I've applied for all seem to have *higher* interest rates than my current card... So it makes me wonder why people even use them? I was quoted around 18 percent as an APR on a personal loan thru sofi.

2007 Honda Accord V6 Automatic with nearly 150,000 miles. Bought for $6,300.

In the time I've had it, I've had to:

- Replace the timing belt, water pump, tensioners and idler pulleys (maintenance items, didn't have to repair anything) all done for $500

- Replace both front ball joints ($650)

- Replaced front pads and rotors ($350)

- Replaced 2 front tires ($200)

- Replaced 2 front axles ($760) due to a vibration issue. Fucked up part is that it's back now, and it hasn't been a week since I got it replaced.

My car's acceleration is also slower than when I bought it, and my cars floor shakes after starting it up and leaving it idle on park. I don't even think the spark plugs were ever replaced, and I'm not sure how much it would cost to replace that.

My steering wheel also has a shudder/vibration in it at all times regardless if I'm coasting or accelerating (although it's more pronounced on acceleration). 

Also, my wheel alignment is fucked. When I'm on a road I have to keep my steering slightly tilted either left or right, depending on the slope and what side of the road I'm on. Even after wheel alignments were done, it still pulls to one side. 

I also think the torque converter is going out since sometimes when I drive on a perfectly flat road, it feels like I'm going over small bumps. I also have a shudder from my car now and then, although I am overdue for a transmission fluid change.

My car, generally, feels like it's slowing down and struggling. 

Basically, I just don't know if I should keep this car anymore and just trade it in for a newer car while paying off the remainder after the trade. Would that be worth it or should I just keep repairing this car? I drive a lot and I use my car for work (~30-35 miles driving in heavy traffic every day). Once in a while I'll drive home for the weekends and that's an easy 110 mile round trip.

I've been seeing some Honda Civics with 70k or less for around 10-12K. I also would like a car better on gas because my Accord uses a lot of it. I don't really need a V6 car if most of my time I'll be driving for work anyways.

However, I have student loans to pay off starting in a few months, and I'll be putting in about $250 per month.

My salary after taxes is $46k per year. Rent + utilities is $1000 per month.

I now have to choose if want to bite the bullet and commit to the repair work, or if I want to deal with the headache of selling my car and look to buy again. I have decided, though unwillingly, to come to terms with the process of selling; but upon some homework, it appears that I will get around $1300-$2000 in selling for my car in this condition if I am lucky. I am in a bind of foreseeing time-sensitive repairs in addition to an already negative equity, and I am not entirely sure of which direction to take from here.

My only certainties lie at the base layer of deciding to sell. Do I sell privately? Do I attempt to trade in? Should I be looking into buying another used car? New car instead? How about CPO? What about a lease option? How should I tackle that chunk of negative equity? What cars are the cream of the crop compromise for reliability and MPG? Perhaps most of all, how do I confront these issues when I shouldn't be driving my car in the first place? 

If it at all helps, I live in Southern California, work nearly full-time, and I have excellent credit. I am asking here because I find the firsthand experiences and advice among various redditors to be quite helpful. I do appreciate any and all consideration toward my dilemma. Cheers.

&amp;#x200B;

I posted something about my situation about a month ago and got some useful advice, so wanted to follow up.  To summarize the previous post

\- early 30s male

\- $200k in student loan debt from an MBA program. 100% federal.  currently on IBR paying $0... interest compounding

\- Unemployed, got fired recently because I became non-functional at work due to anxiety.  Not really speaking or forming coherent sentences.

\- Bipolar, but not disability-level

\- anxiety/depression so severe I am not functional.  Not able to get disability since I can walk around and feed/bathe myself, but not in a stable situation I can hold down a job.  Not sure how I can get out of the mental trap I'm in now... been seeing multiple psychiatrists/therapists over the last 5 months and I am basically a stressed-out zombie.  I know, I'm mentally weak, sorry :(

\- Living with fiance, who makes good $$.  She knows about all the mental and financial problems, and still wants to get married in a few months.  Says she will support me no matter what.  So, homelessness at least seems out of the picture.

&amp;#x200B;

I have asked the fiance if she wants to break up - given that I'm unemployable for the forseeable future (maybe forever?), and debt burdened.   What if I don't ever work again, what happens to the debt on IBR after 20-25yrs?  Or if I get some minimum wage job that I can hold down and is 0 stress?  Presumably the IBR loans are compounded with interested to an insane amount of like $1m+... but then what?  She wants to buy a house (in her name)... I know I am thinking too far ahead, but I honestly don't think I'm going to ever ""get right"" in the head to make this work out.  

&amp;#x200B;

I never expected to be in this situation when I took out the loans, I was functioning great with bipolar and everything was awesome for 8yrs post-undergrad.  During my MBA I was also fine.  I've collapsed completely and the only way out I see is suicide (which would be horrible for my family and her) or being a burden and living with her and being a ""house dad"" (which would also suck but she says make her happy and I would be alive) or somehow pulling out of this mental trap (but I've been trying for 4+ months with professional help to no avail).

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on the IBR situation, if I don't end up being a functional member of the workforce in the future?  Ways to become ""collection proof""?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

I landed an interview, but thought I bombed it. But two weeks later, I got a phone call from HR double checking my salary requirements. I replied with $60k, which was about 10% more than I made at my previous job. I thought there would be some negotiating, but they sent me an offer letter with the full 60k. I obviously accepted.

Fast forward a year. I love my job and the people I work with. Everything is great.

I have access to my predecessor's inbox to be able to find pertinent information/conversations regarding old projects. One day while doing exactly that, I saw an electronic copy of her W2. I really shouldn't have clicked it, but my curiosity got the better of me and I saw that she earned over 80k in base salary. Obviously I got a bit of sticker shock, then a little jealous.

Without addressing salary at all, I asked my manager how my work compares to that of my predecessor. I know she was well liked and good at her job, so I wanted to double check that there were no gaps in job responsibilities or performance that could be used to justify a lower pay grade. My manager assured me that my performance has been equal in most cases and even exceeds in a few areas.

So I guess my question is this. In the next month or so, I have an official performance review with the head of HR, my boss, and the owner of the company (small business, approx $20mil in sales annually.) How can I use this new found knowledge to approach this conversation? Obviously I am not going to mention the W2. I have been very happy with this company and have no desire to leave. I don't even truly feel underpaid. But now that I know that I left money on the table, I want to see what we can work out.

My past 2 purchases(2006 Ford Fusion with 80,000 miles and 2006 Ford Explorer with about 100,000 miles) were both about $10,000. The Fusion was about 8 years old when we bought it and the Explorer was about 10. As I look at replacing either of these it seems their value is half what I paid at best and replacements that are about 10 years old and 100,000 miles are $15,000 or so(Explorers, I haven't looked at Fusions). Maybe I'm cheap but I hate the spending that much on a used car with that many miles. I'm wondering if I was to try and buy newer lower mileage cars would I have less of a hit if I was to then sell them in 2 or 3 years. I don't need to sell them that soon, I'm just wondering if doing something like that would lower the cost of ownership per year. Can I buy a car for $20k, drive it for 2 or 3 years and sell it for $16K? We take very good care of or vehicles and put less than 10,000 miles on them in a year.

We are in our early 30's, debt free except our house which has a very reasonable 15 year mortgage. We only pay cash for cars. I know we would both cringe at spending so much but we could comfortably pay $20,000 for something newer.

EDIT: Thank you all you're pretty much confirmed what I thought and hoped wasn't the case. I guess all cars, even used are just getting more and more expensive just like everything else. For what it's worth I'm loyal to Ford and I don't see that changing. We'll probably just keeps our cars another 5 years or so and then look for replacements. I do pretty much all my own work so they are cheap to keep. When it's time to buy we'll probably look for something more in the 5-7 year old range than the 10 year old.

My past 2 purchases(2006 Ford Fusion with 80,000 miles and 2006 Ford Explorer with about 100,000 miles) were both about $10,000. The Fusion was about 8 years old when we bought it and the Explorer was about 10. As I look at replacing either of these it seems their value is half what I paid at best and replacements that are about 10 years old and 100,000 miles are $15,000 or so(Explorers, I haven&amp;#39;t looked at Fusions). Maybe I&amp;#39;m cheap but I hate the spending that much on a used car with that many miles. I&amp;#39;m wondering if I was to try and buy newer lower mileage cars would I have less of a hit if I was to then sell them in 2 or 3 years. I don&amp;#39;t need to sell them that soon, I&amp;#39;m just wondering if doing something like that would lower the cost of ownership per year. Can I buy a car for $20k, drive it for 2 or 3 years and sell it for $16K? We take very good care of or vehicles and put less than 10,000 miles on them in a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in our early 30&amp;#39;s, debt free except our house which has a very reasonable 15 year mortgage. We only pay cash for cars. I know we would both cringe at spending so much but we could comfortably pay $20,000 for something newer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thank you all you&amp;#39;re pretty much confirmed what I thought and hoped wasn&amp;#39;t the case. I guess all cars, even used are just getting more and more expensive just like everything else. For what it&amp;#39;s worth I&amp;#39;m loyal to Ford and I don&amp;#39;t see that changing.

&amp;#x200B;

throw away account because my spouse occasionally peruses reddit. I'm not sure why, but I'd prefer her to not know I was seeking financial advice on the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

My spouse and I are in our mid 30's with one child. Together our household income isn't anything to be wildly jealous of, but we're above the average household income in our province Between $100,000 - $130,000 a year (Gross). We're not in financial trouble or anything, we both work hard at our jobs and make a good living, have a house, 2 financed vehicles

&amp;#x200B;

But,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm irresponsible with money. We do all of our banking together, there are no secrets about hidden debt. I would also like to preface this by stating that I do not gamble, smoke, drink excessively or have any of the typical addictions that are common (at least, that I know of). I just.. spend money. 20$ here, 60$ there. At the time of spending, it seems like such an insignificant amount, but over time it builds up to a number that feels much more significant. Total debt in my name is about $17,000. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of that debt was used to buy things for our house and do some renovations, some if it was a failed small business side hustle attempt, but the rest of it was all me, spending money on stupid stuff. Food, coffee, video games, gifts for my spouse (maybe this one isn't stupid, but definitely excessive. I like to make her feel good with pretty things every once in a while, but I use my personal credit so she doesn't see the cost) etc...

&amp;#x200B;

While it's not crippling debt, it's still debt that I'd like to discontinue accumulating before I cause actual financial troubles for us. What can I do to curb my irresponsible spending habits?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello personal finance,&lt;/p&gt;

I just heard about this sub reddit, made a new account because I don't want others to know who I am. I haven't posted here before, and I'm hoping I can get some simple solid advice.

I currently do my employer matched 3% IRA. The debt I have is $300k for my house (home value is $425k), $310k for student loans (grad school), and $60k personal loans. I have a wife and 2 kids, I'm likely to get another raise this month to $112k/annual or so, and my future with my current company looks good, been with them almost 5 years. We own both our cars, and take one nice vacation a year. My monthly payments on the mortgage, personal loans, and student debts eat up pretty much all of our money. Maybe a few hundred bucks left over each month ($400-$600 to do with what we please). We have not fell behind in any payments, and have $3k in savings. Credit score is 765 for me and 795 for the wife.

One friend suggested we buy a few trailers with our good credit and open land we can store them on, and rent them out as a side business to supplement our income. He says he gets $120-$140 a night per trailer and the monthly cost on the trailer loan is $120 -- and he can rent them out 2-5 times a month @ 2-3 days each, so he's making $300 to $800 profit per trailer each month. Honestly this sounds like a good option, but I would have to finance it with more loans (would likely be no problem qualifying). I'm also very business savvy and competitive, so I'm sure I could get these things rented out... it just means more loans and more debt.  Sales comes naturally, personal money management has not. I tend to spend most of the money I earn. If I earn a lot I spend a lot, if I earn little I spend little. I've never defaulted on a loan though, I've always made ends meet. Even 6 years ago when I was making $16/hr and supporting the family. 

It's setting in that I'm not 23 anymore... And I haven't done a good job saving $. Feeling stressed and worried for my future and the kids future. Feeling helpless for the long term right now.

There are so many little things most people never check in to that they would be surprised just how much cash they are hemorrhaging unwittingly. Some examples off the top of my head:

* $10/month for a cable modem 
* Slow-creeping increases to your monthly bills for things you probably don't need and are over paying for
* Unused streaming service subscriptions
* Paying interest on debts you could pay off that you forgot about because they're auto deducted

..and the list goes on. My MiL had been paying $100 to the phone company for 15MB dsl and a phone line before ditching it for 100MB cable internet for $50/month and just using her cellphone. Just because she was used to it. This went on for over a decade for no reason. 

Just watching where your money is going should alert you of these changes. Investigating your bills and calling and questioning what charges are can really add up. With so many people using autopay and not tracking their money or budgeting these days I think a lot of people would be shocked just how much money they are losing for things they really do not use.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to post for awhile now but just haven&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s honestly exhausting at times, but keeping tabs of where your money is going and understanding why and for what is important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many little things most people never check in to that they would be surprised just how much cash they are hemorrhaging unwittingly. Some examples off the top of my head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$10/month for a cable modem &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow-creeping increases to your monthly bills for things you probably don&amp;#39;t need and are over paying for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unused streaming service subscriptions&lt;/li&gt;

 had ordered a couple of times from Costco’s SameDay service that delivers via Instacart and thought (naively) that it was a decent deal- looking back, I think our initial order might have had free delivery as a promo.

The slip-up was when the driver gave me the Costco receipt and I then tried to  correlate the $108 amount on the receipt with the $153 charged to our account.  While I understand that Instacart might inflate prices a bit, but it turned out to average out at about an 20% up charge on all items.  Then there was ~$6.19 mandatory tip, a $6.16 service fee, and then a $8.99 deliver fee- all on top of the 20% inflation on the items we ordered.

Usually Costco is a solid bet, but wow, not when Instacart is in the mix.  Not again!

  Edit:

Ok, to clarify a few points:

1. I don't mind paying for delivery, I am not entitled (thank you very much), I just don't think Costco/Insta are very upfront with what they are charging
2. As a sanity check, I just fired up a new order and got to the point of the ""Place Order"" button and there was no mention of any delivery fees, tips, or service fees and there is definitely no place where they call out **how much they inflate their prices**
3. As a consumer, I expect that when I hit a ""Place Order"" button, that amount is what I will pay or pretty close to it.  If I had a legit checkout screen where I was told that I was paying a 20% upcharge on all items **and** $21 dollars in fees, I probably would have made other plans.
4. If they were upfront with their fees and inflation, I might actually use them once in a while when I really-really didn't want to brave the crowds at Costco- but not when I am gambling on how much my final bill might be.
5. I am a pretty savvy online shopper, I rarely (if ever) get surprised post-purchase on something like this, and I left this experience feeling a bit bamboozled.
6. I get that if I read into their T&amp;C deep enough, I am sure this is all spelled out enough that I am fully responsible for this, but as a modern consumer I shouldn't have to read through the boilerplate.  What I see on the screen at the checkout should be what I pay (unless it is someplace like McMaster-Carr who does what they want and you expect it).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR: We were charged $153 for an $108 purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;had ordered a couple of times from Costco’s SameDay service that delivers via Instacart and thought (naively) that it was a decent deal- looking back, I think our initial order might have had free delivery as a promo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slip-up was when the driver gave me the Costco receipt and I then tried to  correlate the $108 amount on the receipt with the $153 charged to our account.  While I understand that Instacart might inflate prices a bit, but it turned out to average out at about an 20% up charge on all items.  Then there was ~$6.19 mandatory tip, a $6.16 service fee, and then a $8.99 deliver fee- all on top of the 20% inflation on the items we ordered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually Costco is a solid bet, but wow, not when Instacart is in the mix.  Not again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, to clarify a few points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t mind paying for delivery, I am not entitled (thank you very much), I just don&amp;#39;t think Costco/Insta are very upfront with what they are charging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a sanity check, I just fired up a new order and got to the point of the &amp;quot;Place Order&amp;quot; button and there was no mention of any delivery fees, tips, or service fees and there is definitely no place where they call out &lt;strong&gt;how much they inflate their prices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a consumer, I expect that when I hit a &amp;quot;Place Order&amp;quot; button, that amount is what I will pay or pretty close to it.  If I had a legit checkout screen where I was told that I was paying a 20% upcharge on all items &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; $21 dollars in fees, I probably would have made other plans.&lt;/li&gt;

Consolidation Loan: $10,065 Min Payment: $317 Interest Rate: 18%

CC1 Current Balance: $311 Min Payment: $25 CC Limit: 500 Interest Rate: 27%

CC2 CB: $2441 Min Payment: $85 CC Limit: $1000 26%  (Bank error gave me lots of money, dumbass 21 y/o me blew through it and so I have been paying that back)

CC3 CB: $710 Min Payment: $50 CC Limit: $1050 IR: 29%

&amp;#x200B;

Sorta budget (working on it, hoping for more guidance here):

Income: $3200

Monthly bills:

Phone: $73

Car insurance: $110

Minimum Debt payments: $860

Food: $\~200

Netflix/Music: $25

Job doesn't offer retirement plan so I will be looking for a company to do this with, but currently do not contribute to anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I make about $3200/month. I just started this job and will get my first full pay period paycheck on the 15. I get paid twice a month. I had issues with credit cards in the past, and as you can see, am now paying for it. I now have a much healthier relationship with money. I just started this job and would like to start throwing money at my debt, and get better credit cards and use them properly. My goal is to have all credit card debt gone, as well as get my consolidation loan paid off, or at least as low as I possibly can.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  I am looking to spend about 700-800 on rent monthly. I will be getting an apartment with a friend. The only thing bad about my credit score is my credit-debt ratio and credit utilization. I have made all my payments all time, have had a credit card since 19, so about 5 years of credit history. I am working on making a proper budget now. I like to cook and stay with my parents currently so I do not spend too much money on food. My only current issue is that at my job we either eat fast food for lunch, or you eat cold food, due to being somewhere new everyday. Currently I have been eating fast food, but am looking into my options on bringing lunch, so I can eat warm food for lunch. I know it has been said time and time again about staying with the parents as long as you can, but I need to get out. At the latest, September is when I will move out, but for my mental health, the earlier the better.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, how do I attack my debt best to get a decent credit score to not worry about being declined, all the while saving for a deposit, admin fees, application fees, and whatever else? Not too worried about furniture and the likes. I have been collecting a lot of things this past year that I know I will need to furnish an apartment, and I can live with the minimum for the time being.

Also, when paying down debt, the credit card companies seem to report to the credit bureaus at the end of the month. If I end up making a payment in the middle of the month, will that show up on a credit report that an apartment company can see, or will it have to wait until the end of the month?

They had similar mileage (around 27K) and are both pretty reliable cars from what I've researched online and through friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

The boss claims that he wants to buy out the lease (of which he has 2 years left) and sell the car so that he can get a different car. He mentioned that his car was worth $17K but I'm not entirely sure where he's getting this number from. It could be that he meant that the price to buy out his lease is $17K or that if he buys out the lease and sells it back to the dealer, they would pay 17K?? I'm honestly not sure.. but he wants to sell me the car for $14K and that's where it becomes shady. I have yet to see the Camry, but when I saw the Passat today it was OVERALL in decent shape. All of his rims has scratches on them, there's a tiny scratch on the hood and front bumper, some plastic looking thing hanging off right by the driver side wheel under the car, and he's also a smoker. 

&amp;#x200B;

He wouldn't let me test drive it today for ""insurance reasons"" but gave the okay to bring it to a mechanic. I'm not entirely sure if he means he'll let me drive it to the mechanic myself because why wouldn't he just claim ""insurance reasons"" again. If he doesn't let me test drive the car I will absolutely not be buying the car and will be pretty pissed he wasted my time. Also it's 4th of July soon and the deals will be pretty good I assume, so I’m hoping to buy a car ASAP. I can't imagine that he would back out of the deal but I also know that this is entirely possible too. This whole thing seems a bit sketchy to me but saving $4K would be great.

&amp;#x200B;

Luckily I'm still 18 and have zero debt. However it's never too early to start planning for a more comfortable life when I get out and planning is something I'll need more than others because I do not have a diploma.

&amp;#x200B;

Some may say go to college after but the only job I really want is a simple police officer position in my home county so it kinda seems like a waste of time where I can be doing something more productive (most police departments accept GEDs with no further education and we have plenty of family friends in the area I want to be) 

&amp;#x200B;

Although I have a strong urge to go into a large amount of debt for a charger, I need to plan on what things I can invest in, to create that passive income that all the business guru's talk about. A big buzzword I've noticed all of them saying is ""real estate"" but there are two things I know: Never blindly trust someone who is selling a book on advice and its not as easy as it sounds. But if renting out a house isnt the best way to get something profitable, what is?

&amp;#x200B;

 I've also been practicing the art of story telling through screenwriting and novels in the past few years and once I perfect my craft I may be able to sell some copies of something I write too (not why I write, its just a thought of something I can work on while I'm sitting in the barracks or something) 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing I need to consider is where I'll live after 4-8 years of service (the pension isnt worth it to me). Do I take money I can be investing into something and rent a place where I'm going to work or do i suck up my pride and move in with my mom or dad until I'm in a position with a decent paycheck (police recruits don't make much) 

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;Some may say go to college after but the only job I really want is a simple police officer position in my home county so it kinda seems like a waste of time where I can be doing something more productive (most police departments accept GEDs with no further education and we have plenty of family friends in the area I want to be) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have a strong urge to go into a large amount of debt for a charger, I need to plan on what things I can invest in, to create that passive income that all the business guru&amp;#39;s talk about. A big buzzword I&amp;#39;ve noticed all of them saying is &amp;quot;real estate&amp;quot; but there are two things I know: Never blindly trust someone who is selling a book on advice and its not as easy as it sounds. But if renting out a house isnt the best way to get something profitable, what is?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been practicing the art of story telling through screenwriting and novels in the past few years and once I perfect my craft I may be able to sell some copies of something I write too (not why I write, its just a thought of something I can work on while I&amp;#39;m sitting in the barracks or something) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I need to consider is where I&amp;#39;ll live after 4-8 years of service (the pension isnt worth it to me). Do I take money I can be investing into something and rent a place where I&amp;#39;m going to work or do i suck up my pride and move in with my mom or dad until I&amp;#39;m in a position with a decent paycheck (police recruits don&amp;#39;t make much) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any advice is super helpful! What would you suggest I invest in? Do you have any good resources for spotting good deals on things like real estate and other investments? Any other good things I can work on for a good passive income? Thank you for reading!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to move out to start a masters in 2 or 3 years time so I&amp;#39;m looking at ways to invest what money I do have for future use. I&amp;#39;d also like to put some money aside over the next few years for my two youngest brothers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just looking for advice on where to start and what to look into as I have next to no idea on how this all works. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

I am a 19 year old college student starting a new job and trying to devise a plan for what I should do with my money in the near future, before graduating I suppose. Right now I have about $8k saved, \~$3k in a Roth IRA, no debt, and about $150 in mandatory monthly expenses. I live at home, commute to school, and have a lot of support from my parents (for which I am grateful for). The mandatory expenses are an approximate gas/car/cell phone payment to them, though it would be a bit more without their help. My tuition is fully covered by way of savings and the lack of room &amp; board. My new monthly income will be about $950 a month.

So anyway, my next financial goal is to purchase a new vehicle. Currently I drive an older car which is almost 20 years old and think I should look towards replacing it next year. I'd like to get something a little nicer or ""upgrade"" I suppose, but I don't want to be stupid and waste all my savings. I was shooting for something around $15k. I guess what I'm wondering in short is:

1. How much should I shoot to save each month? I was thinking about $500, if not more.
2. What kind of car should I be looking at or does anyone recommend?
3. How much should I spend on a new vehicle? What percentage of my savings would be safe to use?
4. Is this a dumb idea that would cost too much?

Let me preface this by saying that I'm a dealer and I probably run, I dunno, 20+ Carfax reports a day and evaluate 20+ cars a day.

A minor accident, say a scuffed bumper, when reported to the Police, will generally end up as an accident reported on your car's Carfax/Autocheck report.  I would say that virtually every accident that's on a vehicle history report (VHR) is from a police report.  Period.

Now, on a late model car this is, as a general rule of thumb, about a 10% or so hit to your car's value even if the damage was very minor.  In an extreme example that comes to mind was a year old Bentley Continental Convertible where a $1,000 claim to repair a scuffed bumper ended up costing the owner $30,000 in lost value due to the car having a ""bad Carfax"" (YOU try selling a year old Bentley with an accident on the Carfax... I dare you).

So, if your car has very minor cosmetic damage, you may want to think it over before you make a police report if you can avoid it.  If your car is in a legit accident, go ahead and make that report.  But if you come out of the grocery store to a scuffed bumper, you may want to reconsider making that report.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes up from time to time and I felt that this needed a post.&lt;/p&gt;

Throwaway because I enjoy my privacy. Ohio, US

&amp;#x200B;

My father passed in April, and after much back and forth with his employer and the company a check should be showing up in the mail within about a week, maybe two. ""7 - 10 business days,"" you know.

&amp;#x200B;

He had two lines listed on his employer account. One that said ""employer life insurance policy"" that he had mentioned was a basic one his employer had for all employees regardless of their opt in, and one that was an additional $20,000.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna leave out my family constantly harassing me, etc because that's not so finance related as it is to who they are as people.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the letter I got in the mail mentioned the ""check for S74,xxx.xx"" This is obviously far more than the 20k expected. I called to confirm and she read off the same number to me. I don't know where the other $54k came from, and the couple hundred dollars is interest from his date of death (the math checks out to be $74k base plus a couple hundred in interest).

&amp;#x200B;

I have to pay off his funeral, which is on a credit card (0% interest, cash back) which is like $4400 plus like $1500 I have from additional recent expenses and a 5 month bout of unemployment. There's a couple other things I need to pay for, so let's say a maximum of $10k is gone.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a monthly car (lease, so not super interested in paying it off. I do know this is a ""poor"" financial choice.) and insurance payment that I'll be soon getting a job to pay for/running a small side business (some assumptions with that being a success, but we'll see). I'd like to keep this money as a nest egg, throw it in a 2% Ally account, whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

A major concern of mine is that I am a student. Having $64k just floating around, even with no or little income, will presumably ruin my financial aid. If necessary to use this to pay, that's fine, but I was wondering if this was the case or if it could be avoided?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to take advantage of a bit of travel before Fall semester starts. TBD, nothing big. Maybe a week road trip in the US or to Japan, Thailand, maximum a couple grand.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't mind some minor investing of a small chunk of the money. Nothing volatile like crypto, so probably bonds or a Vanguard or the typical r/personalfinance suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if there were any general suggestions or advice that I'd find useful. I used to be a star r/personalfinance pupil, but wandered astray last year with my vehicle purchase and fell off the bandwagon with general expenditures.

First question; is it better to pay off the 40% quickly or continue to make the monthly payment until the whole amount is paid off? Currently they're not reporting the monthly payment so it still shows as a charge off on my credit report.

Should I just wait for them to fall off my credit report?

We didn't think they would accept our lowball offer, but they did.  We paid 185k for our current home, which is nearly paid off.

Some stats:

* Our net take home is \~15k/month
* We have no debts outside of our current mortgage which is almost paid off
* Have a total of \~500k liquid.  Still unsure what to put down toward this new house.
* This purchase wouldn't affect our ability to max out our retirement

I am sure those stats look OK for this, but we also just had a kid (and plan to have one more).

&amp;#x200B;

The real concern we have is just the magnitude of upgrading so quickly to a much larger/better home in a higher cost of living area.  It's much better for our little one, he'll have better chances of meeting friends and being able to walk to their house, this new house is absolutely awesome, we would greatly enjoy the walkability of the location of the new home.

I live in Sarasota, Florida with my wife, no kids, just 1 dog.  We spend about $600 a month on groceries, we ALWAYS cook at home and pretty much never go out to restaurants, we eat regular healthy food, nothing too fancy.

&amp;#x200B;

Not that this sub needs any convincing, but I want to share a small win for an average budgeter. By ""average budgeter"" I mean I use a free algorithm to track my income and expenditures. I wouldn't call myself particularly frugal, but I track with extreme discipline. 

&amp;#x200B;

One expenditure in which I regularly indulge is waxing. In January 2019 I bought a package of (12) appointments for the price of (9), which was to be charged to my credit card in the form of (4) equal payments across (4) months. 

&amp;#x200B;

The end of June rolls around and I settle down to track my money. Cue my discovery of several unfamiliar charges from the waxing vendor that exceeds my package total by $400. I call the vendor but can't get any answers from the person behind the desk. They promise to have their district manager call me, but after several days and no such call, I immediately reach out to my bank to dispute the charges.

 

My bank--let's call it JPChorgan Mace--had extreme difficulty categorizing the problem since I recognized \*some\* of the charges from the vendor but not all. They couldn't decide whether to put me through to the dispute department or to the fraud department. I ended up bouncing between the two departments no fewer than fifteen (yes, 15) times, and each conversation required a complete explanation of events and always resulted in the same recommendations: ""well have you called the vendor?"" and ""have you tried to reach their corporate headquarters?"" and ""well you probably signed some fine print somewhere that authorized the charges."" No matter how many times I assured my bank that I do in fact read the paperwork I sign, they were convinced I'd missed something. One bank representative, Damon, even explained to me at length the ""drowning man"" phenomenon. I eventually had to terminate the call without any answers because I--shockingly--had other things to do.

&amp;#x200B;

So yesterday I set aside an entire afternoon to call the vendor again. I refused to accept their persistent offers to ""call me back"" and instead stayed on hold for hours. When I was finally connected to a district manager, we spent another hour walking through the charges and trying to account for the discrepancy. Turns out they HAD overcharged me by $400. As way of apology, the manager not only refunded my money but also gifted me 6 months of free service. Meanwhile, JPChorgan Mace is still filing their investigation paperwork that will take 90 days to resolve... and writing me off as a total dunderhead while they do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the context:

\- currently max out employer 401ks (partner + self) 19k each year

\- looking to sell current home to buy the next one that is better fit for family 

\- cash for downpayment for next house is tied up in first one

\- live in a market where the type of house we're looking for goes quickly, sellers are wary of sale contingencies and we have to do some repairs/painting to our current home before selling that would be challenging while still living in it

\- plan is to take loan from 401ks (partner + self) for \~100k total (50 each) and repay almost immediately once the proceeds from the first home close (maybe wait a month to make sure no unexpected costs pop up)

\- loan terms from the 401k provider at 5 year 6.5% interest includes total interest of $17322

\- employer apparently only allows either monthly deductions (\~980 total for both loans together) or payment in full

\- we expect to net \~130,000 from sale of first home after closing costs

\- plan would be to use $117,322 to repay the loans in full within 1-2 months of sale closing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Since we already max out our 401ks each year how would this not violate the max contribution limits?** In essence we'd be contributing the 38k normal contribution + an additional 17k in interest costs that would have otherwise been distributed across the life of that loan.  Realize that the 17k in interest payment isn't tax free but it still seems like an otherwise precluded contribution despite not having that benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

Or is this just a loophole, and why then wouldn't more people take advantage of it each year by artificially loaning themselves dollars and then immediately repaying?

&lt;p&gt;- live in a market where the type of house we&amp;#39;re looking for goes quickly, sellers are wary of sale contingencies and we have to do some repairs/painting to our current home before selling that would be challenging while still living in it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- plan is to take loan from 401ks (partner + self) for ~100k total (50 each) and repay almost immediately once the proceeds from the first home close (maybe wait a month to make sure no unexpected costs pop up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- loan terms from the 401k provider at 5 year 6.5% interest includes total interest of $17322&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- employer apparently only allows either monthly deductions (~980 total for both loans together) or payment in full&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- we expect to net ~130,000 from sale of first home after closing costs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- plan would be to use $117,322 to repay the loans in full within 1-2 months of sale closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since we already max out our 401ks each year how would this not violate the max contribution limits?&lt;/strong&gt; In essence we&amp;#39;d be contributing the 38k normal contribution + an additional 17k in interest costs that would have otherwise been distributed across the life of that loan.  Realize that the 17k in interest payment isn&amp;#39;t tax free but it still seems like an otherwise precluded contribution despite not having that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is this just a loophole, and why then wouldn&amp;#39;t more people take advantage of it each year by artificially loaning themselves dollars and then immediately repaying? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr - wouldn&amp;#39;t repaying a 401k loan early with total interest essentially be a way to get around 19,000 contribution limit?&lt;/p&gt;

She's been talking to debt relief companies and has one picked out.

After a couple of years they negotiate with collections to bargain down the balance, pay it off with the money you've paid in, and take a fee for themselves.

Now this lights up some alarms for me but she's comfortable with this plan of action. She's been through bankruptcy before and dealt with collectors plenty in the past, NBD. She doesn't care about her credit. She wants to let this all go and let someone else deal with the negotiations and so on, and work with her on credit repair after the fact. If she signs on to this plan she can let go of the mental burden of thinking about this any more.

She also wants to sell the second home but it's going to take some serious work to clean and fix up. It's basically been ruined by a close friend of hers whom she's allowed to live there for 10 years. We'd have to move the friend somewhere else while we do renovations. My other brother can do most of the reno work but they'll need to finance these efforts and I don't want to get myself tied up in that. I have plenty of that kind of work to do on my own place.

I have another call with the debt relief company tomorrow. I'm going to get their agreement sent over so I can read it in detail. Anything in particular I need to ask them or look out for?

So I've decided to take a year off of college, I've been going for two years for mechanical engineering but haven't really made good progress because lack of effort. Great high school student but college has been a game changer, I have motivation just lacking the effort therefore grades have begun slipping. I don't want to put anymore effort into paying for something I'm not fully invested in yet, so I'm taking a year off and getting a full time job.

 I've accumulated 11K USD in debt from those two years and I'm sure I'll start having to pay them off soon. I have about 2K USD in savings and an additional grand for spending. Monthly expenses don't exceed more than $300 but I'm also a person who has alot of wants. I also plan on moving upstate to transfer to the school where I would need to do the full program as I've just been doing prerequisites. The move would accompany a roommate to help with expenses so potentially $300-500 a month post move. I would also find a new job to help finance new school and the move.

So with all that being said, I have a potential full time job lined up for the next few months that will bring in a significant raise compared to what I make part time.  My plan is to have six months rent ($3k) set aside for fallback and then get the necessary items I need before I move (Car maintenance, Auto parts, savings). Additionally I plan on getting any unnecessary wants before the move that way I don't have to manage money even more post move and make a clean break. 

Any advice or opinions on this plan? I think it's decent but I'm sure some of you have some better additions. 

TL;DR: Plan on moving out within the year.

Part of this is because it will save months off of the payoff date but it's also because I'm working at a start-up so it's possible it or the economy as a whole could go belly-up at some point and due to the family situation I'm not able to move to find something else for some time (my city is pretty shitty for my skillset.

However every single consolidation site I've checked either does not allow spousal cosign at all, or if they do the applications gets immediately rejected because her income is zero even though mine is more than enough to handle it.

About $30k of it is &amp;gt;6% interest and I&amp;#39;d like to consolidate that portion into something lower interest to make the payoff faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of this is because it will save months off of the payoff date but it&amp;#39;s also because I&amp;#39;m working at a start-up so it&amp;#39;s possible it or the economy as a whole could go belly-up at some point and due to the family situation I&amp;#39;m not able to move to find something else for some time (my city is pretty shitty for my skillset. I was lucky to find anything at all). It might be possible I that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to pay into it for a while so I&amp;#39;d like to keep the interest growth on it as low as possible in case that happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However every single consolidation site I&amp;#39;ve checked either does not allow spousal cosign at all, or if they do the applications gets immediately rejected because her income is zero even though mine is more than enough to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there consolidation services available that would be fine with the debtor not having income if the spouse cosigns for it? Or would most people consider this a small enough amount to just power through it and just hope that nothing happens?&lt;/p&gt;

For her first year of fellowship, she was paid by a private medical system (not the university) that partners with the university and shares the hospital.  She just started her second year of fellowship.  She will now be paid by the university for the next two years.  It is a completely separate benefits system.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the university does not provide a normal, salaried wage.  Instead, they provide a nonqualified scholarship for the fellows equal to their entire monetary compensation.  Today, she had a meeting about this new arrangement, and I have some major concerns about its impact on her finances.

&amp;#x200B;

Since a nonqualified scholarship is considered a stipend payment, there is no 401k or FSA available to her as with her previous employer.  We had previously been maxing out her 401k (19K) and FSA (5K).  With this new arrangement, we are now looking at an additional 24K of taxable income since there is no way to divert these funds pre-tax.  At 22% tax (our tax bracket), that's $5280 of additional taxes each year.  Plus, her previous employer would match some of the 401k contributions.  So we're losing that too.  All in all, this means about a 9% income cut for her, despite a ""raise"" that accompanies her transition from a first year fellow to a second year fellow.

&amp;#x200B;

At the meeting, the guy said ""You may want to talk through this with your tax advisor because there's a chance they haven't seen this before.""

&amp;#x200B;

There must be financial benefits for the university (I assume by listing it as a ""scholarship""), but I feel like my wife is getting fleeced.

I make $60,000, he makes $40,000, and house aside we are both 100% debt free. Each of the room mates makes about $20,000/yr, respectively.

Overall we were in a good position to buy, except that I fucked up during the due diligence period - I saw something on the home inspection that I felt warranted a structural engineer's advice.  I asked repeatedly to get an engineer to look at some soft joists in the crawlspace.  My agent said she didn't feel like that was necessary, and my dumb ass listened to her.

So now we have... wait for it.... 20 rotting floor joists that need either re-enforced or replaced.  Good news is that my agent is still wanting to be involved... she was mortified at these findings and actually offered to pay for the entirety of the structural repairs in full, but I talked her into 50/50 because I feel I am equally at fault for this.

Additionally, all of my ductwork was ripped out in preparation to replace the old ducts, as it was all original and full of holes and mold due to moisture buildup in the crawlspace.  I am having the crawlspace encapsulated, with french drains and a sump put in.

Total major repairs include:

1. breaker box replacement (it was a fire hazard and has already been replaced)
2. HVAC replacement (currently have no HVAC ducts at all, as the structural rot was discovered during the removal of the old ducts)
3. crawlspace encapsulation, french drains, sump pump (half-way done; was going to just be a dehumidifier and vapor barrier, but I am now leaning toward encapsulation simply due to how bad the crawlspace is, and will continue to be, in this humid North Carolina weather)
4. structural repairs

&amp;#x200B;

I went into this deal expecting to put around $15,000 into repairs.  Now it looks like I'm going to be putting in about $30,000 total.  Thankfully I still have about $14,000 in the bank, and access to a $50,000 line of credit through my credit union if need be.  I can also finance the new ductwork, and right now we are getting by on 2 window air conditioners to hold us over.

I know I fucked up big time.  But, looking forward, if anyone has some tidbits of advice to share about how to best navigate this scenario, I am all ears.

\------------------------------------------

EDIT:  I am drafting up an email to my agent letting her know I've reconsidered her offer to cover the full cost of the joist repair.  Being that she would be fronting the bill, should allow her to choose the contractor who will do the work?

EDIT:

\[REDACTED\],

I'm writing to let you know  that I have  reconsidered your original offer, and would like to accept your  assistance to cover the full cost of the joist repair if you would agree  to it.  I apologize for my inconsistency on this issue over the past  several days; there has been a lot to weigh and consider regarding how  best to address this. I have done much thinking and debating about what  is right and fair given the context of the situation, and I do believe  that your offer to cover these repairs is completely reasonable and  would help to make this right.

Please let me know if you would  agree to this.  Above all, I appreciate your continued contact with me  throughout this ordeal, and your willingness to help see me through it.   As stated before, I would still like to continue a working relationship  with you in the future, and I will be sure to forward you the CAD  drawing and plans as soon as I have acquired them from \[REDACTED\].

Thank you for your time,

\---------  


UPDATE!!! - my agent has agreed to pay for the entirety of the joist repairs.  I'm going to be reaching out to a second engineering company today to get another opinion on the scope of work.  Thanks everyone who encouraged me to go back and ask for my agent's assistance.  If nothing else this entire experience is teaching me a lot of valuable life lessons, like how to deal with people in tough situations and to be more assertive.  Silver linings, I guess.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purchased a $245,000 home in Durham, NC last month, with 5% down at 3.625% interest. Mortgage is $1300, PMI is only $60/m.  House is in my name but I have a long term boyfriend of 8 years and 2 long-term room mates, each person paying me $475/m.  I make $60,000, he makes $40,000, and house aside we are both 100% debt free. Each of the room mates makes about $20,000/yr, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall we were in a good position to buy, except that I fucked up during the due diligence period - I saw something on the home inspection that I felt warranted a structural engineer&amp;#39;s advice.  I asked repeatedly to get an engineer to look at some soft joists in the crawlspace.  My agent said she didn&amp;#39;t feel like that was necessary, and my dumb ass listened to her.&lt;/p&gt;

We have excellent tenants that just signed a lease for another year back in February. My mortgage payment on this house is $1200/month on an FHA loan and our rental income is $1575/month. We owe $150,000 on the house and all of the comparable homes are selling for \~$220,000. Currently our only debt is my student loans at $35,000 and the two mortgages. Since we have moved, we have welcomed our first child to the world and my wife has quit her job to stay at home with him. We were working through a budget and dedicating a lot of money to our student loans (paid off all of her $15,000 and $15,000 of mine in 1.5 years.) but being reduced to a single income has put a halt to going above the minimum payment. I am of the mindset to continue renting the home out as long as it is profitable while my wife would like to sell and pay off all of our debt. I would like to get a consensus on our course of action...obviously selling would take place next February at the end of the lease.

We have excellent tenants that just signed a lease for another year back in February. My mortgage payment on this house is $1200/month on an FHA loan and our rental income is $1575/month. We owe $150,000 on the house and all of the comparable homes are selling for ~$220,000. Currently our only debt is my student loans at $35,000 and the two mortgages. Since we have moved, we have welcomed our first child to the world and my wife has quit her job to stay at home with him. We were working through a budget and dedicating a lot of money to our student loans (paid off all of her $15,000 and $15,000 of mine in 1.5 years.) but being reduced to a single income has put a halt to going above the minimum payment. I am of the mindset to continue renting the home out as long as it is profitable while my wife would like to sell and pay off all of our debt. I would like to get a consensus on our course of action...obviously selling would take place next February at the end of the lease. &lt;/p&gt;

I have found a worthwhile school that teaches the fundamentals of cosmetic tattooing (lip, eyeliner and eyebrow). The course price is around $7200. Further education comes in Fall for Areola tattooing at another institute (clinically accredited) price being around $3000. 

I have never taken out a loan. My credit score is one point away from the “good” range. I’ve had a secured card for about almost a year with no late payments. My last debt (of a small amount from an old apartment complex in 2015) was just paid off yesterday.

I just quit had my last day at my job as a barback on Sunday and I will be relying on dog walking, freelance design jobs and etsy  until I can charge for the cosmetic tattooing.

The class registration begins in a little under 2 weeks. The course is July 30-August 7. I can immediately start charging customers right out of the gate (just at a discounted price for the first 15-20 customers).

Anyway back to my question... I cannot apply for a student loan for this type of certification. What loans should I look into? I can put up about 25% initially but it will set my wallet back quite a bit. I use a credit union for my personal banking.

Recently I started doing some research into personal finance more specially regarding long term investments, I have roughly 15k separated from my emergency fund that are sitting in a low interest account. After a lot of research it seems as the best way to invest it is in ETF following a Market Index like S&amp;P 500, most people recommend Vanguard ETFs.

After trying to open an account on Several Brokers including Vanguard it seems that it is not possible because you need to have a social security number or at least an Address in the US, I have neither since I don't live there, I live in Panama.

I need advice regarding the two topics which Index fund you recommend (considering I am a 30M with 29F wife with no immediate need of the money) and how to set up the account to continuously purchase the fund, I intent to set aside a portion of my monthly income into it.

It is a somewhat complicated and unique situation, so I thought I would maybe find some advice here.


My girlfriend is currently going through a divorce, although she has been separated for about 3 years. Her ex had a lot of criminal charges against him which has prolonged the process for a very long time. During their separation, she was stuck raising and supporting their son on her own until I came along about a year ago. She owns a mobile home and pays rent on the land which is in a mobile park in New Hampshire.
 

Since she has been on her own it has been difficult to keep up with expenses and she now owes about $12,000 in back taxes on the property. There was recently a property lien placed on the mobile home. She has wanted to sell the property for a couple of years now because she couldn’t afford it, but was unable to due to her ex not willing to sign off on any sale. Since they were married, she could not legally sell without his consent – even though she paid for the mobile home in cash before they were married and his name is not on the deed.

 
It looks like within the next few weeks she will finally get permission from the court to sell the property. Now, since there is a lien in place she will not be able to sell until the taxes are paid. So we are thinking at this point she will only be able to sell if the buyer is willing to pay cash in advance so that she can turn around and pay the taxes off before signing everything over to the buyer.


She had to vacate the property due to it no longer being safe to live in with her ex breaking a restraining order multiple times and also being arresting for stalking her and showing up unannounced – even going as far as breaking her door down and entering without her permission. We now rent a condo together and her address is confidential, but we have been stuck paying for the rent on the land for her mobile home for the past 7 months. It is getting very difficult for us to afford to pay for two properties and we are essentially living paycheck to paycheck.

 
On top of the money owed for the back taxes, the place also needs a lot of work. Probably about another $8,000-$10,000 at least. At this point she is willing to just cut her losses and sell the property for just enough money to cover the taxes and break even. Just not having to pay for the land anymore would be a win. We have tried selling to private companies that essentially flip mobile homes but the trailer park will only allow her to sell it on the market I guess? We had one person who was ready to buy and then ended up walking away after talking to the park because “they were not going to allow them to do what they had envisioned with the property”


Basically what I am wondering at this point – are there any other options? Will she be stuck paying rent on this land for all eternity? We do not have the cash to fix the place up and sell it on the market or to pay off the taxes. Is bankruptcy an option and if it is how would she go about looking into that? Neither of us have much knowledge or experience in these areas and would greatly appreciate any insight this sub has to offer. I apologize if any of this is confusing and am happy to answer any questions to help clarify things.

Both funds initially held USSPX, but when you reach a certain investment threshold, USSPX shares are converted to USPRX. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can hold USSPX at Vanguard, but I cannot hold USPRX. In the interest of consolidation, I&amp;#39;d like to transfer all of my investments to Vanguard, but I don&amp;#39;t really see how I would make this work. Which usually means I am missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice or consideration would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

So my family has a property in the middle of the U.S. that has been in the family for over 100 years. Every other year the entire family descends on the place and we spend a week together. The generation above me (4 cousins) pays for most of the expenses and upkeep. My generation (14 grandkids 22 to 39 yrs) is wanting to contribute but ownership is complicated and not everyone can contribute the same. 

What I want is to set up an account or fund that all the grandkids can pay into/contribute over the time between reunions. Then like a few months before we visit we'd decide what to spend the money on. 

Is it possible to do something like this? I suppose I could open an online bank account and have people Venmo me money but it seems like there'd be a more anonymous way for the grandkids to contribute and hopefully a way that they would all not have to totally trust one person to manage everything.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any help.&lt;/p&gt;

My mother has recently been diagnosed with dementia. One of the myriad decisions facing us is what to do with her car. She will never drive again. We want to get the car out of her garage soon, because she gets upset when she sees it, and her aid has to remind her that she can't drive. 

We have three possible scenarios for what to do with the car, and would like to hear what y'all think of each. 

1. Ship it to myself, and sell it to myself at fair market (about $13k). I would then sell off one of my cars at around $10k. 

2. Ship it to myself, register it in AR, and get it insured. I drive it indefinitely without selling it. If we still have it when Mom passes away, I would inherit it. She probably has 5-8 years. 

3. Leave it with a relative in CT, who may or may not want to use it. 

**Relevant info. Will add to this if requested.**

- I have a general POA. Not here for legal advice, but this will allow me to sign over the car on her behalf. 

- Car is in registered and located in CT, I am in AR.

- Car is a 2014 Subaru in very good condition. Books around $13k.

- Not sure what the taxes will be in CT, but they are surely much higher than AR. In AR the taxes would be about $150.

I'll try to provide as much info as possible:

My wife and I just got married last year and we filed jointly this year; we owed about $2k.  I've always gotten a refund in the past, but my wife has some investment accounts (handed down from a grandparent) that incur some tax impact each year and we ended up owing the $2k.  Her income is ~$52k and mine was ~$92k.

I was laid off at the end of last year in November and I just landed a new job (starting mid-July).  Wife's salary is still ~$52k; mine will be $115k.  From what I've read, that's a big enough difference that I need to look at this differently and handle accordingly.  We will both have the normal things happening on our bi-weekly paychecks as far as 401(k) deductions.  She is claiming 1 allowance.

After going through the IRS worksheet, I'm coming up with the reco of putting 0 allowances (filing jointly/married) and withholding an additional $331/pay check.  This seems overly aggressive to me and I'd ultimately rather get close to $0 on my tax bill and have a bit more throughout the year on my paycheck (I'm fine with budgeting accordingly and planning to potentially owe a little bit).

My inclination is to put 1 or 2 for the allowances and then withhold a little extra on each check ($100 or so).  Am I way off?  I've always had simple W4's in the past as a single guy and just put 1 and called it a day.  This is driving me insane (I'm clearly not a tax pro) and I don't want to end up with more withheld on my checks than needed throughout the year.

Can a lender report a late payment years later?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a car loan that I am still paying on and today I receive an alert that my credit score decreased because my auto lender reported a 30 day late payment from June 2015, just on my Exquifax. However, this derogatory mark appears on the other two reports and did so in a timely fashion in 2015. When speaking to my lender they completely disregard the time in which it was reported (30 days ago), just focused on the fact that it was accurate. Which is not a problem for me. But my concern is having it impact me as if it was a recent late payment. 

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;Can a lender report a late payment years later?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a car loan that I am still paying on and today I receive an alert that my credit score decreased because my auto lender reported a 30 day late payment from June 2015, just on my Exquifax. However, this derogatory mark appears on the other two reports and did so in a timely fashion in 2015. When speaking to my lender they completely disregard the time in which it was reported (30 days ago), just focused on the fact that it was accurate. Which is not a problem for me. But my concern is having it impact me as if it was a recent late payment. &lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to see how many years of  retirement I would gain if I ignored the safe withdrawal rate - that is  to have a parasitic effect on retirement savings and deplete it right  about the time I expect to die.

A quick note on definitions:

* Financial Independence (FI) means that one can live until death without any additional income.
* *Perpetual* Financial Independence (pFI) means that one can live *perpetually* without any additional income; age 100, age 1000, age inf.
* Safe  Annual Withdrawal Rate means that the principle of the investment  remains unchanged year over year; i.e. that annual percent yield equals  the annual percent withdrawal.

Let me list the assumptions for input data first:

1. Start working at age 22.
2. Age of death is 82.
3. Social  Security (SS) withdrawal starting at age 67, which covers 18% of annual  expenses. Meaning, 82% comes from investment income (e.g. 401k, IRA,  Stocks, Bonds) *after tax.*
4. Annual investment return after inflation of 5%.
5. Safe annual withdrawal rate of 4%

Now,  the assumptions for calculation. The most accurate thing is to show the  formulas, but I want this post to be understood by people that can read  - not necessarily people that can read and are competent at math.

I would first like to claim acknowledgement of my wrong doings over the course of 2 years. My biggest would be making the move +1 hr away from my job. It made sense at the time being that I was given a company vehicle to commute with daily, the gas and toll fees were covered by my job and I was making well over $60000 a year. Today, I am a 28 yr old male trying to get my foot in the door of plumbing apprenticeship although, I haven’t the funds to settle making payments for the program at hand. Over the course of 2 years, I’ve managed to drain what cash I was able to save when working with Pest Control (+$7000) due to living the “toxic couple” lifestyle (I’m now single) amongst other finances and obligations such as car payments and helping family.  The vehicle  (2004 Chevy Malibu LT 6v) I spent 3 years paying off has built issues so problematic it’s worth more to sell it at this point than get repairs done. In current condition, I’m not expecting to get more than $700 for this brick. 

As of now, I make roughly half the income I was making when I was working pest control. ($350/week). I’ve held 2 jobs in that field. The better paying of the two I was fired from due to randomized piss test, and the other I quit when I was falsely accused of doing under the table work. Knowing the owner of this plumbing company for over a decade, I felt my decision for a field change was a logical one. Although my registered technician certification is still valid for another year, I see no ladder for me in the commercial pest control field. Getting the technicians certified isn’t among top their list of priorities and I’m looking to expand my field of expertise and abilities overtime. Where I’m at now, I’ve been offered reimbursement for all expenses involved with the apprenticeship program as long as consistent competence remains present but starting out will be out of pocket. As of now I hold +$700 to my name (including savings) and after getting rid of the brick I should be above $1200. Main objective as of now is getting my hands on a vehicle for commute for I’ve been relying on friends, family and coworkers these past 2 weeks.

So basically, here are my options...
A. Take out a loan to use towards getting a new vehicle (although this may not be an option for I have bad credit)

B. Sell the car/Buy a junker: something cheap I can get my hands on that will run for the next year or 2.

C. Temporarily return to Commercial Pest Control: For 90 days return to Pest Control then leave. I have given this plenty of thought being that it would solve multiple issues involving finances and having a vehicle (issued by job). I’ve been notified already by my old employer who is willing to rehire me on call. 

D. Pick up overnight shifts at my nearest highest paying retail. I only dread the thought of having little to no fatigue living this lifestyle, but will do what’s necessary to prevent further falling under. 

E. I do have talents to offer such as being experienced in music production. I enjoy making beats in my free time and have often considered selling them, however, I haven’t made enough effort into scouting a solid platform I could use to do this. At worst, I could still produce 3 quality beats at a days end. I’m willing to beats $1 a track if I can build a solid base. I understand this option is not practical for a short term resolution 

F. Open for YOUR recommendations!
(Btw moving closer is not an option. I’m locked into my lease for until April 2020)

I would really appreciate any suggestions or feedback even if it’s directing me to another thread! If this isn’t appropriate I can remove as well. 

2 years ago I got a first credit card through Wells Fargo to build my credit. 1 year no interest then I believe 13.40 variable APR. 1500$ spending limit. 

Everything was smooth sailing until I got into a car crash. I had to put 1.2K on the card. I make 800-1200 bi weekly from work.  I was supporting my unemployed SO at the time so I could only pay off 100 at a time max. Then we had to move to a new apartment so I put what I couldn’t afford on the card, still intending to pay it off. As my budget got tighter I could only make the minimum payment. The interest finally broke through the spending limit and my credit score dropped 40 points to 639 and Wells Fargo increased my spending limit to 2000$. My current debt is 1545.91.

My SO Is just now employed again and so now I’m trying to pay off the card. I’m wondering. Should I talk to the bankers at Wells Fargo to help me calculate how much I need to pay each month so get it paid off? Should I take out a loan with a fixed APR to pay it off? Any help and suggestions would be greatly appreciated I don’t spend any money on it and I don’t have any intention of racking up any more credit card debt.

I recently learned that I could use a traditional IRA to pay for my future college expenses and I don't pay the 10% penalty.

I'm planning to increase my 401k contribution dramatically. I'm aware I'll have to pay income tax associated with the withdrawal but that'll be lesser than the tax I'll pay today 22%-24%. I plan to only withdraw below 40k which will be around 12% tax rate. Am I thinking about this the right way? Or am I missing something?

I'm meeting with a financial planner (CFP) tomorrow for my initial (free) consultation (for general financial planning and my retirement). They're a fee-only fiduciary (I know my keywords!), so I think I'm OK on that end, but I want to make the most of the meeting while avoiding any ""traps."" (If traps even exist.)


I'm going in with a full set of balances for all of my accounts (bank, brokerage, retirement) and property values (house &amp; car), as well as my average yearly living expenses (based on year of tracking) and how much I'm able to save each year.


I also have full understanding of where my inheritance currently stands. My father passed away, and my mother is retired, and she gave me the balances and values of all of her accounts and assets, which would eventually be split between my sister and me.


I've already mapped out a retirement horizon given my savings rate, my current income, inflation, estimated 7% average yearly appreciation of investments, and so on.


So, my questions are:

* What should I look out for (traps) when they speak to me / propose anything?

* What are reasonable fees?

* What are smart questions to ask?

* What should I expect to gain from a financial advisor that I'm not already doing?

* Something just feels off, even though I understand the difference between principal and interest in regards to per diem.



* Back in early August 2017, I had been through a 2 year financial whirlwind. I had just come out of it mostly unscathed credit wise (with massive help) and off 90-95% of my debt.



* Having just helped my dad sell my first car ('06 Sonata V6 and sister's '07 Sonata) about 1 week earlier (he used both as beaters), the excitement from doing that overwhelmed me (I get ecstatic after a successful sale) to replace my 2014 Ford Focus ST (sooner than later), which despite owning for almost 3 years, I had quickly gotten tired of it as a daily driver (just after 6-9 months of sole use).



* I had slowly realized the idea to special order a fully loaded 2017 Mustang GT Premium (by ordering deadline of June 30, 2017) was a dangerous, senseless decision and moved to cancel/abandon the order (due Oct/Nov) before the car was built, over delivery delays and wanting to be prudent going forward.



* I instead chose to look for a used $18-25k manual Dodge Challenger R/T in the 2012-14 MY range, but out of curiosity (not seriousness) went to check out a used Raptor at a Lexus dealership. I had previously owned a 2010 Supercab version, which I sold the previous year to a marine and kept my more economical Focus ST.



* Looking at a heavily modded manual 2010 Challenger SRT8 with a heavy clutch pedal (a very high mileage), I had gone from tire kicking on this truck, to be willing to put a down payment of up to $4,000 to secure it.



* I abandoned the approved financing for the Dodge at $26k and stupidly signed for the amount of $848.77 for 72 months at 7.7% APR and a put down payment for the 2014 SVT Raptor Special Edition at 66,196 miles (now has over 90k). My Auto FICO score at the time was 647-650 (dealer claimed 618), which if I was patient, would have swung back well into the 700s. I had paid off nearly $100k in debt, which was executed much of spring 2017 into early August 2017. I stupidly rushed into it, because of perceived rarity of the truck (color, options, last year, etc) and the excitement in being debt free (ironically).



* During financing for the truck, I had asked to even lower the price from $47,888 down to $47,000 and the young finance guy, insisted that his sales manager ""said no"". Stupidly, I didn't walk away and toss the pen.



* I am now trying to sell my truck, but I am puzzled at to why I am upside down so much, as if I never put a penny into it? I am often offered only $30k to trade it in, yet still owe just under $39,000 ($38k+ w/o late charges). Sadly because of other unexpected obligations (I'm trying to pay down), I am now regularly 3 weeks late (not 30 days late), accruing late charges of $43 every month.



* At the time I signed I was being paid over $3,000 per direct deposit, which has halved 2 years later due to downtime.



* I am very aware now it was a very senseless purchase to make, but I don't even know where to start on how to come out under it. In cases where I put $0 downpayment, I understand there being negative equity, but in this case I am puzzled as to why a (allegedly) high resale niche SVT Raptor is a problem to sell, as if no equity was ever put into it. I didn't put 20%, but around 8%.



* I have never missed a payment on it nor have ever been reported to bureaus, which is what I am trying to avoid desperately. Driving this truck always is anxiety-producing, in a feeling of it being too much vehicle and not even suitable for the frequent offroad use or utility I anticipated wanting/needing it for. 


* I feel like I entirely defeated the purpose of reestablishing financial stability which was my intention 2 years ago. I had briefly got stuck with a Nissan Frontier Pro-4X 6MT I hated so much (thankfully got totaled in a T-bone crash after 10 days), which once I came out under it, I was ecstatic to replace it with my ideal non-luxury vehicle. My ideal was a cheaper late model Jeep Wrangler Unlimited (2012), but once that got sold under me, I got upset and went overboard.


* I ironically had never planned on choosing another Raptor, but couldn't find anything else I liked that was refined, some utility, and well equipped. My next choice was a late model Tacoma, but couldn't find any manual 2016-17 TRD V6 examples at a good price (and hated driving position). As I am trying to sell this truck, I feel like I overpaid for it. Taxes were $3,400 at 6.25%, my VSC was $1,661.


**For TL;DR, I will summarize**:

* **Came out of debt in early August 2017**


* Wanted to get another manual, yet refined used car to replace buzzy hot hatch Focus ST(modified).


* On severe impulse, bought a pristine, yet high mileage 2014 SVT Raptor Special Edition for $47,888 before TT&amp;L w/VSC and 8-10% downpayment.



* NADA app retailed it at $47,650 with 66k miles on day of purchase.



* MSRP was $60,060



* Stupidly didn't negotiate price well, plus tires were bald upon purchase and I still also owe money from replacing them at Discount Tire (Synchrony Card) and using card for gas.



* I have paid monthly for it since October 10, 2017 (sale closed on 08/19/17, took it home 8/9/17) at $848.77



* Only skipped one payment (deferment in 2018)



* Current mileage is over 90k, serviced only at Ford dealerships.



* I want to know if I overpaid for this vehicle, which could explain the massive negative equity.**



* Lord knows I mismanaged so much stupidly, but I am trying to balance my budget and get my finances in order, after naively helping out a relative last year and nearly tarnishing my credit (avoided narrowly). I don't want to involve my parents, as I feel that I should fix this mess on my own and they have helped more than enough.



* Aside from my truck, I have high card balances. I want to get rid of this truck and get something simple, so I can pay down my credit card debt. It has been a miracle that I've avoided '30 days late' the past 18 months (and in general). I feel like a failure, in misjudging the situation and always feel agitated/anxiety near this truck.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stupidly didn&amp;#39;t negotiate price well, plus tires were bald upon purchase and I still also owe money from replacing them at Discount Tire (Synchrony Card) and using card for gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have paid monthly for it since October 10, 2017 (sale closed on 08/19/17, took it home 8/9/17) at $848.77&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only skipped one payment (deferment in 2018)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current mileage is over 90k, serviced only at Ford dealerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to know if I overpaid for this vehicle, which could explain the massive negative equity.**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord knows I mismanaged so much stupidly, but I am trying to balance my budget and get my finances in order, after naively helping out a relative last year and nearly tarnishing my credit (avoided narrowly). I don&amp;#39;t want to involve my parents, as I feel that I should fix this mess on my own and they have helped more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from my truck, I have high card balances. I want to get rid of this truck and get something simple, so I can pay down my credit card debt. It has been a miracle that I&amp;#39;ve avoided &amp;#39;30 days late&amp;#39; the past 18 months (and in general). I feel like a failure, in misjudging the situation and always feel agitated/anxiety near this truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Now, these figures don't account for any major life changes like moving, a new job, hospitalizations, having a baby, house projects, or travel. But I feel like I need to be really aggressive in the next few years to accomplish this and if I am, I can get it paid off about 2.5 years. If that means taking a break from extras like nonessential home improvement projects, leisure travel, etc., I might just have to get really disciplined for awhile. I think I can do it. I was going to apply for the Public Service Forgiveness Program but I still have a ways to go and I heard like .01% of applicants even get accepted in the program so I can't hold my breath.

Is this too aggressive? Is it possible? Should I divert more towards my savings/retirement instead of loans? Any advice would be really, really appreciated.

He signed MPNs for a Direct Subsidized Loan and a Direct Unsubsidized Loan to help pay for the year. He attended the university for the Fall 2018 semester, but when he went to register for the Spring semester, he couldn't because apparently his account was not settled for the Fall semester. He made all his payments in full and on-time for the semester, but either his university financial aid or his loans failed to go through because he failed to provide the university with his immunization records (by accident).

&amp;#x200B;

When he realized this in January, prior to the deadline for registration for the Spring semester, he provided the school with his immunization records and waited. His account didn't settle and he was unable to register for that semester. Any attempts he made to contact the school via email went unresponded to. Every time he tried to call the school, he got put on hold and was never put through to talk to an actual person about his situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

He has no intention of going back to the school, and never formally withdrew from the school. He spent the semester working full time, not really knowing where he stood with the school as no one ever contacted him about his enrollment status or finances. He lost access to his student email and has been unable to access his student account to see if he owes the school any money.  Additionally, his federal loans are not listed in the NSLDS. I had him check his credit report with Experian to see if the school tried to go through a collections agency to get anything from him, and there was nothing there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now he wants to go back to college, and we're both a little worried that this situation is going to come back to bite him in the ass. To our knowledge, he does not owe anyone money. He plans to enroll at a different school, and has no intention of trying to retrieve his transcript from his previous university.

I read this sub a lot and wanted your input. I work in sales with commission and will be receiving a very nice check in the next month because of a great quarter. 

Over the last couple years my wife and I have racked up some credit card debt due to relocating back to the USA from overseas and getting established. We have approx. 25k in credit card debt over 3 cards, none are maxed out. Also we have approx. 100k in student loan debt between my wife and I all below 5%, most below 4%. We are looking at possibly purchasing our 1st home as well with some of the commission money I will get. 

I make good money, last year we brought home about 180k gross and this commission check will be around 60k take home after taxes. We have no kids or other debts besides our cars. 

With the 25k in credit card debt I am looking to get a 0% interest card for 18+ months and pay off the balance over that time in order to just keep some liquidity and possibly look at putting a down payment on a house. 

Does this plan make sense? The down payment on a house isn't the most important thing, getting out of debt is. My wife and I are working on our budget as well to ensure we are living within our means but wanted to see if there are hidden or unknown downfalls to a 0% credit card, other then not paying the full balance in time. 

I will have enough cash to pay all credit card debt if I wanted but it seemed smarter to take advantage of my good credit and a 0% interest offer.

I'm not sure how long it will take for him to find a place. I'm strongly considering just getting my own apartment. Little more info on my situation:  

&amp;#x200B;

* I currently work full time (40hrs) and make $15.50/hr. Paychecks are about $450 a week after insurance and 401k.
* I have about $7,000 saved up. 
* Monthly bonus anywhere from $150 - $400
* I have a 401k and put in the most that my employer will match. 
* $80 a month health insurance through employer
* $80 for car insurance
* Have a nice car (2014) with low car payments of $200/month
* Few other bills including spotify ($15/month), netflix ($12/month), iPhone($50/month) 
* 740 credit score, about $500 in credit card debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most apartments near me are around $8-900 for rent. (I could get a place for \~$700 but I'm not sure I want a 30+ minute commute to work.) It seems like I can afford this, but it's hard to know where to begin with budgeting. I also have no idea how much I should expect to pay for utilities. I also feel like if I start renting now I'll never be able to save up enough money to buy a house in the future.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if I'm just being impatient. My friend said he would only charge me about $3-400 for rent and that's obviously the best choice, but I feel like I just can't wait any longer.

I have a friend who plans on buying a house &amp;quot;this summer&amp;quot; but he hasn&amp;#39;t really been looking that hard and hasn&amp;#39;t been pre approved for a loan. I&amp;#39;m not sure how long it will take for him to find a place. I&amp;#39;m strongly considering just getting my own apartment. Little more info on my situation:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I currently work full time (40hrs) and make $15.50/hr. Paychecks are about $450 a week after insurance and 401k.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have about $7,000 saved up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monthly bonus anywhere from $150 - $400&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a 401k and put in the most that my employer will match. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$80 a month health insurance through employer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$80 for car insurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a nice car (2014) with low car payments of $200/month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Few other bills including spotify ($15/month), netflix ($12/month), iPhone($50/month) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;740 credit score, about $500 in credit card debt. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most apartments near me are around $8-900 for rent. (I could get a place for ~$700 but I&amp;#39;m not sure I want a 30+ minute commute to work.) It seems like I can afford this, but it&amp;#39;s hard to know where to begin with budgeting. I also have no idea how much I should expect to pay for utilities. I also feel like if I start renting now I&amp;#39;ll never be able to save up enough money to buy a house in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if I&amp;#39;m just being impatient. My friend said he would only charge me about $3-400 for rent and that&amp;#39;s obviously the best choice, but I feel like I just can&amp;#39;t wait any longer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you guys think? Is it financial suicide to start renting at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

Okay so talked to my debt collector today. This is the third company to have the debt and theyve had it since janurary. The amount is around 2k. They sent me a letter with 1k lump sum offer.
I offered them 800 and the debt collector said I need to accept it today for them to approve it. I told him I need time and he wouldn't even let me get off the phone, wanted me to give the card info today. When I didn't budge he said he will call me back in an hour for the card number.

He said he'll email me the settlement and emailed me a log in to their portal. I logged in and there indeed is a fax cover sheet similar to what I got in mail a few months ago when they extended me a different amount.

My question is this:

Should I make this payment over the phone. I have a written letter from them that says the account is being settled for 800 but I'm still hesitant to make that payment over the phone. I just don't want them to go into my account and take out money later.

I've been using the same credit union for the last 6 years.  I've never had any issues with them until recently.  On June 4, someone used a convenience check in another state to get nearly $600 against my credit card.  This put me into overdraft, which I would think would have prevented it from happening, but the transaction went through.

I reported the fraud when I saw it, within a few days.  I spoke to a rep at the CU and they asked me to  verify some other transactions, which I indicated were all legitimate.  They then filed a fraud report against 3 legitimate transactions and left the fraudulent charge in place.

I called again the next day, and was told they corrected the mistake.  However, the 3 legitimate transactions were refunded to my account and the fraudulent charge remains in place.

At this point I have called and talked to multiple reps, asked for and been transferred management several times.  I even filled out a feedback request and was contacted based on my feedback by someone who assured me they were taking care of it.

Its almost a month later and I still have the nearly $600 charge on my card, + interest they're charging me since it was a cash advance, and the 3 legitimate transactions are still credited to my account.  They sent me a new card, but I haven't used it or even activated it because I don't want to somehow make things worse.

We had some inspections and the house has had some water damage which has led to mold in the kitchen and one of the bathrooms. The plumbing in those areas has been replaced, but the cabinets and the walls have not. The sellers have also never looked into the walls so we don’t know the extent of the damage.  Everything could be fine, or there could be water damage and mold inside the walls and the entire kitchen and kitchen ceiling could have to be replaced. We don’t know.

The house appraised for $5,000 less than we offered and the owners are absolutely refusing to pay for any repairs or to lower the price.

We’re putting down 20% conventional, and we could put down another $5,000 to cover the appraisal set-back, but it would drain our bank account to $4,000. Right now, we would be paying a total of ~$2,800 a month on the house, everything included. Selling price is $435k. Our income is $140k. We’re in California.

Ladies and gents, everything from your power bill to your rent to your credit card payment to your emergency fund to your IRA can be set-up for automated payments and transfers. The simplest of these are the utilities and rent - these are necessities that absolutely have to be paid and paid on time. Next is the credit card payment. Even if you're working on paying down a big balance, and you can't pay off the statement balance every month, set-up that automatic payment for what you CAN pay so that you don't even have to think about it any more (if you're only paying the minumum, i.e. only paying the monthly interest accrual, you should be focusing on how to solve that first and foremost). Automatic disbursal to a HYSA for your E-fund. Automatic deposits and automatic investing with your IRA. You can turn your finances into a well-oiled machine.

I get paychecks bi-weekly, so I have my automated money movements split between the first and second half of the month: pay off CC statement balances, car payment, E-Fund deposit, and IRA deposit at the beginning of the month - student loan, car insurance, utilities etc. the second half. My finances are stable enough that I can budget down to within +/- $50 of what I actually spend between rent, utilities, groceries, gas, allocations, etc. and I am able to leave a few hundred dollars ""extra"" for both small things like a lunch or unexpected small expense as well as for giving me some padding for my automated payments/allocations: if gas or water is suddenly higher one month and ""blows"" what I budgeted for it, it only eats into my buffer.

New profile made just to make this post— been lurking for a while now and have really learned a lot through this community: r/personalfinance. I’ve actually been doing some of the things highlighted here already— but I thought I needed a solid plan to really follow. 

25/F. LCOL. 5 years ago, had no job. Was in school for nursing and lived with my wonderful mom. 
- Graduated three years ago became an RN, first job ever!
- Bought a 2014 Nissan Sentra (paid off). 
- Paid off student loans, total of $13,250 (always maxed out my student loans to give the extra money to my mom).
- Bought a house 4 months ago, valued at $84,500, still owe $66,000. 

The other people in my family are not... very good with money but a very good friend of mine has helped me with financial decisions and has helped me gain some financial stability. Also, due to my family not being very good with money, I had family members borrow money from me (even as a young child), manipulated me to get money, and never paid me back (good note: those family members I have not dealt with anymore). 

Due to all that I became very, very stingy and grew up feeling like I couldn’t spend a single cent for myself and would have to give the money up to some uncle or aunt or whoever else needed help. I am doing better now though and have been able to invest in both my future and myself.

So I would really like to continue this journey and commit to creating a better financial future for myself, my family, and my own future family (whether it be an actual partner and our child, an adopted child, or fur babies).

On to the details! And excuse me if I use certain terms or phrases incorrectly! Still new to to FIRE world and also, English is not my first language! I would greatly appreciate any corrections too!

ASSETS:
- $84,500 house
- 2014 Nissan Sentra w/ 58,000 miles- valued at $5-6,000 on the blue book.
- $30,000 in savings (10,000 is my Emergency Fund).
- 20,000 in my 401K.

I have also just recently put my notice in and am woking on getting a job that will pay more. So I will have more money to invest.

MONTHLY EXPENSES:
- $530 - MORTGAGE 
Question: would it be better to pay that amount or to increase and pay $600 monthly? 
- $70- COMCAST (it was a promo).
- $150- UTILITIES (a modest calculation, just got the home learning NEST thermostat, hoping it will help with the bill!)
- $103 - CAR INSURANCE (new and cheaper than old one.)
- $74- LIFE INSURANCE (new, not with work, will pay out 500,000 at death or age of 100, whichever comes first).
- $50- COUNSELING (something that I have gotten into to help with stress from work and family. Cannot let myself stop this because it has helped me a lot, and I highly recommend it to anyone.)
- $150- GROCERIES (mostly rice, beans, meat, and some snacks. Health, I think is a good investment because hospital bills are ridiculous, saying that as both a nurse and a patient.)
- $100 - TRANSPORTATION (mostly gas, what else should I include?)
- $80 - MARTIAL ARTS/WORKOUT CLASSES
- $100 - DONATIONS


TOTAL: $1,407


Okay. So, details in. Right now I make an average of $3,200 monthly WITH overtime. Working hard to the point that I get sick and exhausted. July is my last month. I am planning on becoming a traveling nurse and expect to make at least $1,200 weekly, total of $4,800 monthly. This job change should increase my expense only with Hotel night stays at decent hotels, either 3-4 nights and more gas usage. I hope my post isn’t all over the place! 

So my questions are:
1. Should I roll over my 401K to a ROTH IRA? 

2. The company I will be working with during traveling has a 401K, but I won’t be able to sign up until after 6 months, and then I am 100% vested right away. They do 100% match up to 3% and 50% match for 4%!
— Does 100% vested right away mean that I IMMEDIATELY get whatever they match? 
— And how much of my paycheck should I put in? The 3% or 4%? The place I currently work at matches 25% of the 6%, and I have been putting in 10%.

3. Many people have suggested Fidelity or Vanguard or Schwab for investments? Unfortunately, I have a hard time understanding some of the risks. Is this a once a year contribution and just let it grow? 

4. Should I get an HSA? Or is there another alternative? I currently have health insurance with the place I work at, and I am planning on switching to Anthem, the one that is provided by the company taking care of my home, auto, and life insurance. 
— if I get health insurance from them too, do you think I can haggle cheaper prices in all as well? 

5. Would it be better to buy new furniture with full payment for the new house or to do payment plans? 

6. How do I calculate how much money I need for retirement?

And... I think that is all I have for now! Thank you all so much for your help! Any suggestions/recommendations are very much appreciated!

ADDED QUESTION:

- I currently have two credit cards. One in a local credit union and one with Wells Fargo. Would it be a good idea to get another one? Or not? 

Thank you!

EDIT:

WOW! I did not expect to get as much attention as it did! I am amazed and grateful! The Reddit community is wonderful!!!

Also:

To answer some of the most asked questions: 

1. I live in one of the smaller cities in Virginia. LCOL. Done pretty well so far.

2. The house I bought is a 3 bedroom house with 1 full and one half bathroom. Nice, hardwood floors. Spacious. With a big basement, half-finished. It’s a good amount of space for one person!

3. Yes, I like to donate and volunteer as much as I can. I try to put as much good energy into the world because hey, life’s hard enough. Also, to counter the sarcastic comments I have a tendency to dish out in my head.

4. One of the best perks of being an RN is being able to find a job anywhere, anytime. I have actually already had two solid offers that I had to turn down because I want to finish my last few weeks and not just go AWOL.

5. I make, on average, $3,200 monthly. This is while working nightshift and with overtime. Unfortunately nurse money, isn’t really big bucks money unless you travel— most times! 

6. My specialty is ICU! I’m an intensive care bear. 

- Yes! I do make... a low amount. Base pay of $23 plus shift differential of $4, $1 weekend differential. $2 charge nurse differential! With overtime— I make about $3,200 to $3,800 monthly... 

7. The life insurance is for my mother in case something happens to me. So she can pay her mortgage, my mortgage, buy the land she wants to retire in. Etc. she has been my rock and my biggest fan. So if I do die, I’d like to leave her with enough to sustain her needs and wants.

Also, I didn’t think I needed life insurance until I— 1. Got into a car accident. 2. Had an anaphylactic reaction one time while I was at work that required me to go to the Emergency Room. Embarrassing. And terrifying.

Thank you all once again! 

— Oh, I also have 3 plants named Wilde, Twain, and Poe (who says I shouldn’t get any more plants, nevermore. But I am not listening to him.) and...

- a BIG, FAT gray cat that comes to my porch and watches me all the time. Completely unfazed. Lays around in the sun and squints at me. It is not my cat, but I do believe I am one of its hyumans.

My friend says I should name him Hobo. What do you guys think I should name him?

(You can go to my profile to see a video of the cat.)

&lt;p&gt;WOW! I did not expect to get as much attention as it did! I am amazed and grateful! The Reddit community is wonderful!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer some of the most asked questions: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in one of the smaller cities in Virginia. LCOL. Done pretty well so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The house I bought is a 3 bedroom house with 1 full and one half bathroom. Nice, hardwood floors. Spacious. With a big basement, half-finished. It’s a good amount of space for one person!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I like to donate and volunteer as much as I can. I try to put as much good energy into the world because hey, life’s hard enough. Also, to counter the sarcastic comments I have a tendency to dish out in my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best perks of being an RN is being able to find a job anywhere, anytime. I have actually already had two solid offers that I had to turn down because I want to finish my last few weeks and not just go AWOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I make, on average, $3,200 monthly. This is while working nightshift and with overtime. Unfortunately nurse money, isn’t really big bucks money unless you travel— most times! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My specialty is ICU! I’m an intensive care bear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes! I do make... a low amount. Base pay of $23 plus shift differential of $4, $1 weekend differential. $2 charge nurse differential! With overtime— I make about $3,200 to $3,800 monthly... &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The life insurance is for my mother in case something happens to me. So she can pay her mortgage, my mortgage, buy the land she wants to retire in. Etc. she has been my rock and my biggest fan. So if I do die, I’d like to leave her with enough to sustain her needs and wants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I didn’t think I needed life insurance until I— 1. Got into a car accident. 2. Had an anaphylactic reaction one time while I was at work that required me to go to the Emergency Room. Embarrassing. And terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all once again! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Oh, I also have 3 plants named Wilde, Twain, and Poe (who says I shouldn’t get any more plants, nevermore. But I am not listening to him.) and...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a BIG, FAT gray cat that comes to my porch and watches me all the time. Completely unfazed. Lays around in the sun and squints at me. It is not my cat, but I do believe I am one of its hyumans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend says I should name him Hobo. What do you guys think I should name him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You can go to my profile to see a video of the cat.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— I HAVE READ ALL THE COMMENTS AND HAVE TRIED TO RESPOND TO AS MANY AS I CAN! Thank you all so much! I am so grateful! —&lt;/p&gt;

My Wife passed away last Thanksgiving Day. As spring came, and her garden began to bloom it was selling or burn it time (selling the house or burn the garden, I am not an animal). I expect to clear $80,000 in a few weeks. I am renting now so I have a year to consider my options. I am 57. I expect to work full-time until at least 65. My tolerance for risk is very low. I am looking for advice not actual suggestions, if that is ok. Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Wife passed away last Thanksgiving Day.

I recently found out that they won't be able to pay in full but only pay $5k per calendar year.

I'm enrolled for school to start in the fall and I'm now faced with the decision if I should take on the debt of the MBA program at this current school or look around in the area for a less expensive school. I don't want to do it online as my house is kind of busy I'd like to do something in person.

I'm 5 years out of undergrad and I do feel like it's the right time to go back to school for my masters to accelerate my career; but I was very much looking forward to having it paid for in full and I'm a little rattled as the full cost of tuition is \~60k. I think the degree will help me make more money and pay off my loans but of course there is no gaurantee where I will end up.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional info

\-I still owe 23k in school loans from undergrad.

\-320k mortage on the house (purchased last year)

\-car is paid off and no other debt is owed (only paying regular utilities on monthly basis)

\-total household income (between my wife and I) is 100-115k
