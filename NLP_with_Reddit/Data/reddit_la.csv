So, I own a condo in South Carolina that I like to AirBnB for some extra income when it’s not being used. Recently, I rented the condo out to a family of 3. Dad and mom were around 45 and daughter was 18. 

As a kind gesture, I typically get the cleaning people to set out a bottle of wine with a note for the incoming guests. In 2+ years of doing this, I’ve never had a problem with doing so. Until now. 

I got a call from the dad, infuriated, 2 nights ago. The dad told me that his daughter took the wine from off the counter and took liquor out of my hidden liquor cabinet to drink with friends. Turns out she doesn’t quite know her limits, and she about drank herself into a coma. 

Daughter had to take a trip to the hospital where she had her stomach pumped and was treated for other complications from the alcohol. 

So dad tells me on the phone that he would like compensation from ME for the medical bills from his daughter’s mistakes. He stated that I was responsible for it by putting out alcohol. He said that if I don’t agree to do so, he will sue me for it.

I think this claim is absurd. Yes, I put out alcohol, but I thought it was pretty understood that only people *of age* should be drinking it. I would’ve understood if the wine was left on the bed of the kids room, but it was on the kitchen counter with a note addressing the parents.

While I think the claims have no ground, the laws might disagree. I need to know: can I get in trouble for this? What do I need to do if so?

Edit: Thanks for the helpful replies everyone. Many of you are suggesting that I file a police report for the stolen liquor. I learned today that this isn’t an option as renters are allowed to use all consumables in an AirBnB regardless of where they are. At this point, I’m not going to mess with the missing liquor. I’m just trying to avoid a lawsuit at all costs. If that means losing a bottle of nice liquor, that’s fine.

Also, I’ll be sure to update you guys as this situation progresses.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, I’ve got a bit of a weird one.&lt;/p&gt;

I won't get into the details too much, but there were 3 individuals in the at fault vehicle that appeared to be traveling 10-20mph over the speed limit (40mph). They ended up crossing over the centerline and getting stuck on that side by a small median. The vehicle looked like it made an attempt to jump the median by swerving back towards it when it impacted an oncoming vehicle at which point it did jump the median and both vehicles collided with us.

The driver and one passenger fled the scene on foot, but were caught on Wednesday night. Unfortunately for the third passenger, they left her in the car and it caught fire in 2-3 minutes after the accident. She died of smoke inhalation.

To our knowledge and what has been reported it sounds like all 3 passengers were minors. The only reported age was under 15 so it's hard to say whether or not they had a permit or license. My guess is no because if you've driven the area where this occurred you'd know there are medians on and off along that stretch of road.

We went to the hospital to get checked out as well as the two other passengers who weren't at fault and in much worse condition.

I was desperate and just wanted to eat, but am now in a much better position in life and have excelled in my position while considerably improving the company itself. The pay is still well below the market rate for my position, but the environment is friendly, I have a lot of lee-way and enjoy my job. I have been told there is no budget to bring my position within normal market rates but have received nominal small raises as recognition for my work and have had consistently positive reviews and have reached or exceeded all milestones.

About 4 months ago, my company's largest competitor in a different country (but with overlap into our region) has posted a job opening for my exact position and credentials, but with 5x the pay (slightly over market value). If I applied, I would likely have a very good chance of getting the position. The problem is my current company had me sign a fairly standard non-compete, non-disclosure agreement which mentions not working for competitors 'for the duration of this contract'. I'm having a hard time understanding the legalese in the contract so am wondering how binding non-competes are and whether it's worth the risk? Is there an online (reputable) service where I can ask someone to look at my contract for this limitation for a small fee?

If I apply, the company would obviously know I'd worked for one of their competitors, would this be an automatic rejection? The job requires prior knowledge of our exact industry and it's a pretty small pool, so I'm curious how else I would achieve this experience without having worked for a competitor. Should I tell them I may have a non-compete/non-disclosure?

tl;dr: currently working extremely poorly compensated but a much better paying position is open with a competitor, how much of an issue is my non-compete/non-disclosure and should I even bother?

Here's the back-story. Wife and I are in the process of purchasing a house in NY state. We had a local + large septic company come through and perform a thorough inspection of the septic system (including the use of a digital camera probe to snake through the various parts). Of the areas inspected, EVERYTHING failed. The distribution box was so full of roots they could not get the probe any further to inspect the laterals. Current homeowner was there during the inspection and was understandably shocked by the results. She hired a separate company from well outside the area to come in and perform a CONSIDERABLY less thorough inspection where everything passed.

Now what? Does one inspection carry more weight than another? Is this just a negotiating tactic? Has anyone dealt with something like this before? 

Any advice moving forward would be very helpful. I'm happy to provide any further details that might be helpful. A couple other items popped up during inspection that we will also be using during this negotiation phase. Thanks.

EDIT - Negotiations are likely to begin in earnest on Monday. So far only inspection results and estimates for repair have been presented to each other. My current thoughts are to ask both septic inspectors back to the site to further inspect the system (specifically, the distribution box and its connection to laterals). This would force the owner's guy to do a more thorough investigation while also opening up a part of the system for our guy to get a better look. Either way, this would provide more information for both parties and more comfort / confidence moving forward with $$ negotiations.

Originally, my uncle owned a large plot of land neighboring my family's property, sold the land to a family ""friend"" (very much in quotes) who built a house there, and held the mortgage on the land with a contract at 5% interest. 

When my uncle passed away in 2007, my father--to a fault a generous, understanding, and rather financially naive man, as you will see--inherited the mortgage note. This is where the problems start.

The friend continued paying on the principal until 2009, then gave my dad a story about financial troubles, and continued paying only the interest until 2013...when he stopped paying entirely. All the while promising he'd pay when he could, of course. (For what it's worth, the friend has been employed and living lavishly all this time, huge house, multiple nice cars, hired landscapers every week...he is definitely taking brazen advantage, not a struggling but genuine guy fallen on hard times. Meanwhile my dad is working himself to death in manual labor and living modestly. Yes, this situation really grinds my gears.)

I only found out about the whole thing yesterday and looked up the New Jersey statute of limitations on debt, which appears to be 6 years. Since the friend continued paying interest biannually (February and August, last payment Feb 2013), the first lapsed payment should be six years ago this August as I understand it. 

What I can't seem to find out is...what could happen at that point? Could the entire six-figure debt potentially just be wiped away? My father does still hold the deed to the land since the mortgage wasn't paid off yet--he couldn't lose that, right?

During this next month, what should we be doing? Could we have the contract redrawn or something? I'm encouraging my father to hire a real estate lawyer. He still believes the family friend has good intentions and ""he'll get paid eventually"" and doesn't want to cause a confrontation or burn any bridges. I'm concerned the friend never intends to pay and is just waiting for the statute of limitations to lapse so my father's legal options will be limited.

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, I bought a used iPhone XR on Facebook Marketplace. I met a husband and wife at a local coffee shop and exchanged pleasantries. The husband works for the same large company as I do, and the wife works for a local hospital. I later looked up the husband in my employee directory, and he is who he says he is, they're not making any efforts to conceal their identities. I tried the SIM card in my phone and it worked with no issues, I pay them.

The phone used to be active on Sprint, but it was (according to them) purchased outright, so it should work with all US carriers. I am on AT&amp;T.

Fast forward to yesterday, and the new phone loses network access and stops working. I called AT&amp;T support on my Fiancee's phone, and they told me that the device was reported lost or stolen, and there was nothing they could do to bring it back online. I ran a report on the device, and it was reported as ""Ever blacklisted"", but not ""Currently blacklisted"" by a reputable phone checking service. I did check the SN/IMEI when I bought the phone and it was all clear. I even put the SIM card back into my original phone, and it doesn't work there now either.

Frustrated, I contacted the sellers again, and they have been very responsive, claiming that they never reported the device lost or stolen, and reaffirming that the device was owned wholly by them with no payment plan on it at the time of its sale to me. They sent me transcripts of chats with Sprint support, affirming that they do not have any outstanding holds on the device. That's all well and good, but I still am not able to use my new phone as intended. AT&amp;T says the issue is not on their end, so they can't do anything about it, but Sprint says there is no issue at all, so they can't do anything. This is maddening.

The phone's serial number and IMEI were published in the original Facebook marketplace ad, is it possible that someone else reported this device lost or stolen for a laugh? I know that seems like a wild theory, but I'm just trying to figure out how I got into this situation.

I know that many will say, ""They're scamming you!"", but it seems so unlikely that someone scamming me would use their real Facebook page, their real names, continue to talk to me after the fact, and tell me that they work for the same company as me when I could easily look up where he works and go to his desk at the office.

&lt;p&gt;Anyways a pressure washing crew came by last month to clean all the driveways and they used the spigot outside my house as the center ground for the entire neighborhood so my water was constantly running for over five hours.  When I asked them if they can use another house they said it’s easier to use mine and my water bill will be fine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well this month was water bill was $50 more than the average and nearly almost matched my entire electrical output for the month.  My townhouse only has me and one other person, and we only take one shower a day so I can’t imagine it being anything else but this incident.  &lt;/p&gt;

TLDR at the bottom!*

When we first met 3 years ago, my SO was working on a book about his experiences in a niche field of work but couldn't find a good writer for the job.

As a writer myself I offered to write it - plus 3 more mini ebooks - as well as design the cover, format it (with an app, nothing crazy), find sales channels, market it, etc. Basically, I agreed to do everything because it made me happy. I wasn't great at marketing it but it has sold $2k+ in gross profit regardless, which is not a lot, I know, but it means that I personally earned over $1000.

I know this because I have access to, and keep track of, our sales channels.

When we first self-published it, we agreed that the money we earned would just stay in my SO's business account as a ""rainy day"" or vacation fund. We also agreed in a text that it was a 50-50 split for all gross revenue - that has been the only written agreement but it's been a verbal agreement as well. We also agreed to my name being on the cover along with his name to further claim my involvement, and I am officially listed as the co-author on all our sales channels.

Eventually I became a stay at home mother with zero income. Money got VERY TIGHT. I remembered my 50% portion and realized it would actually wipe out all my credit card debt and then I wouldn't have to worry about that, at least.

When I asked my SO about taking out my portion, he said it was all gone - almost laughing, as if I should've already known this. He used all our gross revenue to pay bills without my knowledge, all of which I did not consent to. He never once asked me if I was ok with this usage of the money, he just went ahead and used all the revenue in any way he saw fit.

The reason I didn't know about this right away: I had set up his business S-Corp account on the book sales channels thinking it would be used strictly for collecting our profit but apparently he uses that for personal checking purposes, too. So the money got mixed in with that, was never separate from his own finances, etc. This means that my half of the money has gone to a number of extremely expensive monthly payments, and a car lease of his that's $1400/month.

I am furious. Weirdly, so is he - he thinks I should be ok with not seeing a dime of this money since it helps ""pay for my life."" He's not wrong, it helps, but I never got to consent to HOW it would help us. He justifies a lot of this in pointing out that he gave me a credit card tied to his accounts - but I am only to use this for necessities like groceries, so it's not really the same thing as having money to do with what you wish. Plus, I can't use that card to pay off my own credit card - my original intent.

I have $20 in my bank account and my SO knows this. I am looking for work but it's even tougher with a baby, and that money could've really helped me since our finances are separate and my SO does not invite me to make any financial decisions, budgets, etc. (clearly)

**My question: Is this considered theft? Can I sue my SO for essentially failing to pay me for my work?**

We are unmarried so maybe that actually simplifies it - it was a project with an agreement and I just didn't get paid. My SO claims I'm getting ""paid"" by staying home and not working, and being ""provided for.""

I mean... I guess I kind of understand? It still doesn't sit well with me.

I'm organizing my exit from this mess of a relationship but I don't know what kind of law this falls under since a child is now involved. I've thought about getting an IP lawyer to help sort it out but maybe family law would be needed too? I also don't have any money, obviously, so I'm at a loss.

Oddly enough, my SO was recorded in an assets separation case against his ex-wife in a deposition as saying that I wrote the books and that half of the money goes to me. My name being on the book was discussed, too, as well as the fact that it implies my 50% ownership in these book projects.

That only further cements the fact that he blatantly violated our simple 50-50 agreement, correct? I can prove with bank statements that zero money has ever gone to me, I have the text saying it's supposed to be 50-50 as well as my texts to him about being concerned that I would not see my half of the money, etcetera.

Thank you for any advice.

**TL;DR: I did a ton of writing work for my SO and I never saw my half of the profit. SO justifies this in saying that it all goes toward bills that pay for my living expenses since money is really tight right now, but I never consented to or agreed to this arrangement.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit - title got a little funky, can&amp;#39;t change it. TLDR at the bottom!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first met 3 years ago, my SO was working on a book about his experiences in a niche field of work but couldn&amp;#39;t find a good writer for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a writer myself I offered to write it - plus 3 more mini ebooks - as well as design the cover, format it (with an app, nothing crazy), find sales channels, market it, etc. Basically, I agreed to do everything because it made me happy. I wasn&amp;#39;t great at marketing it but it has sold $2k+ in gross profit regardless, which is not a lot, I know, but it means that I personally earned over $1000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this because I have access to, and keep track of, our sales channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first self-published it, we agreed that the money we earned would just stay in my SO&amp;#39;s business account as a &amp;quot;rainy day&amp;quot; or vacation fund. We also agreed in a text that it was a 50-50 split for all gross revenue - that has been the only written agreement but it&amp;#39;s been a verbal agreement as well. We also agreed to my name being on the cover along with his name to further claim my involvement, and I am officially listed as the co-author on all our sales channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I became a stay at home mother with zero income. Money got VERY TIGHT. I remembered my 50% portion and realized it would actually wipe out all my credit card debt and then I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to worry about that, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked my SO about taking out my portion, he said it was all gone - almost laughing, as if I should&amp;#39;ve already known this. He used all our gross revenue to pay bills without my knowledge, all of which I did not consent to. He never once asked me if I was ok with this usage of the money, he just went ahead and used all the revenue in any way he saw fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn&amp;#39;t know about this right away: I had set up his business S-Corp account on the book sales channels thinking it would be used strictly for collecting our profit but apparently he uses that for personal checking purposes, too. So the money got mixed in with that, was never separate from his own finances, etc. This means that my half of the money has gone to a number of extremely expensive monthly payments, and a car lease of his that&amp;#39;s $1400/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am furious. Weirdly, so is he - he thinks I should be ok with not seeing a dime of this money since it helps &amp;quot;pay for my life.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s not wrong, it helps, but I never got to consent to HOW it would help us. He justifies a lot of this in pointing out that he gave me a credit card tied to his accounts - but I am only to use this for necessities like groceries, so it&amp;#39;s not really the same thing as having money to do with what you wish. Plus, I can&amp;#39;t use that card to pay off my own credit card - my original intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have $20 in my bank account and my SO knows this. I am looking for work but it&amp;#39;s even tougher with a baby, and that money could&amp;#39;ve really helped me since our finances are separate and my SO does not invite me to make any financial decisions, budgets, etc. (clearly)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question: Is this considered theft? Can I sue my SO for essentially failing to pay me for my work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are unmarried so maybe that actually simplifies it - it was a project with an agreement and I just didn&amp;#39;t get paid. My SO claims I&amp;#39;m getting &amp;quot;paid&amp;quot; by staying home and not working, and being &amp;quot;provided for.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean... I guess I kind of understand? It still doesn&amp;#39;t sit well with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m organizing my exit from this mess of a relationship but I don&amp;#39;t know what kind of law this falls under since a child is now involved. I&amp;#39;ve thought about getting an IP lawyer to help sort it out but maybe family law would be needed too? I also don&amp;#39;t have any money, obviously, so I&amp;#39;m at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, my SO was recorded in an assets separation case against his ex-wife in a deposition as saying that I wrote the books and that half of the money goes to me. My name being on the book was discussed, too, as well as the fact that it implies my 50% ownership in these book projects.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 18M and have autism, but a good job, education, and a place to go (college dorm), to which my parents are preventing me from moving to.

They've always been controlling people. My dad used to spank me with his belt (really fucking hurt), and both gave me homeopathic medicine and essential oils when I was sick, and monitor my computer and phone use because they believed I need to be monitored from porn and ""misinformation"". They also forced Christianity on me and punished me if I resisted. And they wanted to hold my hand every step of the way in me growing up because they believed because I have autism, I'm more immature than most and need to be disciplined.

They didn't even want me to dorm at the bigger state college campus and go to the smaller one because ""I couldn't handle the big campus"". No, I believe it's so they can keep me under their roof and force their ""my house my rules"" shit on me. They wouldn't even let me drive until I turned 18 last year (they DID let me learn, but again, autism).

I've recently applied to college, and they accepted, and my parents were very proud but I sensed that they were also a bit dismayed that I applied to the larger campus. I've also secured a good job and am able to transfer to one of the company's offices near my campus.

Yesterday, my dad went on my computer and found out I'm trying to dorm against their will. My parents then sat me down and told me about how I wasn't supposed to dorm, let alone go to the bigger campus. I told them I'm 18 and allowed to do what I want by now, but they're like ""We're your parents, and what we say goes regardless of your age, as long as you live in our house you will abide by our rules."" And with that they took the keys to my car and my license and parked theirs behind mine so I can't get out.

I then went back on my computer to type this and found out they're trying to get a court appointment to obtain legal guardianship of me and to use my autism to justify it.

I don't want to live in my parents' house anymore. I'm tired of their controlling and policing.

I am 17 years old, and after three months of working at Subway I still have not received any sort of official break at my work, such as an unpaid 30 minute break for working more than 5 hours. I have worked 8 hour shifts and have not had any break.

On my first day of work, I asked my coworkers how breaks work and they laughed and said we don't get breaks. If we want to ""rest"" for a few minutes in the back, we have to interrupt that resting period to help customers if any walk up wanting to buy something. The only time I get uninterrupted breaks, such as a ten minute break, is if a coworker agrees to watch the front of the store for me. However, I have worked alone for hours at a time before, causing me to not be allowed any break during that time. So, I get to have a short break at times, but no 30 minute breaks at all.

On top of this issue I am having with breaks, I work alone sometimes and there is also a minor here (17 years old) who opens and closes the store by themself and who was made a supervisor. I am wondering how legal this is as well and if it is legal for the manager to be letting minors work alone. My Subway is located in a mall, so I am not sure if that makes a difference or not regarding those two things.

We only have 6 workers total at my work, 5 of which are minors and one is 18, and none of us receive breaks during our shifts. It causes everyone to always be tired and irritated. So, I am wondering, is this legal? Also, is it legal to leave minors working alone as well as open and close alone in a mall? It is hard for me to find information online about these things.

Also, if any of these things are illegal, what steps should I take to stop it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in Washington State and am working as a &amp;quot;Sandwich-Artist&amp;quot; at Subway. I am 17 years old, and after three months of working at Subway I still have not received any sort of official break at my work, such as an unpaid 30 minute break for working more than 5 hours. I have worked 8 hour shifts and have not had any break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first day of work, I asked my coworkers how breaks work and they laughed and said we don&amp;#39;t get breaks. If we want to &amp;quot;rest&amp;quot; for a few minutes in the back, we have to interrupt that resting period to help customers if any walk up wanting to buy something. The only time I get uninterrupted breaks, such as a ten minute break, is if a coworker agrees to watch the front of the store for me. However, I have worked alone for hours at a time before, causing me to not be allowed any break during that time. So, I get to have a short break at times, but no 30 minute breaks at all.&lt;/p&gt;

A few months back, I woke up to cops outside my apartment calling my phone, telling me my motorcycle was pushed over. I went outside and sure enough, it was purposely pushed over by somebody and on its way down scraped the car in the next parking spot. 

The cops logged this as criminal mischief with no suspect, and that was that. The car owner took my number but I didn't hear back for a couple weeks. When he did decide to call me, he told me his insurance wouldn't cover it and he wanted me to pay. I asked him for his insurance info first and when I called the company, they said there was never any indication they wouldn't pay, and he specifically opted out of insurance coverage. 


I text him about this and he responded, saying he didn't want to pay the deductible because it wasn't worth it, and wanted me to pay instead. His quote was about $900. I don't have that money, nor do I feel it's my responsibility to pay. As a friend said it-'if somebody stole your baseball bat and beat somebody else with it, you wouldn't be charged with assault just because it was your bat.' 
However, I do want to double check where I am here because he texts me often saying he's going to take me to court and escalate this and blah blah.

 I previously posted here about my roommates who are a couple (26f) &amp;amp; (18f) who constantly fight to the point where holes have been smashed into walls, bruises appear on each of them the next day, the yelling is so loud I’m honestly shocked my neighbors haven’t called the cops on us yet. 

In that post I went into detail about how my I’m basically being held hostage because my apartment community wouldn’t let me out of the lease unless I had a police report. I called the police who advised they could not make a report unless a victim comes forward and I was not considered a victim in situations where they were being physically violent to each other.  One of them would have to come forward and we’ll, they’re dating so that isn’t going to happen.


 Today at approx. 2:00pm after a heated text conversation about my not wanting to live with my two other roommates due to their constant arguing, damage to property and theft of my own property, the 18f year old ran from a neighbors apartment where she &amp;amp; her 26f year gf (they are both my roommates)had been hanging out. She runs out and slammed a hole into my bedroom window... all because I THREATENED to call the police on her gf for providing alcohol to a minor if they wouldn’t agree to let me out of this lease. So. She. Smashed.my.window. 
Shattered glass ALL over my puppy’s home. Luckily, I had a blanket cover his cage so he is fine....

After breaking my window, she then ran to the front door, rushed into our home and put her hands on both me and a visitor (24m)I had over. We both pushed her off of us.. (18f is also 5’11 and weight about 240lbs.. she a big girl) and retreated to my bedroom. I was in fear for my safety and immediately called 911. When The officers arrived they gave zero shits about the destruction to my window. They only offered only to issue EVERYONE with assault charges and stated we could dispute it in court. Apparently 18f stayed my visitor had hit her in the face which is absolutely false. 

I repeatedly begged “but my window!?” “I have blood on my chest and scratches!” 

He told me there was nothing he could do about the window because he it was 18f’s window also. What!? I literally was on the advised by 911 dispatch to get away from them as they yelled and screamed at me in the house but some how I am not a victim because they stated they weren’t there!? 
 Is this legal!?



I have a clean record and risking a assault charge was in no way an option for me. I did, however, after crying like a baby about how these apartments won’t release me because I am the only one with income in the house therefor my two shitty roommates do not have proof of income to show they can sustain this apartment themselves. 

After crying and explains all this to police officer finally a second officer gave me his card with a police report # attached. He stated it would be a small report about everything that transpired, including their false statements of me and my guest attacking 18f. I’m planning on taking this the leasing manager first thing tomorrow morning at office opening.

My question is... previously everyone on here advised me to call the police every time a incident with my roommates occurred. But with what happened today... I feel like I almost caused myself more harm than good by almost getting an assault charge. 

TLDR; roommates are abusive, steal from me and I’m trying to get out of my lease but my apartment won’t let me without a police report. One of them smashed my window open and I called the cops, cops said all they could do is issue everyone assault charges since they were here to see what happened. How do I get out of this lease if this is the result when the cops are called and did the police really do all that they could have? 18f wasn’t even given a breathalyzer and I had told them my other 26f roommate feeds her alcohol as a desperate attempt to get something documented for me to get out of this lease","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, this one is a long one-

United States

Background:

I used to travel quite frequently for work, and when I moved back to the area, I had no furniture and basically only needed a room to rent. I found this roommate(let’s call her R) on Craigslist, and at the time, she was living in another house with another person and they were seeking a third roommate. It quickly became apparent that the house was basically R’s, and that the other roommate and I were only renting rooms. 

R and I basically both kept to ourselves for most of that time we lived in that house (about 8 months). When the lease ended, R and I found a new place and signed a lease together. We split the security deposit. 

Things were not by any means ideal in the new house, and sharing a bathroom + space with R was an adjustment. I was still traveling semi-regularly for work during the first year, and so it was basically a place to crash. 

R has always enforced this idea that it isn’t my house — she frequently just tells me that her friends, family members, and/or her partner are coming to stay at our house for extended periods of time - her partner will come stay for a month about 2-3 times a year. I have only received payment on bills for this one time during this time, during the first year of the lease (which made me think maybe it will happen every now and then — but it doesn’t). I have brought it up more than once. 

About 2 months after we re-signed the lease for this year and I started a new job with different hours, I was around more frequently, and we began to not get along.
Since this time there have been several clashes due to living styles and cleanliness levels, and I have been extremely uncomfortable in the home — because I feel like no space there is mine, except my room, and that I have paid 1/2 of bills and rent for 1 room so that one of my roommate’s friends etc can basically live there for free 1/3 of the time. I also feel like R feels as though she is being fair. 

Because of these feelings and my uncomfortableness there, I have been spending most of my time at my boyfriend’s house during the last 6 months. I only cook at his house also, so I don’t use the kitchen at my roommate’s house other than the fridge for storage.

I moved out 1 month and 2 weeks early, with the intention of getting someone to sublet my room. I cleaned my room very well, and I cleaned the cabinet and shelves in the kitchen that I used for storage. I cleaned the areas of the bathroom that I kept my stuff. All of this stuff is move-out levels of cleanliness.

Since I moved out, R has resigned the lease. There is one month until the end of our lease and I have paid the rent for this month while living in my new place. I have to go back to the house and pick up some cleaning supplies.

Because R is staying, I agreed to do a walkthrough with her of (what I planned to be) my areas of inhabitance... since agreeing to this walkthrough, R has texted me multiple times insisting that I help her “spring clean” the entire house (something she never did when I lived there). She believes that even areas that contain none of my stuff and that I haven’t used ever or in months are my responsibility -  Like she actually expects me to move her furniture and kitchen items and clean underneath them. I have indulged some of this in the entryway I used, because I have a dog and there was hair to clean. I also wiped the baseboards and a few other things, but I consider this to be enough. 

When I moved into the old house, only the areas I was moving into were move in ready. She’s insisting on cleaning the entire house before even showing it to anyone, and at this point I have basically decided I would rather not even try to get someone to sublet just because I don’t want to deal with her. It’s gotten to the point that she is nagging me and insisting that it’s my responsibility to split these duties with her or to hire someone and split the costs.

Here’s an actual text she sent: “I re-signed the lease with Orange so I’ve got a couple folks lined up that want to see the place (one who would like to move in sooner than later). But of course i won’t show it until the whole house has been thoroughly cleaned. I’ve continued working on it over the weekend but it still has a long way to go. Do you have an idea when you’ll be back to help with more cleaning? Alternatively I know a woman looking for cleaning work and I can hire her and we could split the cost if you prefer”

All of the areas she’s talking about cleaning are areas that were made dirty by her and her many guests. I refuse to do any more work or to pay any more money.

I am still supposed to do a walkthrough, but I feel as though she’s going to try to ask me to do excessive things and it could escalate. I have taken photos of the communal areas I cleaned “before” and I do have a list of the stuff I did.

I’m also worried she is going to try to screw me on the security deposit if I don’t help her clean her mess, because she’s still living there. 


tl;dr: I moved out early because of a dirty, inconsiderate roommate. I agreed to a walkthrough of (what I thought) was my areas of inhabitance. Since this agreement, my old roommate is insisting I come and help clean up their mess and walkthrough the entire house. 

I paid the security deposit to a rental company, but because she re-signed the lease they are considering it a renewal and want the money to stay in trust. Basically, they told me that a roommate normally pays the other roommate 1/2 of the security deposit when the other moves out... R is obviously trying to force me to clean etc. due to this, because she knows she is in control of the money. However, all the stipulations of my lease with the rental company have been met, and she is trying to hold me to her own rules to receive my $. I have talked to the rental company but I have to wait to talk to someone else on Monday. I told R I would be back this week to finish some stuff up, but I’m not going back until I speak to the landlord.

Have I met my legal obligations? Is the landlord allowed to do this with the money? It seems illegal that they would give a random person control over another person’s security deposit.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little at a loss on what to do in this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in May, I decided to switch from ATT postpaid plan to a prepaid one. Somewhere along the lines, something got messed up. Apparently, they had been continuing to charge me for data even though the original postpaid account should have been closed. Now I have a bill of $1200 that I have no idea how to pay. I have tried contacting them since I first got notification about the bill, but I have just been getting the run around ever since then. I got a letter in the mail that I'm on my final notice and that the account would be sent to collections fairly soon. They keep telling me that the charges are valid and that there is basically no way of reversing them, so I guess I'm going to have to figure out some way of paying it even though I never got any notice or bill that I was still being charged after I switched my account to prepaid.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on increasing my credit score as of late and have been doing fairly well, getting it to almost 700. And I've heard that collections can seriously ruin that and any decent chances at a good score. I'm 23 and will be graduating college in two more years, so I don't want something major that would affect my chances in the future. I stumbled upon LendingClub while browsing CreditKarma and was wondering if a personal loan is a good route to take instead of maxing out the pair of credit cards that I do have.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23 from Georgia, I bring in about $1000 a month. I have car payments at $230 (about $7000 remaining on the loan) and a phone bill at $60. I suppose I could also use the loan to pay off my remaining credit card debt &lt;$1500 too, but I'm not really sure what is a good route to take. I bank with Wells Fargo and Navy Fed (prior military) if either of those provides better loan options.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

My current situation is this:

A sister of mine borrowed money months ago close to the beginning of the year, and had said she would pay me back once she started her new job in January, so I thought I would be nice and help her out. The problem being she asked for $1500, and I am a broke college student, so that was a decent amount of my own savings. A couple months after that, she calls me up and asks for more money. Again, stupid me says sure, because she told me she would have it back to me in two days after she got paid, she just needed it that day for a down-payment on something. I paid her $2000 in total, and about a week later I texted her to ask if she had ever made a transfer back to my account, and she just never replied.

Is there anything legal I can do about this?

Any advice is welcome and much appreciated

&lt;p&gt;My current situation is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sister of mine borrowed money months ago close to the beginning of the year, and had said she would pay me back once she started her new job in January, so I thought I would be nice and help her out. The problem being she asked for $1500, and I am a broke college student, so that was a decent amount of my own savings. A couple months after that, she calls me up and asks for more money. Again, stupid me says sure, because she told me she would have it back to me in two days after she got paid, she just needed it that day for a down-payment on something. I paid her $2000 in total, and about a week later I texted her to ask if she had ever made a transfer back to my account, and she just never replied. I still haven&amp;#39;t talked to her since (so a few months at this point) but she maintains regular contact with our father, not our mother, because she owes her money too. Is there anything legal I can do about this?

My 1 1 month old recently had a routine surgery.  Because they can’t eat after midnight on the day of surgery, he was scheduled at 6:30am to get it over with asap.  So, it was an early morning without much sleep the night before.  My husband and I were nervous about the surgery and really unable to focus on much else.

I nearly fell out of my seat.  We have pretty good insurance and I had expected it to be closer to $300.00.  I was holding an upset baby and honestly not able to take it all in.

1.  I am not in the habit of getting speeding tickets, but isn't having a week between ticket and trial a bit... fast?  I thought the process took more like a month.

2.  I just started a new job, so I don't get paid until the 16th.  What do I do to set up a payment arrangement? Just call the court? I live a few hours away, so showing up isn't exactly feasible.  Do traffic players take payment arrangements? Do they generally require payment before, or after court?

Also, the fine amount isn't on the ticket, and I cannot find it on the court's website.  Any ideas on how much I owe?

It's pretty long but I would definitely appreciate the responses. I am located in San Jose, CA. I have an issue that has repeated itself. I have the right to believe that the restaurant I’m working at right now has a manager that has been stealing tips from the employees. It's a chain restaurant like Cheesecake Factory or Maggiano's. I currently work as carry-out aside from the other duties I do but that is my main job at the moment. The way I believe tips were stolen were set through the system. I currently work as carry-out and in the pantry but this will concern the carry-out side.

When people set up orders either online or big catering orders through the management and that’s what is a BEO.

A banquet event order for catering.

When I set up those orders, it's available to me through the POS System to close out, and with closing those out I am able to collect the check in my name considering that is the work I have done and that is the order I have fulfilled.

I do these orders and sometimes there is a driver hired by the restaurant through door dash when it comes to delivery for those. Since the check is closed through me, with my years of working here I have been informed that only I keep those tips, and if there is someone else working with me we share them as we both did the work. Along with also sharing some of the pool with the kitchen. (This will apply to my story later)

The only way we would share tips for a delivery is if our store had a driver, where then we would share tips with the driver (we used to have one before the management that is here currently)

I believe this manager is stealing tips is through this way.

Instead of the order being available on my system as I mentioned earlier so that I could close out, I am assuming he transfers it to his own account or another account where he can close out, and safely remove the cash from the register or safe for himself with no repercussions.

He instead will show me the ticket that comes out of the cook's printer and tells me that is the order, not providing anything but the name and the items listed.

For the first time I’ve experienced this, we had received an order from another restaurant which unfortunately was flooded, and so the BEO was transferred to the location I work at where customers had to pick up their catering order through us.

When seeing this BEO there was a tip on it. Me and a co-worker would be able to split it once completing the order but we were wondering how to be able to submit it into the system since it was not showing in the system, meaning someone else closed it out, or it made sense that since it was a transferred order it did not appear set in our system for that day, meaning the order had to be just told to the cooks.

I was working alone in the morning and was the first to ask this to the manager.

When asking the manager about how I would put in the tips, I was told “This doesn’t apply to you since it is an order from the other store”

This made me wonder, then who does the money go to, it would make sense if the other store collects the payment, but the tip is not theirs as me and my co-worker were doing the work.

I was told to not be greedy as another order had tipped me already.

Greedy because I’m entitled to the tips I receive?

I told him if it was even a quarter I appreciate anything people are willing to tip.

He laughed at me and said “You want a quarter? Here you go.” And laid it on the table for me laughing.

Once my other co-worker arrived I let her know about the situation. Showed her the order details showing the payment. She agreed that it didn’t seem right that the money wouldn’t go to us.

When telling her though and checking with another manager, the main manager that told me about the order in the morning ran to us and gave the same explanation. He's always monitoring everyone (understandable as a manager) and has even told me he watches everyone to make sure they don't talk about him, almost in a threatening way although I don't care enough to talk behind peoples backs as I would rather do it up front if I had an issue. But I see it as he doesn't want anyone else to slip up for what he does.

I told that co-worker later, that when he leaves to let another manager that I’ll name Manager2 about the order.

Manager2 was from a different location coming into help as we have been understaffed.

I was later informed by that carry-out co worker that the order was in fact in our system, and she was able to take out that money, leaving my half in the safe.

That was the first time I experienced that and I have been growing suspicious.

For the most recent time, this has just happened Saturday June the 15th I believe.

I walked into work, informed by my other co-worker the day before that there is an order that includes a big tip for me to do in the morning.

Immediately, I know that it’ll be hidden from me as on Saturday mornings that manager opens the store.

I walk in, and wait to clock in at my time. I walk over to him and ask him, what order are we working on? He proceeds to say, “What order?” In a mocking tone.

I tell him, the order the chef is working on right now.

He runs and grabs the firing ticket that shows me the food items, (not the order sheet where I can see everything in full detail)I tell him I want to see the firing sheet. He acts like he lost it and is figuring out where it went, and then runs to his office. I’m told by the chef that she just had it in front of her (possibly removed it as he saw me there a couple of minutes before my shift), implying this manager had just removed it hoping I wouldn’t ask about the details and just follow through. He hands it to me and I look at it and there is a big tip on it. I walk over to the computer pos system and check to make sure the order is there in order to be able to close out/review with the door dash driver that has been scheduled. The moment I enter the carry-out room the manager says out loud that it’s already closed out. I ask him, why would the order I’m working on be closed out if I didn’t do so yet. He explains that it is already in the system like that. I walk over to him and ask him how would I cash out on the tip that was presented. “That is not yours”

I tell him, how would it not be mine if I am the one in charge of the order in my shift.

He tells me it goes to the driver (Keep this in mind)

I tell him there’s something shady about this, first the order being hidden from me from the moment I got there and then being closed out under someone or something else.

He starts to yell “Are you questioning my integrity?” And I tell him “Your actions are making me question your integrity”

Soon he begins to get flustered and red saying “I’m going to call the district manager and have her explain it to you”

He takes me to his office and calls what I assume is the district manager.

He tells her, “Could you PLEASE tell \_\_\_\_\_\_ about the policy?”

She proceeds to tell me that the money goes to the driver, (of course but what she means is that it doesn't to the delivery driver if they're scheduled with door dash) but says it in the way that it goes into the restaurant in order to pay FOR the delivery drivers that get hired through door dash for the orders. She tells me that if I want to earn that money I should become a driver for the restaurant and apply for that.

I ask about why do people pay for delivery then and for that large sum of tip money why would that go back to the restaurant and not the actual employees working for that.

Things just seem suspicious from here, and shortly the call ends by saying I’m a great worker and thanks me for my job.

The manager grins at me, and says “We aren’t supposed to give you guys the tips for delivery drivers, it used to be like that before but we have just changed the policy.”

It’s interesting that the policy suddenly changes the moment there is a huge order with a huge tip (Past $150 dollars)

He proceeds to tell me that he was going to be nice enough and give me $40 dollars of that tip, because he is a nice guy, although like he said “He is not supposed to be giving me that money”

Because I questioned his integrity as he kept repeating, he will no longer give me a dime is what he says.

We walk out of the office and I go back to setting up the order for the delivery.

Later on in the day, he offers me the $40 again, I’m assuming because he wants me to keep my mouth shut about this issue and knows I know there’s a problem.

I decline, and continue with my day.

&amp;#x200B;

To add to his character, there is one more story.

Another issue that I would see as more of a loophole but not stealing would be with this story I have heard with another order, that had a tip of an estimated $340 dollars. (I was not here for this tip, but as I manage orders I was able to see it)

This was a huge order that would need an employee to work for, but conveniently that said employee was scheduled a different shift time than the usual. Anyone could see that this was because that manager did not want her to share in any part of the tip and wanted to do the work so that he would cash out for that otherwise I’m wondering where that money went.

When I asked this employee, she said she came in early of course to help out, but was being told they need no help as the manager would handle it entirely and would not allow her to clock in. No other carry-out was there for this order, an order of over $1500 dollars.

We usually start earlier but it’s interesting that he would schedule her later for once. I would not say this is stealing but more of taking advantage of being a manager in order to set things up for himself.

I’m not sure if a manager does an order if they are able to keep the money or what they do with it, but that’s just another story as I said.

I want to know what action I can take, how to take it, or if I’m in the wrong with this and there is nothing suspicious. I'll go ahead and provide any more details if needed. Thanks in advance to anyone! This store manager does not have the best reputation here, and even servers get upset as I've heard he has taken huge tables by himself in order to cash in the tips for himself. (makes sense you get the tips but you're a store manager and you have employees)

The only other person that I've mentioned all this too is the head chef, and she has mentioned filing with the labor union, she also agrees that he provides a negative environment. Still, I don't get why she hasn't spoken out on it, but I'll respect her and try to be the one to speak up for not just myself but for other employee's.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi legal advice reddit, I have a question regarding how tips in restaurants are handled.

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the order being available on my system as I mentioned earlier so that I could close out, I am assuming he transfers it to his own account or another account where he can close out, and safely remove the cash from the register or safe for himself with no repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He instead will show me the ticket that comes out of the cook&amp;#39;s printer and tells me that is the order, not providing anything but the name and the items listed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time I’ve experienced this, we had received an order from another restaurant which unfortunately was flooded, and so the BEO was transferred to the location I work at where customers had to pick up their catering order through us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When seeing this BEO there was a tip on it. Me and a co-worker would be able to split it once completing the order but we were wondering how to be able to submit it into the system since it was not showing in the system, meaning someone else closed it out, or it made sense that since it was a transferred order it did not appear set in our system for that day, meaning the order had to be just told to the cooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was working alone in the morning and was the first to ask this to the manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asking the manager about how I would put in the tips, I was told “This doesn’t apply to you since it is an order from the other store”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me wonder, then who does the money go to, it would make sense if the other store collects the payment, but the tip is not theirs as me and my co-worker were doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told to not be greedy as another order had tipped me already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greedy because I’m entitled to the tips I receive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told him if it was even a quarter I appreciate anything people are willing to tip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He laughed at me and said “You want a quarter? Here you go.” And laid it on the table for me laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once my other co-worker arrived I let her know about the situation. Showed her the order details showing the payment. She agreed that it didn’t seem right that the money wouldn’t go to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When telling her though and checking with another manager, the main manager that told me about the order in the morning ran to us and gave the same explanation. He&amp;#39;s always monitoring everyone (understandable as a manager) and has even told me he watches everyone to make sure they don&amp;#39;t talk about him, almost in a threatening way although I don&amp;#39;t care enough to talk behind peoples backs as I would rather do it up front if I had an issue. But I see it as he doesn&amp;#39;t want anyone else to slip up for what he does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told that co-worker later, that when he leaves to let another manager that I’ll name Manager2 about the order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manager2 was from a different location coming into help as we have been understaffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was later informed by that carry-out co worker that the order was in fact in our system, and she was able to take out that money, leaving my half in the safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the first time I experienced that and I have been growing suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most recent time, this has just happened Saturday June the 15th I believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked into work, informed by my other co-worker the day before that there is an order that includes a big tip for me to do in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I know that it’ll be hidden from me as on Saturday mornings that manager opens the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walk in, and wait to clock in at my time. I walk over to him and ask him, what order are we working on? He proceeds to say, “What order?” In a mocking tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tell him, the order the chef is working on right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He runs and grabs the firing ticket that shows me the food items, (not the order sheet where I can see everything in full detail)I tell him I want to see the firing sheet. He acts like he lost it and is figuring out where it went, and then runs to his office. I’m told by the chef that she just had it in front of her (possibly removed it as he saw me there a couple of minutes before my shift), implying this manager had just removed it hoping I wouldn’t ask about the details and just follow through. He hands it to me and I look at it and there is a big tip on it. I walk over to the computer pos system and check to make sure the order is there in order to be able to close out/review with the door dash driver that has been scheduled. The moment I enter the carry-out room the manager says out loud that it’s already closed out. I ask him, why would the order I’m working on be closed out if I didn’t do so yet. He explains that it is already in the system like that. I walk over to him and ask him how would I cash out on the tip that was presented. “That is not yours”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tell him, how would it not be mine if I am the one in charge of the order in my shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tells me it goes to the driver (Keep this in mind)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tell him there’s something shady about this, first the order being hidden from me from the moment I got there and then being closed out under someone or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He starts to yell “Are you questioning my integrity?” And I tell him “Your actions are making me question your integrity”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon he begins to get flustered and red saying “I’m going to call the district manager and have her explain it to you”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He takes me to his office and calls what I assume is the district manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He tells her, “Could you PLEASE tell ______ about the policy?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She proceeds to tell me that the money goes to the driver, (of course but what she means is that it doesn&amp;#39;t to the delivery driver if they&amp;#39;re scheduled with door dash) but says it in the way that it goes into the restaurant in order to pay FOR the delivery drivers that get hired through door dash for the orders. She tells me that if I want to earn that money I should become a driver for the restaurant and apply for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask about why do people pay for delivery then and for that large sum of tip money why would that go back to the restaurant and not the actual employees working for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things just seem suspicious from here, and shortly the call ends by saying I’m a great worker and thanks me for my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The manager grins at me, and says “We aren’t supposed to give you guys the tips for delivery drivers, it used to be like that before but we have just changed the policy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting that the policy suddenly changes the moment there is a huge order with a huge tip (Past $150 dollars)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He proceeds to tell me that he was going to be nice enough and give me $40 dollars of that tip, because he is a nice guy, although like he said “He is not supposed to be giving me that money”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I questioned his integrity as he kept repeating, he will no longer give me a dime is what he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walk out of the office and I go back to setting up the order for the delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on in the day, he offers me the $40 again, I’m assuming because he wants me to keep my mouth shut about this issue and knows I know there’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decline, and continue with my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add to his character, there is one more story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue that I would see as more of a loophole but not stealing would be with this story I have heard with another order, that had a tip of an estimated $340 dollars. (I was not here for this tip, but as I manage orders I was able to see it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a huge order that would need an employee to work for, but conveniently that said employee was scheduled a different shift time than the usual. Anyone could see that this was because that manager did not want her to share in any part of the tip and wanted to do the work so that he would cash out for that otherwise I’m wondering where that money went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked this employee, she said she came in early of course to help out, but was being told they need no help as the manager would handle it entirely and would not allow her to clock in. No other carry-out was there for this order, an order of over $1500 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We usually start earlier but it’s interesting that he would schedule her later for once. I would not say this is stealing but more of taking advantage of being a manager in order to set things up for himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if a manager does an order if they are able to keep the money or what they do with it, but that’s just another story as I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know what action I can take, how to take it, or if I’m in the wrong with this and there is nothing suspicious. I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and provide any more details if needed. Thanks in advance to anyone! This store manager does not have the best reputation here, and even servers get upset as I&amp;#39;ve heard he has taken huge tables by himself in order to cash in the tips for himself. (makes sense you get the tips but you&amp;#39;re a store manager and you have employees)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other person that I&amp;#39;ve mentioned all this too is the head chef, and she has mentioned filing with the labor union, she also agrees that he provides a negative environment. Still, I don&amp;#39;t get why she hasn&amp;#39;t spoken out on it, but I&amp;#39;ll respect her and try to be the one to speak up for not just myself but for other employee&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I was notified of a hearing for non-payment of rent. I have paid all of the outstanding rent and the landlord told me that I don't need to go to the hearing since I paid. They said they will forward me a confirmation that they are withdrawing, but I have not received anything official except e-mails confirming that there is no longer an issue and that they are withdrawing. The hearing is on Monday. I am concerned about miscommunications and default judgements. Should I take off work and go to the hearing? If I do not go and there is a judgement, is there still any way to stop the eviction after the fact?

There's no way this is legal.  What do I do?

Hello!  I've not been on Reddit long, nor really understand it, but created an account to ask about this.

For disclosure, I'm training as a UK and European patent attorney, so a lot US patent law (and law in general) is pretty opaque to me.

I've got a case where we've filed a Patent Term Extension (PTE) Request.  A few months later, the USPTO sent a letter to the FDA, which explicitly states that it is ""NOT to be considered as notice which may be made in the future pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 156(d)(2)(A)"".

This paragraph states the following:

""(A)Within 60 days of the submittal of an application for extension of the term of a patent under paragraph (1), the Director shall notify—

(i)

the Secretary of Agriculture if the patentclaims a drug product or a method of using or manufacturing a drug product and the drug product is subject to the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act, and

(ii)

the Secretary of Health and Human Services if the patentclaims any other drug product, a medical device, or a food additive or color additive or a method of using or manufacturing such aproduct, device, or additive and if theproduct, device, and additive are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,

of the extension application and shall submit to the Secretary who is so notified a copy of the application. Not later than 30 days after the receipt of an application from the Director, the Secretary receiving the application shall review the dates contained in the application pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) and determine the applicable regulatory review period, shall notify the Director of the determination, and shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of such determination.""

Nothing has been done by the USPTO or the FDA within the time frames set out by this section.

&amp;#x200B;

First off - Renters 8 months into a 1 year lease at a duplex in OH, USA.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my S/O are facing a situation where bed bugs were introduced into the home by the tenant that lives below us. This was confirmed by the property manager. They started entering our home 3 weeks ago at this point, and as soon as we seen the first one we notified the property manager. They purchased us some over the counter sprays, and then tried an at home heat treatment using large propane (maybe kerosene?) heaters, about 5 days after calling about the bed bug spotting. During this time we had to move majority of our items outside of our home, and package anything upholstered or cloth like in bags and bins. I had to take time off work because they wanted to do it during the day. The heat treatment did not work, and the over the counter sprays were not working either. They finally called an exterminator to get the situation dealt with professionally (1.5 weeks after initial spotting) The exterminator was scheduled to come out to my unit at 3:30 PM, so again I had to take off work (just left a little early that day). The exterminator arrived at the downstairs unit and did his business and then got in his truck and left. Contacted the property manager and let her know that they missed our appointment. However, we had already prepared for him and removed our animals from the location. Another appointment was set up for the following day, at 3:30. Again I left work early to make this appointment. They never showed up. Contacted the property manager again to let her know the situation. Then another appointment was set up the day after, again at 3:30. They called at 5:00PM to let the property manager know that they weren't able to come. She called and complained until they finally got someone to come out to our house at 6:30 and spray. The landlord only paid for 2 of our rooms to be sprayed despite us stating that we had found them in multiple rooms of the house. The exterminator did his business and now its 7 days later and we are still finding bed bugs. We have put a couple that we have found in a plastic bag. We have been living out of garbage bags and bins that we purchased that are air-tight. We have continued to use our over the counter spray, and it does not seem to be working as I am still getting bit. We will have to throw away our brand new furniture and dining room chairs, as that is where we are getting bit at the most it seems. We are unable to take the cushions off the couches, and treat them properly.

&amp;#x200B;

With the information above, I had done a little bit of research on my own and found that there is a law within the state of Ohio that makes the property owner have to provide us with livable conditions within the home, I searched if bed bugs counted as unlivable conditions and wasn't able to find a clear answer. Do we have the right to withhold rental payment until the situation is resolved? 

&amp;#x200B;

Please note not sure if this is important to the story - however, we are closing on a house at the end of the month, and we  had made a verbal non contractual agreement with the property manager, that so long as we provide a written 30 day notice, and they are able to rent the unit out, they said they will not make us pay rent for the remainder of the lease.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if you need any additional information, we are feeling trapped at this point, and have had many difficulties sleeping because of the constant fear of bugs and getting bit.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning all,&lt;/p&gt;

Dated someone for a short amount of time. Clearly told them I no longer wanted to see them. They kept showing up to and driving past my house. I told a mutual friend who told him to stop coming to my house. He kept coming and I've had to call the police several times, at this point I have a restraining order against him. His main ""thing"" when trying to constantly find me or contact me is to convince me that I'm wrong about him and that he doesn't want me back , just for me to acknowledge he wasn't stalking me, he's obsessed with proving this. Which is crazy because if he had just stopped showing up weeks ago no one would have ever even known, we don't work together, i don't know his family, it would have just gone away.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I got served with papers in small claim court. I'm being sued for defamation of character. Specifically when I told that friend that he had been stalking me. He's suing me for legal fees related to the restraining order as well as therapy he's had to get for what these claims have done to him.  He's claiming we were still in a relationship at the time and that he had no idea he didn't want me to come over. The whole thing is bananas but I still have to go to court. I honestly feel like this is just another way to finally see me in person though which sucks. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do here? I assume there's no way not to go to court and see him. I obviously have the restraining order as well as footage from cameras I had to place around my property showing him showing up multiple times after I officially told him in written form to stop coming to my property. Can I bring all this to small claims? I have a lawyer (which is costing me a ton already) so I'm in decent hands but I rather use him as little as possible and I guess I can't go into small claims with him anyways, plus I won't get to talk to him till after the 4th and this is stressing me out so here I am.

First time poster here. This is an ongoing situation so I’m sorry for lack of details

I work in a store in a pretty popular mall in. It’s been extremely humid in the state of Maryland for the past few days and as such, outdoor stairs are pretty slippery in the morning.

I parked in my usual spot in the garage closest to my store. The stairs I fell down are known for being pretty treacherous when wet and there’s almost never any wet floor signs except for the few times a month they power wash them. 

I was walking down the last flight and fell pretty hard causing a pretty severe bruise (possible break, X-rays aren’t back yet) to my forearm and minor injury to my lower back. I’ve filed an incident report with the security office, but I’d love some advice from anyone who has filed a suit about personal injury against a large company like a mall? I’m not familiar with any legal implications and would love any guidance on what my options are from here.

I've always understood MAP to be a ""take it or leave it"" policy. In other words, I've always understood MAP to be a policy where if you don't follow it, you can be terminated as a dealer. I didn't think dealers could be sued (successfully) for not following it.

Also, I understood MAP to only be in effect while the dealership was active. I didn't think they could hold you to MAP after being terminated (when it didn't specifically give guidance with regards to MAP after a dealership was terminated).

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: We did show them countless violations by other dealers before and after being sued. They didn't care about the others. They rarely enforced MAP, unless it was really bad. In fact, they truly didn't terminate us for a MAP violation, it was for selling a competitor's product. They just cited MAP as an excuse for termination after being challenged. And actually, the product they cited was one that they ""unofficially"" told us was OK to advertise below MAP a few months earlier.

After termination, they gave us 56 days to sell thru existing inventory and refused to take anything back for a refund. They demanded any unsold product after 56 days to never be advertised or even sold...ever. That was when we dropped pricing on everything to get rid of the gear ASAP.

My partner communicated to me, when I started to do research about my rights. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the tax assessors office and the home doesn't even have the basement listed as finished, let alone as an in law. 

It is a raised ranch with an in-law apartment in the basement. It is a one bedroom apartment with only one door to exit the apartment. You have to go through three doors just to get outside. 

The contract says that they will not pay interest, but I am pretty sure it is the law.

I didn't receive a receipt from what bank my last month's rent was deposited.

I did not receive a statement of condition.

Timeline

February 1: Move in date. A few days before we signed the lease and gave first, last and security deposit. 

May 14: We talk to the landlord about leaving by June 1st if not July 1st. She said she would have to get back to us about      -------------June 1st but made it seem like July 1st was an okay date to move out by.

June 2: Phone call from landlord stating we were living there for free and she was going to call cops and her lawyer. Tried being civil and saying okay well can we pay you for  1/2 days in July to smooth this over. She said that they have financial obligations they have to take care of and we can't just not give proper notice.

June 3: I do research and go to the tax assessors office where there is no record of this apartment. Tax assessors say they will be paying her a visit once I vacate. I communicate with them and she says to me, "" Your partner didn't say that you would be leaving, ""he"" said he was moving out because he can't stand to be with you anymore."" ....we just bought a house... At this point I explain the situation about the contract being written against my rights as a tenant as well are her apartment not being legitimant  as far as the town was concerned. She said so you'll be out by the First of July and I said yes and that I expect my security deposit and interest upon leaving.

June 30: Up until this point they have been ignoring us at all costs. We clean the entire place (cleaner than when we moved in)  and once everything is moved and clean we leave and put the keys under their front matt. 

I wanted to give them the weekend to enjoy their holiday (and enjoy mine without thinking about it) and then call them Monday telling them the address to send the check.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be prepared for the phone call so I can face any personal attacks with a sense of confidence because I will have some knowledge. Please let me know what to do?

Long story short I quit the start up. I've been asked to sign a Confidentiality and Assignment agreement with a non-compete AFTER the fact. I refused to signed a non-compete, and had that removed.

I'm reluctant because I think its too broad, and the people running the company are jerks so I'm really just being a pain. 

Maybe language like this is just boiler plate :

""I will make full and prompt  disclosure to the Company of all inventions,""  

if I've already signed a C&amp;A with my real (pays me) employer  does that trump this one? Does this expect me to disclose what I'm doing in my day job (I know that's absurd, but legally speaking) ?

One verbal agreement we had is that she would pay half of the utilities.  Though after a recent and more expensive shopping trip I had verbally agreed to wave this for a month.  However, she has now entered the premises and taken everything from that purchase.

I have now asked her to pay the remainder of the utilities, though any contact is met with ""You are harassing me, stop contacting me""

She has also knowingly caused a considerable amount of damage to the driveway by parking a vehicle there and leaking a ton of oil which I had previously asked her to take care of and she hasn't.  This is also a 6-month-old house she has done this damage to.

I just bought a house with what I thought was a very nice backyard, but after looking into installing a fence (for my dog) it seems that the legal property line is wildly different from the areas that were maintained by the previous homeowner based on natural boundaries. Obviously the town wont likely approve a fence outside my property line, I'm just curious about what my options are depending on how zealous I am about pursuing this. Here are some pertinent details:

1. The area that I thought was my property based on natural boundaries and past owner maintenance is actually part of an adjacent cemetery.
2. The area in question is not at all near any graves, furthermore there is an impassible barrier of trees and ivy between this area and the grave sites (see image: [https://imgur.com/GS7Wgu6](https://imgur.com/GS7Wgu6)).
3. Finding a way to extend a fence through this area would be highly beneficial because it increases the usable backyard area by 25%-ish.
4. Location: Monroe County, NY, USA

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that out of the way, I have some questions:

1. Is there any scenario where I can legally build a fence on this area without purchasing that piece of property? Like with some legal agreement between me and the cemetery owner (perhaps involving compensation)?
2. If the above won't work, what are possible steps towards collaborating with the cemetery owner to perhaps subdivide and purchase the area in question? Surveyor, attorney, government fees, etc. The area would otherwise be wasted space if it is excluded by a fence, and I am prepared to offer fair compensation.
3. How do I go about finding the owner of the cemetery? I have the cemetery parcel's New York ""Tax ID"", but the online deed records don't go back far enough to have any documents, and the tax records don't have a name (perhaps because cemeteries are tax free?). The most recent gravestone has a 1910 death date, and it appears to be a family cemetery (someone cuts the grass, don't know who).

I got pulled over tonight in the car I bought from a dealership late last year for expired registration.  I have every paper in my glove box from my past 3 vehicles and their insurance, etc (no joke, it's stupid and I need to declutter that and be less paranoid about needing ancient paperwork), but do you think I could find my registration tonight?  Of course not, and that's on me.  But at the time of purchase (less than a year ago) the dealership took care of (or so I thought) the registration along with the title stuff.  I never received a renewal notice in the mail like I usually do, and by my calculations I shouldn't have expected to for a few months.  Registration has always been yearly.

So I check the paperwork from when I bought the car and they lumped the title and registration fees into one cost.  By checking my states DMV and related websites, I found that what they charged adds up to a year of registration plus the title fees.  I'm going to try to straighten this out tomorrow (today?  It was late driving home.), but I was wondering if anyone out there had any insight about why a vehicle would be registered for less than a year by the dealership anyway, especially if they're going to (seemingly?) charge for a whole year.  The way I see it, either I made an error somewhere, the dealership made an error, or the dealership is overcharging in their fees knowingly and are at least somewhat misleading about it, at least from where I'm standing now.  I fully own that I could have screwed something up, but if that's the case it's just not obvious to me at the moment.  I've never heard of registrations being for anything less than a year, so that's why I didn't ask about that at the time of purchase.

I checked my status with the DMV online and it says the same thing the officer told me.  I'm not young, I've never missed a renewal, inspection, etc ever.  I've never gotten so much as a speeding or parking ticket and I've been driving for decades, so you can maybe understand my stress and confusion here.

 Also, I only have 10 days to figure it out and plead guilty or not guilty, and three of them are the weekend after the 4th of the July so.....yeah.

So happy news! I called again today taking a chance they might be open. Turns out they were. A wonderful women dug into to my account. Turns out EVERYTHING I been told before was a flat out lie. This infuriates me but I'm also happy that it will be an easy resolution. It seems like they hired some new employees. I took sometime on the phone going over my notes from previous calls explaining to her what I was told. (She can also see notes on her side from my previous calls). I didnt want to take up too much of her time asking why I was told these things and I doubt she would have an answer anyways. 

As for the credit, once the arrears clears I can file a dispute with my credit agency and it should be taken off. The woman that I spoke knows the person who processes credit disputes in the office. She is going to give her a heads up so she knows what is going on. 

Lastly, I did get the name of the woman I spoke to in case there is any other problems. 


For those interested here are the lies and correct information. 


Lie #1: My arrears was way higher than what it actually is. 

Resolution: In Feburary I was told I had to pay over $1000 to get out of arrears. I knew this total was impossible and they could not adequately explain it. Only an additional $30 is taken out each month for arrears. My total arrears I'm paying today is $350. 

Lie #2: My payment will always be late due to when my employer paid.

Resolution: My payment from the 1st is counting for the current month. They usually receive it around the 5th. It's not late until the end of the month. I think previously they were telling me that my payment for the 1st was for the previous month. Its July and they already received my July payment. I do not owe June, it was already paid. Just my arrears from when the account was initially set up. 

Lie #3: You can't carry a credit on your account

Resolution: You absolutely can. However, since my pay is steady through the Army this won't be an issue and it was recommend against putting a credit on because of that.

I began paying child support for my son in November. Because of the time it takes to get started I was delinquent on a month and a half. When I called to fix it, I was in arrears and they told me to let the arrears take care of the deliquency.  I'm in the military and live out of state from the agency which is in Ohio. I wanted to get it fixed so I called again and wanted to pay my deliquency plus 1 month ahead because depending on DFAS (military pay) it could be late again putting me into arrears again. They told me that I could pay but the account will not carry a credit. So if I pay extra, it's just extra and doesn't count to the next month. They also told me that it would be impossible for me to get out of arrears now because of how DFAS pays in connection with dates the state wants the payment. DFAS which also pays civilian government employees (millions of people) won't and can't do anything to help. State law states I HAVE to pay through my employer, I can't just make the payment on my own. Today I discovered my credit score is quickly dropping because of this.

I called my attorney on the divorce and child custody and they don't handle it. They told me other lawyers will not get involved because there is nothing they can do. Also I pay state tax I should receive back due to being in the military that I won't receive due to arrears that I will never be able to clear.  I need help. If you have any experience I would greatly appreciate it. I'm not trying to get out of paying child support. I'm trying to fix it but the agency is making it impossible. I've called several times talking for several hours and gotten no where. 

(Though it shouldn't matter, for reference I am a female that left an abusive marriage. My ex had a better lawyer and I moved out of the state so the proceedings favored my ex. There is a lot more to this but I don't feel like its revelant. We share full parental custody but I have less parenting time hence the child support).

I recently moved into a house very close to campus of pur local university. We have a small driveway in the front that can fit one car and a gravel lot behind our back yard that can fit 3-4 more cars accessed via an alley. Since I've moved here, there have been several occasions of cars parking in our lot. The lease states this is our parking space and part of the property owned by the landlord. The cars usually park like assholes or take up the last spots making it difficult for the ones who live here to park. 

I've left notes on the vehicles to no avail, often seeing the same car show back up. Towing would be an obvious option, but my roommate is feeling extra vindictive.

My question: would it be legal in Colorado to boot these cars with our own personal car boot seeing as it is illegally parked on our property?

I feel very stuck. I've asked them to get a new housemate to replace me, they said no. I asked them to break the tenancy altogether (something the landlord has offered to us already) and they said no. 

I can't just leave as I'd still be liable for my 1/3 of the rent.

This morning, I went to meet a client that that I’ve been talking to for a few days. The son was 8 years old. He was very quiet and was messily eating his breakfast. He didn’t speak a word to me and I thought he was very shy. 

The mom just told me that I would have to look after the house and feed him. And she told me the hours I had to work and I gave an hourly rate. She was doing a tour of everything and showed me his room. When I was in there I noticed a box of diapers in the corner, one diaper on the dresser and a box of wipes. I got a little concerned and asked her about it. I thought she would just say the diaper is only because of nightly bed wetting. Turns out her son has autism, he is not really verbal and not potty trained. I told her that I charge more when I have to give that much care. She got angry and said she was going to report me to the website. And that it’s illegal and discriminatory to charge her more for her sons disability. 

My usual rate is cheaper than most. I only do older children that I basically just have to be in the room with. I do homework and study for classes for majority of the time. I’ve only had like 4-5 special needs clients and they required more care so I charge more. The other parents were upfront about the child’s needs and what my duties were (diapers, hitting, spitting, bitting, cleanups, constant monitoring)  She never mentioned her son being special needs since we’ve been talking that’s why I told her the cheaper price.

She also threatened to report me to the board of nursing, even though I didn’t get hired as a CNA. I recently got my CNA, the only reason she even knows about it is because this morning as we were chatting over coffee, she had asked me about my life/college/nursing major. I just mentioned it.

Is what I did illegal? Can I be reported for something that doesn’t have anything to do with my CNA?

The other parents were upfront about the child’s needs and what my duties were (diapers, hitting, spitting, bitting, cleanups, constant monitoring)  She never mentioned her son being special needs since we’ve been talking that’s why I told her the cheaper price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also threatened to report me to the board of nursing, even though I didn’t get hired as a CNA. I recently got my CNA, the only reason she even knows about it is because this morning as we were chatting over coffee, she had asked me about my life/college/nursing major. I just mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is what I did illegal? Can I be reported for something that doesn’t have anything to do with my CNA? She is furious and I don’t doubt she’ll make as big of a fuss as she can, what can I do?&lt;/p&gt;

We are suing our partner for just over 2 million. The case is over 7 years old and the law suit started nearly 3 years ago. The store was sold and, although the property is owned on the deed by both partners, only the defendant has been receiving rent - denying us our share. There are many more terrible offenses, including stealing, fraud, and witness harassment that are more important to the case but not important to explaining why I've lost trust in my lawyer.



Here are some of the reasons:



He is CONSTANTLY procrastinating until the very last day (and even the morning of) until I literally have to push him and/or do the work for him to get a motion on the table or to make progress in the case. I literally woke up 4:00 AM the morning of the trial to have out exhibit list in binders in the proper order because he was ""too sleepy"" at 6:00 PM the night before and never got it done beforehand. I was literally still scrambling to get the list in order in four binders while in the benches before the trail was supposed to start, having been delayed because he forgot the bylaws in the office and had to go get them.



Since day one our attorney promised to have the rent that was being paid to the defendant frozen into an escrow account until the case is over - it has been 3 years with little to no effort in passing this obvious motion with both partners being on the property deed.



He literally waited until the last week to ask for a deposition of the defendant - THEN waited until the night before said deposition to start calling court reporters (all of which were busy). The deposition failed because of this.



During the failed deposition he went to a separate room with the defendant's attorney and agreed to do ""a voluntary"" if the defendant's attorney agreed to ""accept service"" should a motion to continue be denied.



The motion to continue was denied by the judge - but the judge expressed that he was very upset because NONE of the attorneys wrote him a litigation brief. And none of them were ""conducting litigation in the way it is supposed to be conducted.""



I denied the voluntary because I had enough of this case, but in a back room with the judge and attorney they somehow agreed to a continuance.



The continuance is for four more months and my attorney has not made the motions he agreed he would make the next day which included freezing the rent in escrow, having the defendant pay the outstanding real estate taxes from the rent before the business is lost in delinquent taxes, and issuing a subpoena to the bank for essential records.


It is impossible to get a hold of the attorney because he NEVER answers his phone and doesn't want to talk until he wants to start asking for money.



I'm out of my mind doing our attorney's job for him alongside my day job and still getting nowhere.



I'd like to ask you all here, am I a paranoid asshole? How much of this is reasonable and, if so, how badly do I need a new attorney? Can I change my attorney now? What process do I need to go through? Aside from word of mouth or taking a gamble on the bar are there ways to find honest attorneys? I fully understand that he may be an exception rather than the norm, but he is the only lawyer I've really dealt with and it is a painful experience.

&gt; Q. I am a single owner of a U.S. LLC, non-U.S. person living abroad. My company provides remote services. Do I need to file tax return and pay income tax?

&gt; A single member LLC that elected to be a disregarded entity (a default election) would only pay tax based on the tax status of the owner. Since the owner is not physically present in the US and is providing services remotely there would be no income effectively connected to the US. That means the LLC would owe no US tax, except for the annual registration fee in the state of LLC registration, and there would be no US federal tax obligation (in other words there is no requirement to file income tax either).

&gt; Keep in mind though - you might not technically be producing income in the U.S., but you still could be (and chances are) liable to income tax on this income in your country.

1) If you are a single owner of a US LLC as a non-US person living outside of US, you owe no US tax. Is there a limit to that? What if your business goes viral and you make millions? Still no US taxes?

&gt; Previously single member LLCs with foreign owners were not required to file. However, starting 2017, all foreigners who own a US LLC must file a 5472 US tax return with the IRS for disclosure purposes even if they do not owe tax in the US. 

&gt; This requirement should be taken seriously. If Form 5472 is not filed or filed incorrectly, the IRS charges a minimum penalty of $25,000 USD (increased from $10,000).

&gt; Starting in 2017, all foreign-owned Single-Member LLCs that are Disregarded Entities are now treated as Corporations for federal reporting requirements (submitting information) to the IRS. This doesn’t mean the LLC is paying tax like a Corporation, but rather, it’s simply reporting information like a Corporation. Source: llcuniversity . com /irs/form-5472-foreign-owned-llc


2) Is there any hidden catch about 5472? Merely hiring a CPA who knows how to fill it out is enough?

PS. I'm a nonresident alien for tax purposes. Which means I owe no tax on the income of LLC, as far as I know. But **I feel like there must be a catch if the business goes viral and I make millions and pay no US taxes.** I'm thinking too far ahead but better to be safe than sorry, especially as someone who owns a company in another country and dealing with IRS. 

PS. Information below puts me into no US tax category. 

&gt; You’re subject to US tax on business income only if you are “engaged in a trade or business in the United States,” or “ETBUS” for short.
&gt; You’re ETBUS only if two things are true: (1) you have at least one “dependent agent” in the US, and (ii) that dependent agent does something substantial to further your business in the US (as opposed to something purely administrative or ministerial).
&gt; Finally, if you can benefit from an applicable tax treaty, then you’re only subject to tax if (in addition to being ETBUS) you operate in the US through a “permanent establishment” (e.g., an office or other fixed place of business).
&gt; Let’s look at the different moving parts above in more detail.
&gt; 
&gt; WHAT’S A DEPENDENT AGENT?
&gt; A dependent agent is basically a person who works for you so closely that the dependent agent’s actions can be said to be an extension of your own actions. So, the term definitely includes your employees. But it also includes people in two other categories:
&gt; 
&gt; Individuals who work for you as an independent contractor, but who do so much work for you that they’re basically indistinguishable from an employee, and
&gt; Companies who provide services exclusively (or almost exclusively) to you. Source: ustax.bz/non-us-entrepreneurs/

The neighbors have a party every year where they get drunk and light fireworks on the median strip. These are not the ones that go “pop”, they go “boom” and set off car alarms, rattle my windows, and punch me in the chest if I stand near the front of my house. This goes on for 2-3 hours. 

I can’t sleep and work early in the morning. My roomate suffers from post traumatic stress and the percussive force of the big fireworks causes a panic attack.

This year, in addition to leaving fireworks boxes smoldering in the street, they have escalated to leaving pallets on my property.

I live in IL and have been separated from my husband for almost two years now. We have a 3 year old. My ex has a girlfriend that he lives next door to, and she watches my kid while hes with his dad. There is no custody agreement on paper, but typically we exchange every other week. 

I have just hired a lawyer and he is out of town for the holiday so I can't contact him, and all of this just happened two days ago. 

Basically, this girlfriend is bad news. She has a history of domestic violence and just got off probation for her last offense maybe 5 months ago. My ex has told me that she hits him constantly, and has even pulled a knife on him before. She is always trying to pick fights and is extremely argumentative. She is also pregnant now with my ex's child (allegedly.) My ex says none of this ever happens around our kid, but I do know she has lost custody of her own child in the past and recently got the child back. 

Two days ago while my son was over there she and my ex got into a fight. She beat my ex up in front of my kid. My ex was covered in blood and the cops were called. my ex told me that she ripped a tablet out of my son's hands and then started beating the hell out of my ex. He told me she was getting arrested. He dropped my kid off at my mom's house and I picked him up. He had no shoes, so I went back to my ex's to get his shoes. Well the gf was there and inside his apartment. I told my ex he was an idiot and we started arguing, and she came out and started yelling at me. Long story short, my ex said it would never happen again and that he trusted her to be around our child and that they were getting back together. He took my son out of the car and after some convincing I got him to put my son back and I left. 

The next day I went to the police dept to attempt to get a copy of the police report and find out what actually happened. They told me that the story he told me and the story he told the officers was COMPLETELY different and that they both said it was an accident and nothing happened. No one was arrested. They had me fill out a statement about what my ex told me happened and that they'd get a copy of the report to me as soon as it was done. They said they thought it was in my son's best interest to keep her away from him. 

I attempted to file an order of protection with my residence and my son as a protected party, but I was denied because OPs are apparently only for related parties. I then attempted to file a stalking no contact order and that was denied as well due to not having reasonable grounds for an emergency order. 

The cops told me that if my ex were to show up at my house they wouldn't make me give my son to him, however I'm still concerned. Do I have any right to keep my son away from his dad and his gf for now? Like I said there is no formal custody agreement. I don't want my son to have to witness any more domestic issues between them, as he is already a little shaken up by this and has been talking about how his dad's gf jumped on his dad and beat him up. The cops also said that they would have to get DCFS involved due to my son witnessing this incident. What will they do in this situation?

For context, I'm a 20 year old automotive photographer who has only been shooting cars professionally for under two years. Over the course of this time, I've shot hundreds of vehicles at events, rallys, singular glamour shots, etc. Note that I have done all of this work for FREE, and was doing it to build up a portfolio.

Recently my name in the automotive world has started to come to light, and I've had a few people reach out to me for paid gigs etc. One of these people owns an automotive 'coffee shop' and lounging area, where he wants to hang my work on the walls and sell it. I told him I love the idea however it would be far too much money for me to print/frame all these photographs myself, and would cost them $100+ per unit. They told me they understand and that they would much rather buy the RIGHTS to some of my photos and be able to print them on their own, so I wouldn't have to worry about that process. Now, this obviously raises a few concerns.

1) I would have to form some kind of contract that protects me and my work....

2) As I mentioned above, the cars I've shot were shot by me for FREE for either friends, random folks I found on instagram/facebook, events, etc. A majority of these people I don't have contact with anymore, and wonder if it would be an issue to even sell the RIGHTS of photographs taken of someone elses property... even if it's being sold as art.

In short, I have no idea what I'm doing and I don't want to make a huge mistake as a young artist to sell over the rights to my photographs and screw myself. I don't have any reason to believe these people have bad intentions, as they seemed like they wanted to have a long term relationship with me. I just want to make sure I tread lightly with this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

 We recently gave our 30-day notice for terminating our lease on a month-to-month tenancy. Our landlord sent us a message today asking us to make sure that our house is spotless and in the same condition it was delivered to us by the end of the 30 days, and confidently promised to charge us for each day that the unit is unoccupied after our lease expires while the place undergoes necessary cleaning/repairs. This seems absurd to me for the following reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I understand correctly, California law allows normal wear and tear without penalizing tenants after a tenancy ends. We have been here for over a year, and naturally there are wear-and-tear marks on the house (e.g. scuff marks from shoes on a wooden floor, hard-to-remove bits of grease residue on stove, etc.). Therefore, it is bizarre that he is asking for the place in mint condition given that it had just been renovated when we arrived.
2. If what the landlord is threatening is legally defensible, it would seem to imply that a landlord could simply claim that every day that a unit isn't rented was the result of the previous tenants' minor wear and tear to a house. 
3. Even if a unit were absolutely trashed, the landlord's claim implies the landlord could delay cleaning for months and continue charging the previous tenant simply because the trash delayed the signing of new tenants onto a new lease for months. 

If our landlord determines that we have damaged or trashed the unit (which we do not believe we have or will do), isn't the landlord's legal recourse to deduct the cost of the repairs/cleaning itself from our security deposit, and not this weird extra rent for each day the house remains damaged/trashed? 

It seems to me that the only amount we are obligated to pay is that of the cost of cleaning or repairs **beyond normal wear/tear,** and not the rent that would be owed for the number of days that the unit remains in a worse condition than how it was received by us over a year ago. Is this correct?

I had to be at work, and could not call the dealer since they were closed and it was a Saturday, I could not call until Monday. In the meantime, I ran the codes. Something came up about the transmission fluid, OD control and MAP sensor. My brother is a diesel mechanic and advised to check the transmission fluid, and that it was probably the MAP sensor causing all my issues. I fill it with ATF, clear codes and keep dealer in the loop. Fast forward a few days, I find that it needs an oil change, I get the oil changed, and continue on with life, noticing the truck has trouble getting out of 1st and 3rd after driving it a while. I go to get some better tires on it, because they were pretty worn down when I got it, on the way home, check engine light comes on again. I continue on my way home, and the transmission fluid overheats and I have to wait an hour for it to cool down to continue home. I contact their mechanic again and start a week long wild goose chase to track him down, only for him to say that there is nothing wrong with the vehicle, and barely listens to my concerns or input. I did not like his input and contacted another dealership to actually diagnose the truck. Within 2 hours they call to tell me they fixed 2 recalls (Driver airbag, and driver airbag deployment mechanism), and that they caught the truck having trouble shifting, and upon further inspection the transmission fluid was burnt and that there was debris all over the transmission. Their recommendation is to replace the entire transmission. The dealership's warranty covers 25% labor and 25% parts. But I am thinking that is wrong, and that they should cover the entire repair bill. 

So my thoughts are, they should have inspected the vehicle to see if there was any recalls to repair and replace, and if they didn't couldn't they be liable for the drivers death?

My other issue, is that they either sold it with no mechanical inspection and sold a vehicle without knowing it was defective, or they sold a vehicle they knew had issues and sold it as perfectly functional. Secondly, their mechanic completely brushed me off, and only looked at the codes, he did no further inspections. What are some things I can do legally?

I am in Indiana, and this occurred in Florida.
I will try to summarize as much as possible on this whole issue. Last November, went on vacation to an amusement park with my family.  Our last day there, we had special event tickets and were looking forward to a great day. The resort provides bus transportation to their various parks and as I am disabled (psoriatic and osteoarthritis with broken vertebrae) I was using a scooter to traverse the parks. As per every other day, I was admitted to the bus first. Strapped in and advised to remain seated on the scooter. Other guests boarded and we headed out. Halfway through the trip, the bus driver took an extremely hard turn, throwing myself and the scooter over. 
Ultimately, the bus driver did nothing to assist me and when we finally arrived at the park he left us on the sidewalk without any assistance. Once we got to the onsite clinic, I was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. It was determined that at the very least I had a ruptured disc and should follow up with Dr. at home. Pain killers were administered and the rest of the vacation was a bit fuzzy. I honestly only remember the pain of driving 18hrs home. 
Our private insurance has been taking the brunt of this since November. I've been through 2 months of physical therapy and insurance refuses to pay for an MRI to find out why I am still in pain. The amusement park has now sent paperwork to my doctor requesting that they sign off that I am done with being treated before they will discuss anything further. I don't know what to do.  
I feel like either way I go I am screwed. At this point, I cannot afford to pay for an MRI out of pocket, so any treatment is at a standstill. Shouldn't the amusement park be responsible for some of the bills? I am still in pain specific to this injury and fear I may always be.
Any advice is appreciated on what we should do next.

This included forced sexual acts (genital touching, oral, penetration), sexual comments towards me, harrassment (i.e forcing me to strip naked, pulling my towel off after getting out of the shower, etc), being made to watch pornography and groping. I also endured physical abuse during these episodes, mainly hitting/punching, biting and strangulation. 

At 14 I finally came forward about the abuse, and separated myself from my father's household. I told the therapist I was seeing at the time, who made a mandatory police report. I was called in for questioning afterwards, but the questioning process was so traumatic for me that I couldn't continue filing the report. I've gone the past years too afraid and exhausted to go back and reopen my case. I begun to reconsider after the therapist I'm seeing now asked about my case, and questioned whether or not I thought it plausible my abuser might hurt another child. He also informed me a statue of limitations wouldn't affect my case in the event I reconsidered pressing charges.

The abuse has left me significantly mentally unwell. I am still suffering from depression, self harm, anxiety, mild substance abuse issues and CPTSD. I've made multiple attempts on my own life, and have been hospitalized for both a suicide attempt and self mutilation. In the past (while I was still living with my abuser) I had also suffered from a moderate-severe eating disorder which I've since recovered from. The trauma and it's effects on my mental health make it difficult to function in my day to day life, and I constantly live in fear of coming across my abuser. I don't know if I would consider them a pedophile, but I can't say with confidence that they wouldn't abuse another child.

One of my main issues with pressing charges/applying for a restraining order or peace bond is that I don't have much substantial evidence. The physical evidence is long gone, and while I believe they took sexual photos of me as a child I have no evidence to back that up. The only sort of ""evidence"" I can think of is that, after being confronted by my father, they admitted to abusing me (and tried to justify the abuse by claiming I, a 10 year old, initiated the acts lol). I'm also concerned my case won't be taken seriously as we're both biologically female. 

Is this even worth pursuing? Just the thought of this person roaming the streets scot free has kept me an anxiety riddled mess for almost a decade, but I feel powerless to do anything to lock them up or at the very least keep them away from me. My mental health continues to degrade while they're just out living their life and it makes me sick. What if they do abuse another kid and I did nothing to prevent it? I'm still somewhat under the assumption I won't be believed or taken seriously by authorities, but it's beginning to seem more worth it to at least make an attempt.

Sorry for the rant, and thanks in advance.

EDIT: I have no idea why there's a ""Finance and Business"" flair on this post, lmao.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 10, I was groomed and repeatedly sexually abused by my stepmother&amp;#39;s child, who was 16-17 at the time. This included forced sexual acts (genital touching, oral, penetration), sexual comments towards me, harrassment (i.e forcing me to strip naked, pulling my towel off after getting out of the shower, etc), being made to watch pornography and groping. I also endured physical abuse during these episodes, mainly hitting/punching, biting and strangulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 14 I finally came forward about the abuse, and separated myself from my father&amp;#39;s household. I told the therapist I was seeing at the time, who made a mandatory police report. I was called in for questioning afterwards, but the questioning process was so traumatic for me that I couldn&amp;#39;t continue filing the report. I&amp;#39;ve gone the past years too afraid and exhausted to go back and reopen my case. I begun to reconsider after the therapist I&amp;#39;m seeing now asked about my case, and questioned whether or not I thought it plausible my abuser might hurt another child. He also informed me a statue of limitations wouldn&amp;#39;t affect my case in the event I reconsidered pressing charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abuse has left me significantly mentally unwell. I am still suffering from depression, self harm, anxiety, mild substance abuse issues and CPTSD. I&amp;#39;ve made multiple attempts on my own life, and have been hospitalized for both a suicide attempt and self mutilation. In the past (while I was still living with my abuser) I had also suffered from a moderate-severe eating disorder which I&amp;#39;ve since recovered from. The trauma and it&amp;#39;s effects on my mental health make it difficult to function in my day to day life, and I constantly live in fear of coming across my abuser. I don&amp;#39;t know if I would consider them a pedophile, but I can&amp;#39;t say with confidence that they wouldn&amp;#39;t abuse another child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my main issues with pressing charges/applying for a restraining order or peace bond is that I don&amp;#39;t have much substantial evidence.

Also, legally is there anything that can be done on our end as parents to insure that the trust isn’t being mismanaged, since the executor’s children will stand to benefit from the trust if anything was to happen to our daughter over the next 20yrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 3rd year computer science student In Irvine, California and I was recently hired at a job that has tasked me with writing a web application. The main issue I am having is that I didn't actually sign up for that job. When I came in for my first day, I was told that I would be writing this application along with another new hire, who also did not know that this is what he would be doing. The job was advertised as a mentor for younger students to teach them robotics and programming, with no mention of developing software for the company. The job was also stated to pay 12 dollars an hour, paid at the end of each month, but my boss mentioned that I would instead be paid whenever the project was done for about 1k total. I expect this project to take at least 30 hours a week for a month to finish, if not more, so basic math shows that they are paying me less than minimum wage to complete this project. On top of all of this, my partner does not have the necessary skills to develop an application such as this, and I can't blame him, because he was just thrust into a job that he was unprepared to take on.

Another aspect of this that is concerning is that I have not signed any paperwork. No contract or anything, which means that I don't know how much I will be getting paid, and there is no guarantee that there even be compensation when the app is finished. I am also unsure if I am legally employed here or not.

A dilemma that I am having is that I actually want to develop the app, as it would be an excellent addition to my resume, and it is good practice for what I want to do in the future. However, I feel as if I am possibly being used by the company to develop software for less money than they should pay.

I intend to talk with my boss about it tomorrow, and I will see what I can work out, but I also wanted to see if anyone here can give me advice on what to do. I have some more information about the process through which I was interviewed and hired, but this post is already long enough, so if you would like me to elaborate on that, I would be happy to in the comments.

Not sure about the legality of this situation but I just started working for a tow truck impound a couple weeks ago. Yesterday I had a customer come in to pick up his vehicle that was impounded and he paid by visa. When the visa slip prints it usually has an authorization code but this one didn't have one. It was our busy time of day so I just kept going as I thought maybe it was a fluke or something and released the vehicle to him. My manager informed me today that the transaction never went through and it stated that on the receipt that printed (I've never had to look at that area of the receipt before) and informed me that it would be coming out of my paycheque unless I was able to get ahold of him and convince him to come back in and pay for the impound. So now I'm looking at having $280 taken out of my paycheque which means I will struggle to be able to afford my rent this month. Apparently this isn't the first time this has happened and some people have been held responsible for bills upwards of $1300. I realize I made a mistake that cost the company money but the fact that there is no forgiveness for this or that they can dock my pay feels insane. I've never worked at a place that had a policy like this in place before. For context this seems like a pretty shady business, the sort of place that impounds vehicles and after 60 days the vehicle is owned by the company and whoever the registered owner of the vehicle is has a bill upwards of $5000 sent to collections. Any advice on this matter would be appreciated, even if it boils down to sucking it up and absorbing the cost and trying to get inventive to stretch my money for rent. Sorry for the long post it's been a really stressful day

&amp;#x200B;

In the hardest point of my life so far, my father and best friend passed away from brain cancer in May. I'm the sole executor of his will and have a question regarding his taxes.

As executor, I've arranged and paid for his funeral, burial, and paid his credit cards debts with estate funds. The estate funds are now pretty much totally exhausted (there wasn't much to begin with). I have right of survivorship to his bank account, so I don't believe those are considered Estate Funds? The car was transferred into my name before he passed, and he didn't own a house (he was renting). 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently filed his taxes for 2018 and I was told that he owed 4400 dollars. This was a huge shock to me, and obviously not ideal. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my main question: Am I expected to pay his taxes out of my own pocket now that the estate funds have been cleared out paying for his funeral expenses and credit cards? That would seem crazy to me, but I wouldn't be surprised if they expected me to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Could anyone shine some light on this for me? If anyone needs anymore information to help them answer my question then please let me know, and i'll try my best to answer as transparently as possible.

I'm only three years late but wanted to update this post. 


I reached out to the IRS who, after several phone calls and hours on hold, told me nothing could be done and to just pay up. I called one more time and a much nicer agent told me more kindly that nothing could be done unless I could get my mother to admit to withdrawing the money in writing.


I told her that if she just told the truth, admitted it to me and the IRS and wrote the letter, I would forgive her and we could put it behind us. She refused. I told her to not contact me again until she was ready to stop blaming others and admit what she had done.


A few (blissfully calm) weeks later she called me and apologized. She wrote a handwritten letter stating she withdrew the money without my knowledge and none of the proceeds went towards my care. I wrote my own letter explaining that I was already an adult immigrating to another country at the time of the withdrawal, and attached a photocopy of my passport stamps, an affidavit that I had never lived at the address the cheque was sent to, and the receipt of my immigration application which was dated prior to the withdrawal. I asked that the tax liability be transferred to my mother and included her SS number which she signed off on.


The IRS sent me a letter back stating that the taxes owing would be issued under my mother's name. Because she was a jobless crack addict, her income was under the federal threshold and she did not need to pay anything due to how low her income was that year. Disaster averted.


For those curious, no, I never got the money back and decided not to pursue it. I didn't know it existed before the IRS contacted me, and didn't feel it was in anyone's best interest to force the issue knowing that I'd never get repaid anyways. Mom quit crack a year or two back, but still battles her demons in the form of alcoholism. Our relationship has slightly improved. Also, I'm a woman (most comments assumed I was male).

Firstly, the bag got delayed at San Fransisco Airport so I decided to have the bag delivered to my home address and the delivery service which specifically states that they do not deliver after 10pm delivered my bag at 2am outside some random apartment – not my apartment. The apartment  in front of which the bag was delivered is fairly close to where I live, so I went to check if the bag was still there and unsurprisingly the bag was missing. The leasing and parcel office for the apartment haven't seen any bag of the kind, and the apartment owners say they didn't see any bag at their doorstep either. I have already filed a police report stating this situation and they are contacting the airlines to know further details.   

Additionally, the hold times for the baggage resolution center for United Airlines is around an hour every time I call which is a major pain.   

I plan on claiming compensation for the contents of the bag however  the claims process on their website shows it takes around 6 weeks to complete and I genuinely cannot wait that long. Is there any way I could get a faster resolution of the process due to the amount of inconvenience it is causing.

Both legal aide places I contacted weren't able to assist me due to budget issues.

tl;dr Month to month tenant, never late on rent. Called city due to no hot water. Landlord retaliated by filing an eviction with a non-existant corporation as the Plaintiff. Turns out he doesn't own the building. Only ordered to pay rent as it's due at Motion to Determine Rent hearing. Landlord refuses to settle for less than us saying he's right and paying all his lawyer fees plus $5000. Because of the eviction, we haven't been able to find a place to move. They either deny us outright or demand a crazy high deposit.

Month to month tenant, never late on rent, paid by personal check. Had to call the city in March due to no hot water for 2 weeks. Landlord was pissed immediately after and made threats, but calmed down and apologized the next day. All seemed fine for about 7 weeks, then we were served with an eviction complaint saying we owed 2 months rent. Never got a three day notice. Literally the only correct items on the complaint were the address of our apartment and the monthly amount.

The Inc. listed as the Plaintiff was different than the Inc. we made our checks out to. At first, we just assumed he had multiple companies like my aunt-in-law does for her properties and filed our Answer and Motion To Determine rent using the name listed on the complaint, but noted in both that our rental agreement stipulated payment to a different Inc. Last week while preparing my interrogatories and discovery, I discovered that no Inc. by that name has ever existed in Florida nor has any company by that name every paid business tax in Miami-Dade County. This isn't a typo, it appears multiple times on multiple documents, including the paperwork appointing landlord as an agent for the Inc. that was dated 2014.

After discovering that, I checked who owned the building. Turns out it's actually owned by landlord's ex-wife's LLC. I filed a motion to amend our answer with this new information, but the judge hasn't ruled on it yet.

The next parts were included in our original answer:

He claimed our first missed payment was on April 1, he posted a 3-Day Notice on April 15, filed the complaint on May 15, but claimed we owed 2 months rent on both. Our due date is the 10th of the month. There is no way for us to owe 2 months rent on both the notice and complaint unless he accepted payment after the notice because the rent became due again between the notice and complaint.

I filed a Motion To Determine Rent and raised defective 3 Day Notice, waiver for accepting rent after the alleged date posted the 3 Day Notice, and retaliation in my Answer. I attached a copy of our rental agreement (because landlord didn't), front and back check images for March, April, and May, rent reciepts for March, April, May, and the text exchanges with the city plumbing inspector.

Right about the time my landlord would have received my Answer, someone with enough information to convince FPL that they were my husband had our electricity shut off. Thankfully, we got our electricity back on in about 90 minutes. We still filed a counter claim. The judges were in the middle of rotating, so it took about 3 weeks for the MtDR hearing. Landlord hired an attorney literally the day before the hearing. The judge ruled that we owed no back rent, but didn't dismiss the case. I was too nervous to ask why he denied my motion. He ordered me to just pay rent to the court as it's due (already was) and ordered us to mediation. He also strongly advised both of us to settle.

When we were leaving court, Landlord's attorney asked me to schedule the mediation and send his an e-mail with the date and time. I did so as soon as I got home and I also sent an settlement offer that I thought was more than fair considering Landlord committed perjury. His attorney called me and said he would only settle for us saying we didn't pay rent, paying his $7000+ in costs (his attorney had only been hired 2 days before), and paying an additional $5000 for ""stress."" I literally laughed and hung up on him.

I start pouring myself into research because it's really looking like we're going to trial and I discover the information about the Inc. listed as the Plaintiff having no record of existing in Florida and the building actually being owned by Landlord's ex-wife's LLC. I filed motions to Amend my answer and counterclaim with this new information and add the landlord personally since there was no ""veil."" I'm still waiting for the judge to rule on them. Landlord's attorney called me super pissed and informed me that if I didn't ""admit I lied"" in those motions and meet the landlord's settlement demands, they would file a suit for ruining my landlord's reputation. I didn't laugh this time, but I did hang up on him again and ignored his 2 call back attempts. He hasn't filed anything yet.

Mediation is next week. I'm hoping a neutral 3rd party will knock some sense into them, but I'm not too optimistic. We've been trying to move since ""someone"" shut our electricity off, but the eviction is disqualifying us from most places and the others are asking for crazy high deposits (3-4x monthly rent) or wanting our income to be 4x monthly rent.

My questions are:

I was reading up on ""fraud upon the court"" as a possible way to get the main case dismissed, but the standard of evidence is higher than the normal civil court standard. How much higher is that bar? Do I need to prove a motive or just that 95% of his complaint is false?

I don't need another lawyer to tell me that Landlord's attorney certainly has terrible manners, but has he done anything illegal or enough to justify me filing a complaint with the bar? Should he have checked Landlord's story before taking the case? Should he have dropped Landlord once it was made clear that it was a baseless claim only brought in retaliation?

If Landlord refuses to settle and we end up going to trial, what can the judge order against Landlord when (/if) we win?

Can I request to be reimbursed for my time handling this? I was just going to list my hourly rate at $10, capped at $500.

Can my husband ask for missed wages for when he has to take off work for hearings/mediation?

Since this is happening while school is out, can we include the cost of a babysitter for our 4 kids if we need to get one for hearings/mediation?

Can Landlord be charged criminally for this?

How long will an eviction, even if we win, effect our ability to rent? Husband and I are in our 40's and we've never had an eviction before.

Is there a legal standard to calculate our future financial losses due to having a completely false eviction on our record? What data would we need to show the judge the amount we're asking for is fair?

Can the judge get in trouble for thanking me for having all my pleadings properly formatted? He didn't compliment the content, just that it was formatted correctly and made it easy for him to read. Trust me, most of the pro se arguments I've read in my research were handwritten, hot messes. Landlord's attorney seemed to think this is a major issue, though.

If there's anything else that may be useful to know, but I didn't ask, please let me know. We legit cannot afford an attorney and move. Needless to say, moving is essential because the man who has keys to our apartment has demonstrated he is perfectly willing to break the law to get back at us.

Thank you for taking time to read this.

Edited to add: Landlord's attorney made no arguements at the Motion To Determine Rent hearing. The judge looked at my checks and reciepts, asked the attorney if he had anything to say, attorney said ""No."" Judge didn't dismiss when I asked because he'd just rotated in from a city with better tenant protections and was not ""up to speed"" with tenant law for my city.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is happening within the City of Miami just in case there&amp;#39;s any city laws that may apply here.

People associate PTSD with that most often but mine stems from childhood sexual abuse. If I need to be more specific I will below: 

Cause of PTSD (trigger warning for rape): 

From when I was around 9-17 years old, my 2 older brothers would sneak into my room at night and rape me. From years of counseling, I came to figure out I was silent and just took it because I watch my mom abuse my father growing up and I didn’t want to ruin the family and add more issues so I kept it quiet. 

When it all came out, I had to deal with the court throughout my senior year in high school. My mother blamed me and called me a whore. When I went off to college, I tried to overdose to kill my self. I was saved at the hospital but not without ruining my stomach (so I get ulcers now). I was almost kicked from the university for being a threat but in order to stay, I had to see a counselor 2 times a week and see someone to get on medication while also meeting with an advisor. I did all of that and got my bachelors degree. 

Skip ahead 10 years, I am working my dream job but because of a new structure to the job and the company I work for got sold and a lot of changes are taking place, my stress has exploded. We don’t get bonuses anymore which were almost a guarantee. I can’t afford anything. I am so stressed that I had a mental breakdown and started breaking things in my apartment. This is not me. This is not who I am or want to be. I probably have spent an hour or so at work crying everyday for the last week. 

My nightmares of my brothers still happen from time to time. I am scared to sleep 99% of the time and need to sleep with the tv going so I don’t feel alone and trick my mind to feel secure that if anyone comes to rape me, it will sounds like there’s people awake and a light. But all of this is increasing with the new added stress. 

I almost can’t manage myself anymore. I had a migraine for 3 days straight and now a headache for another 3 days straight. 

My mind constantly forgets to do everyday things like eat, feed the cats, call family/boyfriend, ect. And my mind constantly just goes blank/black. I will be talking to my boyfriend and then go blank, like a light randomly turned off. When I do remember to eat, I can’t stop eating until I feel sick. 

There’s just so much and I feel like giving up. I been able to manage it with a job that wasn’t stressful and let me go at my own pace but now I have to do twice as much work with less money and if I keep this up, I feel I will eventually end up at the hospital for suicidal thoughts again. I was feeling this stress and suicidal at my last full time job too (both graphic design jobs) and was sent to the hospital by my employer but was fired a couple months later. 

I know I can physically work. I don’t want to be someone who uses disability as an excuse not to work but I have stuff to pay and emotionally/mentally, I feel I am just about to explode and give up on life. I also feel so stupid asking on Reddit but I honestly have no idea where else to ask. 

Also, the flare looked like it could have gone under a couple different topics but I picked the best I could.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let me clarify I did not get PTSD from any military action.

I live in a small town in Nova Scotia. I have a two bedroom apartment with my girlfriend and dog. 

My downstairs neighbour, a man around seventy always  throws garbage and food on the lawn. It is a regular occurrence since I moved here and there has been numerous complaints already made about it since before I had lived here as well. The landlord isn’t ever around so nothing is done about it. 

Yesterday, I had an incident with the downstairs neighbour. I picked up the garbage on the lawn and put it on his step to deal with. He came outside yelling and telling me to fuck myself. I asked the man what his problem is, and he shoved me and said he’s going to “make me a fucking cripple”. He takes a step back and grabs a baseball bat from behind his door. He raises it up, and I grab it from his hands. I tell him he’s a nut job and I’m calling the cops (big mistake).

So I call, but he did too and claimed I threatened him. When I talked to the cops I gave them back the geezers bat since I didn’t want the thing. No idea if they gave it back.  I hope not but yeah. He wasn’t charged or anything. 

So, if I let him hit me would it be assault but since i took it from him he doesn’t get charged? I don’t understand and I’m frustrated because this old cunt still lives downstairs. Im not scared of him but I am concerned he’ll fuck with my girlfriend, my dog, or my car. I can’t be here 100% of the time.

(PA) My dad was in the Marines when he was younger so when he died (3 years ago) he got buried in a Veteran's Cemetery. I didn't have to pay anything for the funeral/burial/gravestone because he was a veteran so the government paid for it. Due to living so far away and not even really wanting to go (yes I know this sounds horrible but if you knew everything that happened you would understand), I was unable to make it to the burial and I have not been to cemetery at all. Well I have moved somewhat closer to the cemetery and I looked it up online to see how far away I was. When I was on the website, I seen that I could look a picture of the gravestone. My dad's name is wrong on the gravestone. He has 2 middle names and on the gravestone it only has the initial of one of his middle names. 

My question is how can I get the cemetery to add his second middle name initial? Can they even do that? I'm not looking to sue them or get money for it or anything. I'm sure it was an honest mistake. Even when you go on the website and look him up, his name only has his one middle name on it instead of both.

&lt;p&gt;(PA) My dad was in the Marines when he was younger so when he died (3 years ago) he got buried in a Veteran&amp;#39;s Cemetery. I didn&amp;#39;t have to pay anything for the funeral/burial/gravestone because he was a veteran so the government paid for it. Due to living so far away and not even really wanting to go (yes I know this sounds horrible but if you knew everything that happened you would understand), I was unable to make it to the burial and I have not been to cemetery at all. Well I have moved somewhat closer to the cemetery and I looked it up online to see how far away I was. When I was on the website, I seen that I could look a picture of the gravestone. My dad&amp;#39;s name is wrong on the gravestone. He has 2 middle names and on the gravestone it only has the initial of one of his middle names. &lt;/p&gt;

They stayed in my apartment and their sole purpose for the week was to pet sit. 

Sometime during the beginning of the week, they were playing with my dog and pulled too hard on the toy resulting to severely hurt him. According to what they said: something flew out of his mouth (tooth, or peace of his gum) and then he started to bleed uncontrollably. 

They had my number and could have called, but chose not too. They also chose not to take him to the veterinary. They left him to bleed and to drown in a pool of infection. 

When I came back, they didn't tell me right away. One of them told me what happened hours after I came back...

I took my dog to the vet and got antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, but the vet said we can't continue to give him those because the swollen area hasn't gotten any better. She suggested a series of tests, i.e. radiology, along a multitude of other tests to determine the issue. The estimate for that is over 500$. 

Whenever I bring the situation up to them they assign the blame on me and tell me that I'm exaggerating, that it was an accident and to basically do nothing. They are refusing to take responsibility for their actions, or lack of.

I wanted to take them to court from the get go, but my whole family advised me against it because it would ruin our friendship. I didn't know of the consequences and I was put in a difficult situation. 

My question is: can I take them to civil court even though 6 months have passed and have them take responsibility for what happened and make them pay for the veterinary bills? 

Multiple people have told me that I can, others have said I would lose the case and that it's too late...

Kaiser Permanente sent my mother a bill including very private medical information I never ever wanted to share with my parents. 

I found out because my mom called me letting me know. I was furious with Kaiser. 


I called and throughout a 30 minute called was told that ‘this happens sometimes’. 

I am on my own insurance and have not been on my parents plan for several years. Prior to being in my own, I was also apart of Kaiser - on my parents plan. 

Kaiser claimed that because I was on record twice, on my parents plan in the past (non current) and now on my own they ‘didnt know where to send the bill’ so they just picked on. 

What the actual fuck?! 

Do I have any legal claim to maybe sue Kaiser? 

They never updated their system in regards to me as a patient, therefore my VERY private medical procedures are now fully known by my parents. 

Kaiser’s associate I talked to literally admitted this happens to other people too! 

Again, what the actual fuck?! 


I am gay, I had a scare, and now my parents know ALL the details. 

What if I get excommunicated from my family?
What if this information my parents learned completely changes how they feel about me?
What if I wasnt out and Kaiser just outted me?

So much so that recently they took a wine bottle opener with a flip out blade to school and when they got caught with it at school they made the most bizzar story about killing kangaroos with it and using that as the meat for dinner. 

We have tried multiple punishments with no changes in their attitudes. We have tried to comfort them knowing that they miss their mother and it is out of our control to get her to visit as she lives more than 2,500km away.

8 days ago we received a visit from child services (Office of Children and Families here in Australia). Where they stated they had concerns for the welfare of the children. Not knowing the exact complaints we had an idea as they asked frequently about the kids being assaulted and going without food. 

They continued to ask about their mother and the situation around that issue and I told them everything they needed to know, produced documents for everything they needed, they spoke with the 2 kids, and they were on their way. 

It seemed odd to me that they would mention assault as we are entirely against it. We do have food and aren't exactly struggling. But, the officer kept quoting one of the kids saying ""they miss their mum and want to go live with them"". 

As they are in councilling, their therapists frequently talk to us openly about any concerns they have and not one time have they brought up anything familiar about this scenario. 

I asked the boys if they had any idea where they might have got this information and my eldest said that he ""tells the teacher that we hit him because he wants to leave us and live with his mum"".

i have been in my rental for 4years now. about a year ago, i spoke to the building manager about flooring damage in my bathroom. he took a pic, mentioned he'd address it to the landlord who lives on site as does he, and no follow up.

i've since covered up the bathroom with rugs, and now have noticed the damage has gotten worse- water damage, and some cracking in floor. i know the floor is going to have to be replaced. i'm not sure if it would be all the bathroom floor or just that half where the damage is. it's a small small bathroom. i'm in the bay area (CA) 

my question is - would i be liable for the costs ? even after their negligence to repair it prior to it getting worse?  is it a better idea to bring it up again before i move out? my deposit is only 700$ which is half the rent, so i assume i could be billed for more ?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm living in Sweden. Me and some friends want to make an investment in a hedge fund based in Cayman Islands. To meet the minimum ticket size we're going to pool together money through a partnership. In Sweden this is pretty straight forward from a legal perspective, we register an investment club (""aktiesparklubb"" in swedish) and appoint someone as the controlling person. The purpose of this newly created entity is solely to invest 100% of the money in the hedge fund and (hopefully) earn passive interest/dividends. 

&amp;#x200B;

In order to invest and meet CRS/FATCA/KYC requirements for the hedge fund, we obviously need to fill out a plethora of compliance docs.  My question is if our partnership classifies as a Passive NFFE or Active NFFE? Or if I got it all wrong and it classifies as something else?

&amp;#x200B;

Thankful for any help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

We are on Long Island in New York State.  The financial agreement at this time was flexible, due to him living with me in my previous residence for three years and six months for *free*.  (His home was under reconstruction due to Hurricane Sandy damages.) After moving into his house, I paid the majority of the utility bills, he paid the entirety of the mortgage and occasional utilities (all of which are in his name).  In addition, I furnished 95% of the home, purchase 100% of all groceries and toiletries, and paid for bi-weekly cleaning services. In February, 2019, I paid him $500 toward his mortgage in cash. (I know...) I am a habitual receipt hoarder and (usually) meticulous record keeper. 

Beginning in approximately March 2019 to present day, we have been steadily heading towards terminating the relationship.  At times we are at odds, he makes consistent and frequent threats to evict me and/or remove my belongings from the home.  Occasionally, we will have a few good days and behave as if everything is fine.  Rinse, repeat.  Because of this, I began to pay the utilities less frequently (in order to financially prepare to relocate).  On June 20, 2019, our gas was shut off.  On 6/23, he verbally agreed to split the cost of the total amount due to restore service ($500).  On 6/24, I made a payment of $95 toward the gas. . No additional payments have been made. We are still without gas (hot water, access to the stove, etc.) I have been taking showers at family and friend’s houses. 

On 6/30, we got into yet another verbal altercation, causing him to threaten eviction (again) and threatened physical harm when I refused (this one really escalated). On 7/1, he moved his homeless brother who has a criminal record into the home (in an effort to intimidate me into moving?) He seems under the impression this homeless brother is going to be of more financial assistance to him. 
The house we live in is strange/unique/not practical whatsoever; the master bedroom is on the third floor of the home and does not contain a door of any kind (it simply has a staircase leading up to it, and BAM there’s our/my bed!) Yesterday, in order to make room for his brother’s four trash bags consisting of the entirety of his belongings, he decided to partially empty a closet with my belongings in it. He placed these items on the floor of my bedroom, (not damaging them). (I’m unsure of why he simply did not ask me to move these items myself.) I really do not wish to go “tit-for-tat” with this person, but preventing me from storing my belongings anywhere besides the floor and/or furniture I’ve purchased is childish. (I might as well lock up all the dishes and toilet paper while I’m at it!)

My questions are as follows: are my rights that of a licensee or a co-tenant? Can he legally move additional persons into the home, even though my bedroom has no door/partition (construction was prohibited on this floor at time of receipt of the certificate of occupancy)? Can I legally prohibit him from sleeping in my bed? (As I’ve mentioned, ALL furniture in the home was purchased by me with receipts readily available.)

The OP was from November 2014, but I thought I should update. To recap: Mom's lawyer wanted her to settle her workers comp case for 4.5 years of payments, but we disagreed.  Feel free to skip to tl;dr below.

Shortly after that post, I had Mom schedule an in-person meeting with me and her lawyer and legal aid (it was all over the phone/email with the legal aid up until now). 

One infuriating thing: Luckily I read up on WC law in PA because the legal aid tried getting Mom to settle with deception wording.  While we were waiting for the lawyer to enter the room, the legal aid said something like:

&gt; You know, by law, you're only allowed to collect disability for ten years, but you won't get more than five, and you've already been collecting for over two years. So, 4.5 years is more than generous.

Which is deceptive in her wording because according to that same law, the 500 week (ten year) counter doesn't start until disability has been decided as partial, and that hasn't yet been decided. So, the time Mom's already collected (2+ years at that point) doesn't count towards the 500 weeks limit.  I said as much to the legal aid, and she broke eye contact, agreed, and just restated that it's still a generous offer. I lost all trust in that legal aid after that.

Come to find out, the legal aid wasn't relaying any of Mom's complaints to the lawyer or the insurance company. For example, the insurance company wasn't paying Mom's medical bills, and Mom told the LA this several times. When the lawyer heard this, she was upset and told her aid to get it resolved now, and it was resolved 30 minutes later. After this meeting, the lawyer was much more sympathetic towards Mom's position.

I bring that up because apparently the insurance company simply forgot about Mom. Their automated system was cutting the bi-weekly check but not paying the medical bills. LOL. In that, the insurer missed a two-year (plus 60 days) deadline to petition for a reduction in benefits. Which means they could still request a medical exam twice every year to change the status, but by missing the deadline, it gives Mom more time to collect.

But now the insurer had Mom on the radar.  They sent her to be examined twice every year.  The doctors were very shady. Their reports would vary wildly but always said that Mom was able to go back to work.  In one instance, Mom couldn't even finish the test because it was causing so much pain.  The doctor put down that she was fully healed and 0% disabled. That same doctor performed that same test six months later and found Mom to be 11% disabled. Six months after that, she was 5% disabled according to that same doctor.  His report would even put down incorrect details, such as which hand was hurt (left vs right) and what angle she was able to move her arm, etc.  Another doctor's notes said that she shouldn't use her arm at all until further notice, but then in the exam report which goes to the insurer, he reported that she was 100% fully recovered and should go back to work immediately with no limitations.

But none of that apparently mattered.  The lawyer said that the insurer's doctors are paid to do exactly that, but if the insurer actually believes them, they will try to reduce the WC payments.  She was right.  Even though all of their doctors were reporting that Mom is recovered and able to go back to work, the insurer never petitioned to reduce WC payments.

Payments continued for nearly another 5 years.

Then, a few months ago, Mom, her lawyer and the insurers met in arbitration to settle. Regrettably, I couldn't be there because of work obligations. The insurers offered Mom 4.5 years settlement and perpetual medical coverage for the work injuries. Mom's lawyer said that's the best offer that she'll ever get (although, they said this with every single offer ever presented), and Mom accepted the offer.

Also, Mom found out that all of the ""offers"" that came from the insurer were first solicited by the lawyer, including the most recent request for arbitration.  Meaning that the insurers only made settlement offers after being requested for each one by Mom's own lawyers, even though Mom made it clear that she didn't want to settle.  I can almost sympathize with them because they were working on contingency, but it still seems like acting in bad faith to me.

So anyway, after seven years of collecting WC, Mom received one final settlement check for 4.5 years (minus lawyer fees, etc).  Personally, I think it was a mistake to settle, but I don't live in Mom's shoes.  She's tired of the painful medical exams and arguing against her own lawyer who wants her to settle, and I can hardly blame her. I'm just really afraid that she'll spend the money and then live in destitute -- she's awful with money.

He makes vulgar sexual comments about violating my body, says he is building a life for us and will come get me when it’s ready wether I want him to or not, says I am family and he loves me, says I get off on ignoring him, demands he see me because “there’s something he needs from me.” They are long, tangential, scary, and demanding messages. He stated he is going to my parents house in our home town this weekend to “talk some sense into them.” This terrified me. I have only returned his messages once in 2012 when I simply stated not to ever speak to me or my loved ones again. Nothing more. I have a professional job in the public eye and am not able to advertise myself on a website anymore, I can’t even have linked in because he will find it and then come to where I am. I made one when I first left gradschool and he was contacting me at work and through linked in within days. I had had to change my email and avoid social media to avoid him. 

Is there anyway for me to get this guy to leave me alone? It’s hindering my ability to advertise in my career, it’s giving me nightmares, and is honestly just feels violating. I feel helpless against it. 

I tried calling a local law group but they said they were  in family law and couldn’t help me. I have no idea how to access the appropriate resources. Any tips to get me headed in the right direction? Or am I stuck with this harassing stalker forever?

I again spoke to another customer couple days later, and at the beginning they told that I have to check with the dealership and they cannot do anything about it.

So this started back in December as a leak above my shower. Maintenance took 2 months to ""fix"" it and in that time I started having asthma attacks and sinus infections. 

A couple weeks ago I was taking a shower when a thick layer of paint broke open and cold water went everywhere.  I found out their ""fix"" was painting over the issue and not fixing the leak.

After removing the thick layer of paint my entire bathroom ceiling was covered in black mold, cracked, and sinking in. I felt really sick (asthma, chronic migraines, sinuses, fatigue ect.) and asked multiple times for them to fix it.

2 weeks later they cut out my ceiling revealing moldy beams and insulation in my ceiling (to the point where it is actually eating away at the structure and smells as you would imagine). The maintenance man told me that, and I quote, ""Everywhere has mold, it can't make you sick,
 I took a class on it."" So they dont plan on fixing the mold issue past putting in a new ceiling. I'm scheduled to have it put in, which will cover all of the ""evidence"" of this mold issue.

I have been having so many health issues after my first few months living here that a month ago I resigned from my job because I constantly felt sick and didnt know why. Now I know.

Are there actions I can take to (quickly) get me out of this environment? My doctor agrees that I need to get away from this mold since I had allergy testing in the past and am very allergic. 

I also have documented (samples in bags, work order requests, pictures ect.) of all these events, I just dont know what to do. My lease isn't up for a few more months. I have no idea if there are even any laws to protect against mold. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Display and promotion
Tobacco products and branded tobacco product accessories (for example, lighters):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;must be hidden from view until a customer buys them
cannot be handled by a customer before they’ve bought them
cannot be promoted in a retail store&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Background, I work in the halloween horror industry, and have been working with this attraction since 2014, fast forward to March of 2019. We receive notice that this year, our attraction will not be opening up this year(due to budget concerns, and location issues). Going through our contract, I see that we signed a non-compete agreement that last for one year from the last date of employment(late October of 2018), and says we are not to work with another company within a distance of 60 miles of said attraction(new attraction is approximately 59.6 miles away). This is a small company with there being two owners, two managers, and a staff of around 50ish without a halloween job this year.

Personally, I would want to work at this new location, since it is a seasonal job that works well with my schedule and can help me earn some extra money right before the holiday season, and its a fun job that leads into some really awesome opportunities during the off season.

My question is,

1. Do I still have to follow that non-compete agreement since company is no longer in operations?
2. What could the punishment be if said owner found out I did break our non compete?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Missouri)&lt;br/&gt;

* This is a college town, nearly all of the apartment complexes are low quality - especially the place I'm talking about here.
* My SO and I lived here because we're both broke, full-time students.
* We're located in Michigan, USA.
* When you move into a new place, almost all of them (and this might be everywhere, but I'll still explain it) make you fill out a move-in checklist. You go room to room noting all of the damages in the apartment before you move in.

&amp;#x200B;

My SO and I moved out of our old apartment on May 31st of this year. When our lease began last August, we filled out a move-in checklist pretty thoroughly. Since the apartment complex is cheap student housing, most of the rooms needed to have something written, i.e. kitchen cabinet doors were falling off, carpet was separating at the bottom of the stairs, etc. Something I specifically remember writing for just about *every* room was that the walls were covered in marks/scuffed up/dirty.

The apartment complex/their management did not contact us once to get the damages we initially reported on the checklist taken care of. After a couple of days living there, we realized the dishwasher didn't work too, so we contacted them and had someone sent out. Another couple of days later, the dishwasher breaks again and another service guy is sent out. Well, it broke again so we said fuck it and washed dishes by hand all year since they weren't going to fix it correctly. The apartment complex also repaints all of the unit's doors once a year. When those guys came by, one of them told us our kick plate below the door was broken - nothing ever came of that either, even when they were the ones who noticed it. I mention these things to give context towards how unresponsive and slow-to-act the complex was throughout the duration of our lease. Keep in mind that all of our initially reported damages still weren't taken care of and never did get taken care of.

Fast forward to a week ago and we get a bill in the mail for $390. There were $140 in damages for 3 pairs of blinds and a towel bar; while we don't agree with the ridiculous up-charge on that, we have no problem paying it. However, there is a $250 charge to repaint the walls throughout the apartment; the itemized list they gave us literally says ""paint up bedrooms, marks on walls."" The bill they sent us is dated June 27th 2019, and it says verbatim:

&gt;In accordance with MI law, balance due must be received and paid in full no later than 7 days to eliminate court papers. Court papers will be filed for any outstanding balance and court costs will be your responsibility.   
&gt;  
&gt;You must respond to this notice by mail within 7 days after receipt of same, otherwise you will forfeit the amount claimed for damages.

We left for vacation on Wednesday, June 26th and returned home on Monday, July 1st. I saw the bill that Monday night when we got home and emailed the apartment complex on Tuesday while I was at work. In my first email, sent around 1:30pm on Tuesday, I asked for an itemized list, not realizing that there was already one attached to the back of the bill they sent us. Later that night when I realized we had the itemized list already, I sent a second email asking why we were being charged to repaint the walls when they were never repainted for us when we first moved in. How can they be sure the damages were from us and not the last tenant if they never painted them for us? Regardless, we did not receive an email back from them Tuesday or Wednesday, and because of the holiday weekend, they're closed today through next Monday. 

Since we have only 7 days to submit payment or they'll take us to court, do I have to pay them? They have failed to communicate with me at all about the charges, our move-in checklist shows that the walls were dirty when we first moved in, and they definitely don't have a work order stating they came to service our apartment because it never happened. Also, since today is a holiday, does that affect the due date of this bill? Am I legally obligated to pay the $390 now? If I have to, is there a way I can recover the $250 after the fact from them? I'm sure they will still not paint our apartment for the next tenants and then pull the same shit on them too, claiming that they dirtied the walls while they fail to ever repaint them.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little background information: &lt;/p&gt;

1) What should my mom do?
2) Is she going to jail?

We can't afford a lawyer to support her. But she is now on her way to Public Attorneys Office.

Help us out please. She can't take too much stress because she hasn't fully recovered yet, that's why I'm really worried about her health. She's the only one left in our province with my 7 year old little brother. I'm in Manila studying and my Dad is in the city, working, too.

Ps. I'm not sure if I gave unnecessary details but I just really wanna put in anything that I think could help my mom solve this problem.

I was accused of DUI because the police found CBD oil in my car.

Because of that they forced me to take blood test. In blood test they found thc equal to 0.2 Blood alcohol content.

By norwegian all drug substances in blood is calculated into Blood Alcohol content.

And all substances which equal to over 0.2 blood alcohol content is considered DUI.

I refuses the search but they search anyways because it “smelled weed”

I am a Canadian. I moved to France on August 12, 2018 with a Holiday Working Visa. It's a deal that Canada has with France where youths (people under 35) can travel and work abroad to pay for their travels in select countries. During 2018, I was never in France consecutively for more than 6 months. I traveled to other parts of Europe, and being in Asia for about 3 weeks. I worked in 2018, taking various jobs such as babysitting and teaching English.

Fast forward to June 2019, I was coming back from 10 days in Toronto (visiting family, etc.). Before heading to Toronto, I purchased a few luxury items for my friends and family. I also purchased some jewelry at the Cartier store at the DUTY FREE SHOP at the airport. I received my TVA back (VAT taxes) because I thought I could. I didn't consider myself a resident. At this point, I have an APS (Autorisation Provisoire Sejour) - not even a regular visa. When I returned to Paris from Toronto, I was stopped by 3 douane (custom) officers. I didn't understand why they stopped me and went through my entire luggage. It was if they were looking for something - they asked whether I had a watch and I don't but they saw my bracelets and interrogated where I got it. Anyway, they kept me for over 3 hours, with 3 officers, and charged me. The officers charged me a total of 1700 euros for the following:

\- claiming TVA refund when I shouldn't because I am considered a resident - I was charged 20% TVA for all items purchased (even tho my refund was only 12%)

\- purchasing jewelry at the duty free shop and then coming back to France with it - apparently I am not allowed to bring the goods back to the country

Can someone confirm if I am a french resident? I rent in France and I work with a CDI under the APS visa. At first it was Holiday Working Visa which was renewed to APS. I never filed taxes in France for 2018 because my income was small. I filed my taxes as a Canadian resident. I was also never in France for more than 6 months consecutive for 2019 at the time. I asked a few lawyer friends and some stated that they don't think I am a resident. I am really hoping someone on this forum can give me some guidance. I am traumatized by the whole experience. I feel bullied. I don't know why it took 3 officers to detain me. ALSO, one of the officers made a really judgmental remark. I told him I could not afford to pay 1700 euros in fees. I explained to him my financial situation. He said to me with the following ""You have no money to pay when you own a gucci bag, a dior bag, etc."".... that's when I stood up for myself and said he was being a judgmental prick. I made the money in Toronto with my career, but now I moved to France with nothing to explore a different culture. He has no right to judge my circumstances.

About 18 months ago my parents moved into my mother’s childhood home. It stayed in the family and my grandmother moved, telling my parents they could do what they like with the property. My grandmother still owns the property and rents it to my parents for $1/year. It is a large house with a mother-in-law apartment with a private entrance around the back of the property. This is where my parents live, them not needing much space.

When they moved in, they began a short-term rental business (AirBnB) by renting out the “main” house. It is beautiful. They put months of work into it. They made the entire property look better than it has since my mother’s childhood. It’s gorgeous.

One day about a year ago, my parents rented the main house to a family of 4 (the parents in their 70s and the children in their 50s) who were touring the country on motorcycles. When one of my parents’ nosy grumpy old lady neighbors saw these motorcycles in their driveway, she went on a social media rampage saying my parents were harboring “Hell’s Angels” and they were jeopardizing the safety of the neighborhood. YEAH.

So, this old lady (early 80s) gathered up all of her old lady friends in the neighborhood to make it their mission to shut down my parents’ business. They complained loudly enough that the city asked my mother to shut down the business. (No other short-term rental properties in the area were affected- only my parents’ and only because these old ladies complained the loudest.) They were booked constantly when they were operating in the beginning, meaning in the year they have been not allowed to operate, they have missed out on about $20,000 of income.

Now, a year later, my parents have been in a battle with city officials to allow them to resume business for months. After threatening to sue the city for discrimination for shutting down one STR in a city of about 90 STRs, the city has agreed to allow them to resume. The group of 5 old ladies are livid. They are doing everything they can to bully my parents and get them to move out of the neighborhood. They are driving by taking pictures of cars in the driveway, calling the cops over “suspicious cars in the driveway” (side note, it was my car), attacking them on social media, waiting by the driveway and telling renters they are unwelcome, following my parents to city council meetings (attempting to intimidate them for some reason?), and generally making their lives miserable.

My parents are such good people, they volunteer at homeless shelters, cook for church gatherings, and advocate for their community in every way they can. They do not deserve to be treated like this. They feel they have no options in any way to stop this. The neighbors are not setting foot on their property, just standing/waiting in front of it and beside the driveway. They don’t feel they are being threatened physically at any point. They are just so angry and sad that they can’t live their own lives without their neighbors making them miserable.

The old ladies’ goal is to bully them out of the house and move. This is not an option for them. Is there anything that can be done other than move or cease operating the rental?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long backstory- Edit: Location is Northwest Alabama&lt;/p&gt;

Recently they have built a garage on the edge of their property, we didn't mind as it was on their side. After the garage was built they put in a gravel pad for their trailer which I noted was on our side.

They put in property stakes and still built the pad on our side.

They have trespassed before \[ie. coming onto our yard to look over the cliff, walk across the yard, drive their trailer across our yard, and even harass our previous tenant.\]

I have been living at home with my parents without a formal contract between us. The general consensus is that I pay $450 a month, plus my own car insurance and other expenses. Health insurance, it’s cheapest (for my mother and myself) for me to be on her health insurance. Gas, I pay for, and car insurance I pay for (to my parents. 300$ cash), though I have no vehicle of my own and am allowed to borrow my father’s truck (which has been promised, ‘given’, offered for purchase) or the family vehicle. Utilities are included in my parent’s rent of the apartment. I pay for my own groceries and do my own cooking. I do not pay for phone expenses and they refuse to allow me to despite my requests to be able to— I believe as a control method, as they request their phone back for any misbehavior. I do not pay for internet either, as it’s bundled with the landline. 

There are always miscellaneous expenses tacked on to the end of month — I left a dish or two in the sink 10$, I didn’t clean the cat box daily 10$, etc — and my rent is due a month behind.  So I pay for June’s rent at the start of July. I tried to keep track, only to be yelled at for “nitpicking” and told, emphatically, I am incorrect, no matter how carefully I track. In April, I tried to pay extra one month so I would, like the rest of the world, pay for the upcoming month. 

Miraculously, by the end of the month, I managed to rack up $450 in miscellaneous expenses (that I don’t remember ever doing, and they could not give more than vague explanations) and was back to paying a month behind, and any attempts to explain otherwise have been met with solid resistance. I am not given a receipt because “we’re family” and it’s cash because it’s easiest for them. 

I have been uneasy for years about this situation, as I was kicked out at 17 for a week for going to prom in a tux, and I do not trust them. At all. 

I want to know the legality, for certain, of a number of things. Sorry if they are stupid questions, but I can’t exactly ask my parents. 

1. I was not allowed time to read the lease of the apartment (between tenants and the landlords of the apartment) because my parents pressured me. I’m not sure of how to prove that, if I can at all. This has occurred every year since I became an adult tenant. 
2. They’re not on the up and up with my rent, are they? I am pretty sure about this but would like confirmation. 
3. Is there a way to request a copy of my lease from my landlord? Just ask them, or is there a more involved process?
4. Is there a legally viable way to keep track of the money I give them, or would it be a he-said-she-said situation? As of this moment I have a list, and bank statements confirming the amounts removed, but I don’t believe those are adequate. 
5. Am I at risk of being evicted for non payment of rent, if my parents claim I haven’t paid? This is my biggest concern.

We just got a Whole Foods in the area and if there are tons of studies about how that affects prices as well. That’s the good stuff.

Now to the reason I’m here. One month after moving in (February) I had to replace a portion of my roof due to leaks in the master bathroom. Neither the seller or home inspector took any responsibility for this. The contractor used, mentioned the roof accessories and installation was done very poorly and should not have passed inspection. None the less I took this $3K cost in the chin and paid it expecting it to be a single incident.

Fast forward a few months, there is water damage to the carpet of the basement. First off it makes no sense to have carpet in a moist area but there is. Because of this and other intrusions there is mold there as well. To add to the laundry list there is also water damage in both of my bathrooms as the plumbing was not properly installed. Lastly (I know it’s a lot) I just got done spending another $4K fixing a sewage leak that literally had sewage exiting into my backyard.

At this point I’ve spent $7K in less than 6 months and am about to spend a bit more to fix the bathrooms and basement / mold. My insurance should assist with some of this but that still isn’t the point. I had the home inspected from a referral from my realtor and absolutely none of these defects were made known to me before buying or in a sellers disclosure statement. 

Lastly, I know there is often a question of “How much did the seller or renovation team know?” Two quick things here. I recently found an old beat up floor fan in an unfinished room of my basement that the construction team left behind. Now why would you have one of those? Also, for the sewage, the plumbing team took pictures of multiple configurations that don’t meet code (I’m not technical, but they have to do with L sharped turns, materials used, literally jamming a pipe into a broken pipe, and finally connecting my line to my neighbors).

Quite the list I know - and not a great first time home buying experience. Literally nothing surprises me about how shitty of a job the renovation team/ seller did in this home anymore. Please advise or let me know if any good lawyers that have won cases similar to this.

We live in a Condo Association and have a corrupt HOA president that runs the building and has been harassing my now disabled mother. My grandma own’s the property and on the signing of the contracts my mother and I were approved as residents to life there with background checks and all. It was contingent that we wouldn’t close the contract when buying the property if we were not approved to live there.

We lived here for 5 years and on the 5th year my mother suffer a stroke and became disabled. She is married but separated from her husband. After the stroke her husband stepped up to care for her and he moved into her condo. The president of the HOA didn’t like this. She began to pester us saying his nurses/aides were not allowed to use the guest parking and started questing why we had so many, and saying he’s not allowed to live there. My mother just had a stroke and was released. We needed all the help we could get but the HOA didn’t seem to care. We complained about the guest parking situation and in return they took away our very OWN parking spot that is considered our property in the bylaws. They started putting tow-stickers and threatened to have our car towed and said we are not allowed to park there anymore. We were furious about that knowing my mother is disabled and needs close access to the vehicle. We complained and demanded this stop. In retaliation our name was removed out of the directory box in the building. We could no longer buzz guest in. My mother lives on the 16th floor and could no longer let aides/rehab/nurses in. Someone would have to go down and my father wasn’t always home to do that.

Shortly after getting our name removed my mother suffered a mini heart attack at midnight and it took the paramedics an extra 10 minutes to get into the building because the doors are closed and they couldn’t get buzzed in by my father. Again we were furious, my mother could of died. Every second counted, we pleaded with the president of the building expressing that this situation is harassment towards a disabled woman and could of turned fatal and in retaliation and they sent out a letter from a lawyer demanding that we give them the original copies of our background checks and approval certifications from the board from when we first moved in. My guess is they want to destroy it or take them then deny we have rights or ever were approved to live there.

The president of the building is constantly harassing and hurting someone who is disabled. It’s disgusting and turning dangerous, we weren’t on the best terms before because of our religion and our concerns with some of the financial matters in the building. Hundreds of thousands are being spent and their are no proper receipts on where it is going. That is the least of our concerns now but we know they are using my mother’s disability as a way to really destroy us knowing we are battling this health issue and don’t have the power to fight back.

I am a small business owner.  I am the only person registered with the state and city for the business.  I actually have a business partner though, but they is not listed.

Because I am the only person on the business, our business bank account is under my name and they are 2ndary. 

Lately we have been having disputes and they have given their self a couple of raises. They aren't much but they add up, and I have not agreed to any of them, nor have I received any raises as well.  I don't know what to do.  I have spoken with my business friends and they said it would be a potentially costly legal battle, unless i take it to small claims.  I feel like i have no recourse, there is no employee or wage contracts with the person.  The first ""raise"" I had no idea about until months later when i looked at the numbers, and no paper trail about because we did a handshake agreement and they took a raise from what we agreed upon at the beginning, so I don't think I can really do anything about that.  but recently they gave their self another raise, a nominal amount, but still.  I feel like I have no recourse so my only option is to start over, fresh.

There is no pre-nuptial agreement, when we were first married I was the only partner with assets, and I just assumed if things went awry I would be able to divide those from marital.  My mistake.

I own the TN house outright; it's valued around $300k.  We are currently planning an uncontested divorce with a marital separation agreement prepared online (we plan to consult a lawyer and CPA jointly) where I would buy her out for about 25% of the worth of the home:  $50k in a one time payment at the time of the divorce, and $500/month alimony over 5 years (or however the lawyer advises/structures it).  I am not flush with cash at the moment, most of my wealth/money is tied up in the equity of our home.

My wife is currently, secretly dating another man.  Should I just blow that off because I am getting a good deal at un-contesting the divorce with a 25% buyout or is it worth it to look into contesting the divorce and getting her to settle for less:  I'm thinking 10%.  She is also getting a car that is the result of an insurance payment during our marriage.  I plan to keep mine [EDIT:(pre-marital asset)].  They are equal in value.

What are my options?  Play it cool and coast to uncontested divorce land with a 25% wealth hit, or consult an attorney on the side?

My bf's ex-wife has said that she has filed for divorce and that her process server has attempted to serve him at our adrdress but out property manager (apartments) has escorted him off the premesis.

I have been permanently  bannend form a online game for cheating. This ban is not correct and a lot of other players have questions about this ban, because it does not feel's fishy. i have talked to the team for over 7 months with no succes in site. With there privacy policy they are not allowed to give away specifieks about the ban. only the reason and the players involved. With little to information has been hard to make a case to plead my innocence. not long ago i watched a video about a guildwars 2 player that got falsely banned, and the support team was little to no help. Only with a DSAR he could obtain the information to fight his ban, witch he won. I would would like to try that also. But i am awful with writing a solid formal letter. Plus i have a couple of questions with i would like to get some advice on.

the following information i need to know is:

\- Payment history to of my account- General account information(IMPORTANT)- All notes of my playing account(with out this i cant make a case)- All notes of my Forum account(not so much important but handy to have)

So i found this site( [https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-of-access/](https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-of-access/) ) they have a template witch looks good to sent to the said company.  So i would like to start form here and personalise my letter to my liking. I want to make a bit more aggressive. That is they dont comply with xx amount of time a complaint wil be filed [ICO.ORG.UK](https://ICO.ORG.UK).

\-Does the brexit effect the site [ICO.ORG.UK](https://ICO.ORG.UK)? or should i use a other website? if so witch one is better to use?- Is saying i wil fill in a complaint to the ICO not to aggressive?  or is it not enough and should i say it can included a fine)?

On the ICO website is says that said company can ask for a fee. How much is the fee in generaal? And can i refuse to pay duo that the information should be free for me?

I know i am asking a lot. And i think i left some bits and pieces out. I wil try my best to answer any questions you guys might have. i am at my wits end and i think this is my only way to get my account unbanned.

So I've officially received an updated survey of the property I **WAS** planning on buying and currently out of the option period. It is located in Cypress, Texas and both HCAD and the sellers agent have the property listed at 48k sqft. The new survey shows it to be **29,503** feet.

I based my decision to purchase the property largely on the fact it was advertised at over an acre and now it is 39% less than advertised which affects me in more ways than one.

As this is my first home I wanted to do my due diligence and currently have about $5k wrapped up in it between all the inspections/surveys/appraisals. Additionally I will be using a VA loan and it required additional inspections.

The layout of the property makes it difficult to gauge the size and while it looks like a acre, feels like an acre, on paper it is most definitely not.

My questions are this,

If it somehow appraises at the decreased lot size how do I go about renegotiating the price.

If the appraisal comes in low (which it most likely will) and they do not budge, can I get **ALL** of my invested monies back based on the misrepresentation of the property?

What are your thoughts on this situation? The seller/agent (investment team) have been very deceitful throughout the entire transaction by simply refusing to answer simple questions and not providing accurate information.

&amp;#x200B;

I have zero income. He controls all finances. I only have my credit card. That he puts a limit on every month. I don't have a way to store up any cash.

Our house will be paid off in 7 years. I have no idea what any of our finances are or where any of the accounts are.

2 cars both paid off.

He is the worlds biggest narcissist. Bordering on verbally abusing. His siblings are also both narcissist, and manipulate and verbally abuse their spouses.

I want out. I deserve better. My kids deserve better. I don't know where to begin in leaving.  I hate even being in the same room as him. He is always yelling, scolding, and berating me.

I did threaten to leave once in an argument and he told me he was going to take the kids away. Some facts regarding his parenting. He has never, and I mean NEVER taken care of both kids for longer than a 6 hour period. And that was when they were newborn.

In fact, he has never once left the house with both kids. 100% of all the kids daily needs fall on me. Of course I do it, they are my kids! Our child with the special needs is terribly attached to me. I don't mind this and I have him in many therapies for his disabilities.  Being on from sun up to sundown with 2 kids, well, it would be easier if I was on my own. I have to clean up after him non stop, cook, etc.

The sex. I hate it. It is absolutely awful. We come from 2 different nationalities. I am white. He is not. I think he was extremely inexperienced.  He refuses to perform oral sex. And quite honestly, I know how awful it would be and just leave me even more frustrated that he would never know how to do it correctly anyways. Yes, I have not received oral sex in 15 years.

I knew when I married him I would never receive oral sex again. And at the time it felt like an ok trade off because I was so in love, he was such a good provider, we had the same long term goals. I feel like I can't complain about never receiving because I knew when I married him.

This is in California btw.

In this case,  it was established that the custodial parent of the child would be making medical decisions for the child.   To put this whole situation in context, the non-custodial parent and custodial parent are not on good terms in situations where the non-custodial parent has called the police on the custodial parent before (that's a whole other bag of beans I wont get into). The non-custodial parent took their child of &lt;1 years old to the dental office (which is owned by the non-custodial parent's MIL) without the consent of the custodial parent.  The non-custodial parent then returned the child to the custodial parent later that day without informing the custodial parent of the dental visit.  Afterwards the child slept for over 4-5 hours through grocery shopping, car rides and being at home which was uncharacteristic for this child.

The next day, the non-custodial parent informed the custodial parent of the visit to the dental office and gave a bill of the dental visit to the custodial parent to pay for it.  The bill included charges such as ""oral hygiene instructions"", ""prophylaxis dental - child"" and ""motivational interviewing"".  No information or details in regards to the dental visit was given to the custodial parent from the non-custodial parent.  These charges also seems kind of fishy for a dental visit to the non-custodial parent's MIL for a child that is &lt;1 year old, especially a dental prophylaxis.

So questions:

1. In the case of a non-emergency, can a non-custodial parent make medical decisions for their child without consent of the custodial parent?
2. In terms of legal issues, did the dental office and/or the non-custodial parent violate any sort of laws in regards to providing medical care in a non emergency? I would argue that this is a non-emergency situation as the non-custodial parent did not bother to inform the custodial parent about the visit until the next day or any need for the visit at all thus far.
3. Could this be considered malpractice by the dentist based the nature of the items billed in the setting of a pediatric patient of &lt;1 year old being taken to a dentist?  I do understand that each clinician has their own clinical judgement and right to act on their judgement, but could a potential conflict of interest (being that the dentist was the MIL of the non-custodial parent) throw ""clinical judgement"" out the window?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href=""/r/legaladvice""&gt;r/legaladvice&lt;/a&gt;, got a dilemma here.

They began paying out less commissions due, but offering 6 goals that if met, would give you chances to earn certain percentages of your commissions due back.

They have not given us the drawing slips for 3 months now. Which means for 3 months we have not had the chance to earn that ""bonus"" percentage back. 

They also since January, started these quizzes that if you pass them, you get a bonus every month for being certified on that level. Since January, I have been told I couldn't take the level 1 quiz because the regional manager responsible for giving them doesn't have time to test people.  
Today, we had nothing but time and she was in the store so I asked if we could do it. 
She then informs me that there has never been a quiz. That she never wrote one up, therefore she doesn't have one to give me today.

I feel like I am owed the .25% of the commissions being held against this incentive, as it is in no way my fault that I do not have that certification.

In Ontario, the seller must advertise the cost of the HW contract in the house listing, as the purchaser is obligated to assume it. I agreed to assume the contract under the condition that is was ""in good working order."" 

&amp;#x200B;

After discussing with Enercare, I was made aware that the previous tenants were advised the unit must be replaced in 2017. Additionally, the unit stopped working after I signed, after the house passed inspection, which was a condition of my purchase, and before closing. Enercare again advised to replace the unit, but the owners elected to use a ""band-aid fix"" (language of Enercare). I have a written statement from Enercare on the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

My lawyer issued a letter indicating we understood that the vendors refused to replace the hot water tank knowing that if replaced the monthly rental would increase significantly and affect the sale price of the property.

&amp;#x200B;

They came back rejecting our claim of their liability, but offering $310 to settle.

Enercare again advised to replace the unit, but the owners elected to use a &amp;quot;band-aid fix&amp;quot; (language of Enercare). I have a written statement from Enercare on the above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lawyer issued a letter indicating we understood that the vendors refused to replace the hot water tank knowing that if replaced the monthly rental would increase significantly and affect the sale price of the property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They came back rejecting our claim of their liability, but offering $310 to settle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have since installed a new unit for $5400 (outright purchase). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should my next step be? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_________________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Summary timeline: **&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- November 2017 Enercare advised previous owners the hot water boiler needs to be replaced &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- December 5th 2019: House inspected, the inspector finds boiler operational and in &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; condition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- January 11: hot water fails, previous owner&amp;#39;s call Enercare for servicing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- January 17: Enercare advises owner&amp;#39;s of need of replacement &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- January 28: Prevous owner&amp;#39;s provides hot water contract to me (after I requested a copy, doing my due diligence)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-  February 1: deal closes, I move in. Boiler unable to provide consistent hot water during extended use (5+ mins)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- April 2: boiler completely fails, I call Enercare. Initially advised repair would be possible, over weeks of coordination, it&amp;#39;s determined the unit cannot be repaired. New unit quoted at $8,400 or $127/mo; significant increase over $49/mo rate advertised in MLS listing&lt;/p&gt;

Hi so I made an account just to ask this. And would much appreciate any insight.

So I used to be Friends with 2 guys who decided to house share together let's call friend A hank and friend B Chris. Hank is one of my close friends and I know he struggles mentally with health issues and I have been worried for him in the past. Chris I thought of as a friend but I have revised that opinion.

So hank moves in with Chris and they decide to go into shared accommodation and I'm pretty sure they have a joint tenancy. Hank later gets into a fight with Chris over some dirty sh** that Chris pulled. Hank decides to move out and hands in notice that he won't be living there anymore and Chris decides that he can't afford to live there anymore so tells hank he will move out.

Very recently I met hank looking like he has lost hope and he tells me that Chris is refusing to acknowledge that he is moving out and so the landlord is still charging hank for living there and so hank is having to work overtime for a house he isn't even living in and Chris is living happily with hank having to foot the bill.

I'm very worried for hank's mental health and I fear that he might eventually end up doing what people do when they give up hope completely.

Sorry this is so long winded guys but my question is if my friend hank did one day do that as a result of what Chris did can i get Chris in legal trouble for it? Is there a case against him? I feel like he would have contributed massively to the decline in hank's mental health and so is responsible. Obviously I will do everything I can to make sure hank never does such a thing but if it were to happen I want to know what I should be doing.

Due to the process involved we (my brothers and I) no longer have any communication with the executor and have had a very hard time obtaining any information at all regarding my mother's estate. The estate has been essentially closed (probate cleared, house sold give or take exactly 2 years ago). The executor withheld 50,000 for the final income tax return which I understand is common practise, however it has been a very long time since we have heard anything about how much, if any, was owed and more specifically, when we can expect the withheld funds to be distributed (all inheritance was distributed soon after the sale of the house).

I apologize for the excessive back story, my question is : 

How long does the final tax return take to come back from the CRA (I live in Ontario, Canada) and how long until the withheld funds are distributed to the beneficiaries? I have called every few months to inquire for the past year and a half since, I believe, the final return was filed but only receive very vague time frames (""about 4-16 months"") or no real answer at all.

It's been a really difficult time for me and my brothers and being completely in the dark doesn't help with coping and closure. It's been hard to ask these types of questions to any one involved without seeming like we are just impatiently waiting for ""our money"", when the real issue is that we don't trust the executor or her law firm and just want a little bit of certainty.

Again, I apologize for the lengthy post. Any expertise, advice and/or personal experience would be so greatly appreciated. I hope I explained my situation clearly enough.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother passed away in May of 2017 and my Aunt (her sister) was named the executor. Due to the process involved we (my brothers and I) no longer have any communication with the executor and have had a very hard time obtaining any information at all regarding my mother&amp;#39;s estate. The estate has been essentially closed (probate cleared, house sold give or take exactly 2 years ago). The executor withheld 50,000 for the final income tax return which I understand is common practise, however it has been a very long time since we have heard anything about how much, if any, was owed and more specifically, when we can expect the withheld funds to be distributed (all inheritance was distributed soon after the sale of the house).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the excessive back story, my question is : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long does the final tax return take to come back from the CRA (I live in Ontario, Canada) and how long until the withheld funds are distributed to the beneficiaries? I have called every few months to inquire for the past year and a half since, I believe, the final return was filed but only receive very vague time frames (&amp;quot;about 4-16 months&amp;quot;) or no real answer at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a really difficult time for me and my brothers and being completely in the dark doesn&amp;#39;t help with coping and closure. It&amp;#39;s been hard to ask these types of questions to any one involved without seeming like we are just impatiently waiting for &amp;quot;our money&amp;quot;, when the real issue is that we don&amp;#39;t trust the executor or her law firm and just want a little bit of certainty. Hence my turning to the reddit community.&lt;/p&gt;

I'll go into a small bit of background because I feel like it's needed to understand the story.

Me(31m) and 23f started out good then it went real bad real fast.

So from the beginning, I met this girl and we were a thing for about a month.

We moved into together which was really dumb on my part...idk, maybe I was booty blinded.

So we've been fighting for the past couple of weeks it's not been a good relationship at all.

Last night I told her how I felt and that we were done, she didn't take it well...she started with the usual 'Oh you think I wanted your ugly ass' 'your dick is small' all the regular insults that come out when you're arguing and a relationship is done, you know...trying to hurt the other person somehow.

I told her I was sick of the way she treats me and her forgetfulness because she constantly loses things (debit card, mailbox key, leaves front door unlocked) and just doesn't seem to care about anything really, especially cleaning up after herself.

So last night I came home and she wasn't at the apartment, she called and said she was drunk and that a guy friend was driving her home.

Spidey senses kicked in and told me to walk out so I wasn't trapped inside for a proverbial beat down. I walked around the complex phone in hand recording myself just in case something happened. I'm so glad that I did.

I came close back to the apartment and she was out on the street. She came close to me and I started to walk away, she kept following me. I told her to stay away from me I don't want her anymore. She got upset and began to chase me and swung her arms at me scratching my shoulder and ripping a hole in my t shirt.

I was able to get away, and she went inside the apartment and began smashing my tv. I miss that tv :-(

Anyways so her friend tried to approach me and I told him to stay away as well and they threatened to get people to 'really' assault me, they finally left after the altercation and I called 911. The police came and I gave them a written statement and showed them my video evidence. I guess she sidnt really think I would call them, I hope she learns a valuable lesson.

They told me to go back inside and if she comes back home to call them and they will arrest her...I was scared to go to sleep. So I stayed up all night, I'm actually really tired right now lol. She came back to the apartment about 8 o' clock this morning and I locked myself in the bathroom before she could get to me. I called 911 again, they sent out multiple cops and they arrested her.

It's July 4th now and the courthouse is not open for me to file an injunction. I plan on doing so tomorrow.

I just want to know what I can do from this point forward to protect myself legally. I have saved the video on a cloud storage and my phone so that it can be reviewed later on.

She also kept saying that she knows I have a restraining order on me from a 2013 non violent injunction. She said she would try and use that against me somehow but I don't see how. I did absolutely nothing wrong, and she was the one to attack me. If she wants to know how someone gets a restraining order she is about to find out, and I'm not sorry.

We are both on this apartment lease, I am afraid of this woman and I do not have another place to go so this is my apartment that I pay bills for.

She also has a prior simple assault from last year in North Carolina. I have no prior convictions except the injunction.

What do now? I mean I already plan on filing an order on her, but the police said she could be released as early as tomorrow night and I don't want her in the apartment anymore. Should I explain to the complex the situation and ask that she be removed from the lease? What happens if she tries to exact revenge upon me, I know that she is very angry but she kind of made her own bed on this one. I will never just take being a victim of domestic violence, I do not fight people and I don't want to be harmed either.

So many things are rushing through my head and I just want to do the right thing, she could have been civil and not assaulted me and break my property, but she made a bad decision and now she has to live with it. At this point I do not care about what happens to her in the legal sense, I don't wish her any harm I just want her to stay away from me.

Any advice on what to do next is very much appreciated and if you read this far thank you, I understand this is not literal legal advice but maybe someone knows exactly what steps I need to take to protect myself.

&lt;p&gt;Last night I told her how I felt and that we were done, she didn&amp;#39;t take it well...she started with the usual &amp;#39;Oh you think I wanted your ugly ass&amp;#39; &amp;#39;your dick is small&amp;#39; all the regular insults that come out when you&amp;#39;re arguing and a relationship is done, you know...trying to hurt the other person somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her I was sick of the way she treats me and her forgetfulness because she constantly loses things (debit card, mailbox key, leaves front door unlocked) and just doesn&amp;#39;t seem to care about anything really, especially cleaning up after herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last night I came home and she wasn&amp;#39;t at the apartment, she called and said she was drunk and that a guy friend was driving her home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spidey senses kicked in and told me to walk out so I wasn&amp;#39;t trapped inside for a proverbial beat down. I walked around the complex phone in hand recording myself just in case something happened. I&amp;#39;m so glad that I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came close back to the apartment and she was out on the street. She came close to me and I started to walk away, she kept following me. I told her to stay away from me I don&amp;#39;t want her anymore. She got upset and began to chase me and swung her arms at me scratching my shoulder and ripping a hole in my t shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to get away, and she went inside the apartment and began smashing my tv. I miss that tv :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways so her friend tried to approach me and I told him to stay away as well and they threatened to get people to &amp;#39;really&amp;#39; assault me, they finally left after the altercation and I called 911. The police came and I gave them a written statement and showed them my video evidence. I guess she sidnt really think I would call them, I hope she learns a valuable lesson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They told me to go back inside and if she comes back home to call them and they will arrest her...I was scared to go to sleep. So I stayed up all night, I&amp;#39;m actually really tired right now lol. She came back to the apartment about 8 o&amp;#39; clock this morning and I locked myself in the bathroom before she could get to me. I called 911 again, they sent out multiple cops and they arrested her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s July 4th now and the courthouse is not open for me to file an injunction. I plan on doing so tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to know what I can do from this point forward to protect myself legally. I have saved the video on a cloud storage and my phone so that it can be reviewed later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also kept saying that she knows I have a restraining order on me from a 2013 non violent injunction. She said she would try and use that against me somehow but I don&amp;#39;t see how. I did absolutely nothing wrong, and she was the one to attack me. If she wants to know how someone gets a restraining order she is about to find out, and I&amp;#39;m not sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are both on this apartment lease, I am afraid of this woman and I do not have another place to go so this is my apartment that I pay bills for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also has a prior simple assault from last year in North Carolina. I have no prior convictions except the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do now? I mean I already plan on filing an order on her, but the police said she could be released as early as tomorrow night and I don&amp;#39;t want her in the apartment anymore. Should I explain to the complex the situation and ask that she be removed from the lease? What happens if she tries to exact revenge upon me, I know that she is very angry but she kind of made her own bed on this one. I will never just take being a victim of domestic violence, I do not fight people and I don&amp;#39;t want to be harmed either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many things are rushing through my head and I just want to do the right thing, she could have been civil and not assaulted me and break my property, but she made a bad decision and now she has to live with it. At this point I do not care about what happens to her in the legal sense, I don&amp;#39;t wish her any harm I just want her to stay away from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice on what to do next is very much appreciated and if you read this far thank you, I understand this is not literal legal advice but maybe someone knows exactly what steps I need to take to protect myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL&amp;amp;DR:
Ex girlfriend assaulted me and is in jail right now, would like to know my legal recourse moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

My apologies for an unexciting post, but my friend and I are working for the first time with a lawyer on a injury case with a contingency fee agreement, and as this is all new and kind of intimidating to us, it'd mean a lot to have anyone take a quick look at some of the text in the agreement to see if there's anything unusual or questionable in it...

I've pasted in what seems like the most relevant parts below, and would be deeply grateful for any input! This is for a case being handled in Los Angeles, California.

\------

**Services** **to** **be** **Performed** **by** **Attorney**\*\*:\*\* Attorney agrees to perform the following legal services with respect to  the Claim(s) described above: (1) investigation of Claim{s}; (2) legal analysis and determining responsible parties; and (3) settlement  demands,  procedures,  and negotiations. If  Attorney  determines it  is appropriate,Attorney also agrees to perform the following legalservices: (4} prosecution of Claim(s} by arbitration or legal action until settlement, award or judgment  is obtained; and (5) if judgment is obtained in Client's favor, opposing an opposing  party's motion  for  new trial (if any). Attorney is authorized to  associate or employ, at Attorney's expense (at no additional expense to Client}, other counsel to assist in performing the services required by this Agreement.

**Contingency** **Fee** **to** **Attorney**\*\*:\*\*Client acknowledges he/she has been advised by Attorney and is aware that any contingency fee arrangements are not set by law and that a contingency fee between Attorney and which initial costs are borne by Attorney at his ***risk,*** ***time,*** and ***expense,*** and therefore, Attorney not Client, has sole discretion to  pursue Client's Claim(s} in  any manner he deems appropriate. (For example, Client has no authority to demand Attorney argue a motion against Attorney's advice, draft letters,or perform other legal work at Client's behest.) Bearing in mind that  the contingency fee is negotiable, Client agrees to  pay Attorney  a contingency fee as a share of any recovery, as follows:

**30%** OF AllFUNDS RECOVERED BEFORE A LAWSUIT IS FILED.

**35%** OF ALL FUNDS RECOVERED  AFTER  A  LAWSUIT  IS FILED BUT BEFORE  THE FINAL STATUS CONFERENCE, PRETRIAL OR TRIAL SETTING CONFERENCE.

**40%**  THEREAFTER, UP TO AND INCLUDING JUDGMENT.

Client agrees the arrangement above is fair and reasonable. In the event that Client is a minor at the time the Recovery is obtained, or if the case is one where attorney's fees are limited or otherwise established by Law, the fee shall be the maximum portion of the recovery that the law or a Court allows. Client consents to Attorney requesting a fee in accordance with the above schedule.

(a) **Costs** **and** **Expenses** **as** **Affecting** **Contingency** **Fee:** Client agrees to pay a **$250** Administrative Flat Cost out of any settlement, which includes ordinary copying costs, telephone charges and postage fees. Client also agrees to pay all costs and disbursements incurred by Attorney as reasonably required for investigation and prosecution of Client's Claim. This includes, without limitation, process service fees, charges for depositions and court reporters, investigators and special copying of documents, jury fees, fees for translators or interpreters, fees for expert witnesses and consultants, lay witness fees, messenger and delivery service, air freight, computerized research, videotape  recording,  travel  (including  mileage,  parking,  airfare,  lodging,  meals  and  ground transportation}, long  distance telephone, word  processing, court  costs, filing  fees, and other  miscellaneous expenses associated with the pursuit of your Claims. Costs and expenses paid in connection with Client's Claim shall be reimbursed before the contingency fee is computed. Client's share of the recovery shall be the balance remaining after reimbursement of such costs and expenses and payment of the contingency fee.

(b) **Sanctions** **Awards** **Not** **Part** **of** **Recovery**\*\*:\*\*Monetary sanctions awarded to Attorney during the course of any litigation  shall not be considered part of Client's recovery in this action. Such sanctions shall be deemed compensation to counsel for extraordinary time and effort expended as a result of an opposing party's bad faith conduct or failure to comply with discovery demands, court orders or similar obligations. But if the sanctions award includes a cost item (such as the filing fee for making a motion}. the amount thereof shall be credited to Client's costs account.

(c) **Fee** **Award** **By** **Court** **Not** **a** **Limit** **on** **Contingency** **Fee:** Any fee awarded by the court, pursuant to statute or contract, in connection with the subject matter of this representation, shall be paid to Attorney and shall be applied against Client's fee obligation  under this Agreement, but  shall not  limit  or discharge Client's fee obligation.

**7.**  **Litigation** **Costs** **and** **Expenses:** Attorney is authorized to incur reasonable costs and expenses in performing legal services under this Agreement. Client agrees to pay for such costs and expenses in addition  to the contingency fee discussed above.

**8.**  **Client's** **Responsibility** **Regarding** **Costs** **and** **Medical** **Liens**\*\*:\*\* Attorney may advance such costs and expenses on Client's behalf but is not obligated to do so.Client agrees to reimburse Attorney upon demand for any such advances. Client is responsible for such reimbursement regardless of the status or outcome of the litigation, or the amount of any recovery. Further Client is also responsible for all outstanding **medical** **liens** for treatment Client received related to Client's Claim(s} notwithstanding any outcome.

**10.**  **Power** **of**  **Attorney** **to**  **Settle**\*\*:\*\* Client hereby gives Attorney  a Special Power of  Attorney  to endorse and sign Client's name to any document, contract, release, or check relating to the case for which this Agreement is given, provided that Client has failed to communicate with Attorney or respond to communications sent to Client's last known address for a period of at least thirty {90) days. This shall be used to expedite Client's case when Client is not readily available, and Attorney  is further  authorized to  deposit Client's share of  any monetary recovery in Attorney's Client Trust Account to be turned over to Client when available.

Since then she's been healing pretty well and has been doing physical therapy the last several months. During this entire time, she's been on workmans comp due to her injury happening at work.

Cue to a couple weeks ago, she finds out she's pregnant with our first child. Her OBGYN gave her a doctor's note stating she's not allowed to work around chemicals at all because many of them are dangerous. The only available position she can work in at this time would be front office. 

The issue is that since she's in physical therapy working on strength training and hasn't been released yet due to not being able to her normal job duties. However with her being pregnant, she'd be able to go back to work right away if they have an office position available (which is less than likely). She's now worried about telling work because while they can't fire her for being pregnant, they can let her go for not being able to accommodate her. 

She's been trying to contact several people all they all say it's a unique case and not sure what advice to give her. She's been trying to contact an employment lawyer for help and to know what to do moving forward but no one has gotten back to her as of yet.

&lt;p&gt;The issue is that since she&amp;#39;s in physical therapy working on strength training and hasn&amp;#39;t been released yet due to not being able to her normal job duties. However with her being pregnant, she&amp;#39;d be able to go back to work right away if they have an office position available (which is less than likely). She&amp;#39;s now worried about telling work because while they can&amp;#39;t fire her for being pregnant, they can let her go for not being able to accommodate her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s been trying to contact several people all they all say it&amp;#39;s a unique case and not sure what advice to give her. She&amp;#39;s been trying to contact an employment lawyer for help and to know what to do moving forward but no one has gotten back to her as of yet.
Any help on the subject would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

My friend recently moved into an apartment in Virginia and noticed a funny smell.  They initially didn’t think much of it. But his wife has asthma and started getting sick.  He is also sick now with sinus symptoms and they have gotten worse so they had to move out and go to hotel.

Someone has come to take the wall down and they saw what appears to be black mold but the person said he or she could not officially say that it’s mold. 

Apparently the landlord said that there was prior water damage which she initially said was treated by a licensed professional.   It turns out she verbally admitted that she didn’t use any professional to treat the mold. 

My friend is sick and wants to get out of the lease but he is afraid to be on the hook for the rest of the lease terms

Lease terms say he has to pay till the end of the term.  My research shows that the landlord has to make an effort to rent the place even if he breaks the lease on his own accord and that he would only be responsible for the amount covering the time the apartment unrented.

I found this to be the relevant law/ordinance.


https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title55/chapter13.2/section55-248.25/

Can my friend get out of the lease because of the mold causing it to be unlivable?  

Does he have to give the landlord time to fix it?  She is out of town for 4th of July at the moment.

Can he be reimbursed for the other costs of finding a motel or medical issues?

I live in Illinois and I have a question about a situation that I am currently going through.   


I was in a major car accident and needed surgery. I informed my employer about the accident at the scene. They got the ball rolling for me and began my Short Term Disability through the insurance that I purchased through my employer. Once I was out of the hospital I kept in contact with my employers HR department and kept updated on the progress of my healing with them. As time went on I was evident that I was going to need to file for Long Term Disability through my employers insurance.

I received a simple questionnaire, the LTD Packet, and then my employer needed a statement from my doctor on their companies letterhead stating the severity of my injury and the timetable in which I was allowed to come back to work. The HR department received my long term packet and questionnaire by way of fax, but for one reason or another the letter head did not arrive to them. It was all sent at the same time.

I called my doctor up again. They said it was odd and resent it twice. I informed my HR contact that it was sent a second time and to inform me when they received it. I waited 2 business days. I send another E-Mail to the HR department about if they received the letter and I heard the next day that they had not received it. I turned around and called my doctor to send a third fax. I then sent another E-Mail to HR stating it was on its way and to please contact me when they receive it. I waited 24 hours.

At that point she was out of the office and received an automated e-mail on June 18th stating: ""I am sorry, but I am out of the office for a few days. I will return Tues. June 25th.""

I waited for her to return thinking everything was ok. However, when she returned on the 25th of June she still had not received the fax containing the letter from my doctor. Rinse wash repeat I called my doctor again. At this point this was looking like a cruel joke, but the doctor sent it a 4th time. This time I ""Called"" the office of the HR case worker to speak to them directly.

When I called the representative answered the phone with the HR Case workers name and asked how she could help me. I began to explain the situation over the phone and asked if she received my fax from my doctor. The HR representative all of a sudden out or pure magic had a deep southern accent and that her name was Nancy and that the person I was calling was not in the office and she was just working her station while she was at lunch.

I gave her my phone number, and I waited for her to call me back. I did not get a reply. No phonecall, no e-mail.. nothing. So I waited 48 hours and tried again sending her another e-mail asking about the status of my file and if she had received the fax from my doctor. I received another e-mail from the HR representative that the letter was still not there.

At this point I tried to send it to my manager at the store I work in to try and get the letter to her since it has been sent 4 times already in the span of 2 weeks. We are now at the day of my doctors appointment on  June 28th, She let me know that she has received all of the paperwork for my insurance EXCEPT for the letter that was already sent 4 times from my doctor. She acknowledged that she knew I had an appointment this day and informed me that the papers I had filled out for my ""Return to Work Notice"" DID NOT count as anything and she still needed the letter from my doctor on their company letter head. That was already sent 5 times.

I said no problem, I will be there in person I can make sure that happens. I did, and when I was at my doctor i saw they complete the fax and verify it was sent. By now I have the feeling you know where this is going. I haven't heard anything in 24 hours so I E-Mailed them again. I was informed that they STILL did not have the letter from my doctor. I regret to inform you the tone of my e-mails began to change. They became sarcastic in nature. I informed her that it was extremely odd that they did not receive this fax. I told her my doctor has shown me the letter and I have seen it with my own two eyes. i know it existed and they even told me the process on how they wrote the letter, but I continued with the charade and had them send ANOTHER FAX.

Surely, they had to get it this time. The letter I got back from my HR representative stated: ""The LTD was submitted a week ago, but the Letter from my doctor."" That was now sent 6 times was never received. After I received this e-mail I called my doctor one last time. I kept her on the phone, and she was laughing at how many times this had to happen. She thought it was absurd just as I did. After she had sent the fax a 7th time if she could send me a photo on my phone. She said: ""She could not because it is a document that is not meant to be owned."" I said: ""Is there another way that I can have this document sent to my place of employment so I can guarantee it gets to my employer."" She was hesitant to send it, but seeing how many she had already faxed it she was concerned and wanted to help. She then sent the letter in an e-mail to me and I emailed it to my manager at work.

My next e-mail after all of that work was to say that I was terminated from employment because they received the letter too late. This is what the e-mail stated that I received from my HR Case Handler on Jul 1st 2019:

""I spoke with my HRVP and explained how some information for your leave has been received from your doctor, but no note has ever been received. At this point your employment will be terminated and when you are able to return to work you can work with your manager to be re-hired. If you have any questions please let me know.""

At this point my manager and Regional manager tried to find a way for me to keep my job and not be terminated. I received another E-Mail from the same case worked and it stated as follows:

""The note was received by fax today Jul 2nd 2019 and I had it revived by HR. Here is their determination. Your doctors note does not qualify her for an extension. Please let her know that she only qualifies for FLMA, and at this time she has exhausted her leave and therefore must be terminated. She may apply again when she is released to work without restrictions.""

I need help, thoughts &amp; opinions on this situation please. Thank you for reading all of this.

Unfortunately 4 days ago she got a call from a social security scamner and gave out her info. I found out this after work(after 5pm, fed offices closed) but I filed a report online, then found the nearest ss office and told her to go there Tuesday and talk with someone as soon as possible. She did and the lady gave her a # to call so her ss activity can be monitored. I came home after work, she had the number but hadnt called yet, ""I'll do it tomorrow "". 
On a side note her car is in the shop for some accident repairs. I came home yesterday after work and 1)she hadnt called because she lost the ss number, and 2) stated the car mechanic (not her insurance company) said the car was totalled(its drivable, but needs some body work, and I know if repairs are cost more than the vehicles worth, ect ect) and asked for her ss#.
I'm so frustrated at my mother as I told her initially that the SS fraud was extremely serious. At the same time, why didnt her insurance company call her to tell her that her car is totalled? Why would the mechanic, who then asks for her ss#?
Of course today is a holiday and feds are all closed as well as her insurance company. I want us to enjoy our day off. What should I do? I know she needs to call the SS office again and her insurance company Friday. I'm so stressed right now!
Any advice would be great!
Location PNW USA.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I work M-F and my mom is on her own during that time. Unfortunately 4 days ago she got a call from a social security scamner and gave out her info. I found out this after work(after 5pm, fed offices closed) but I filed a report online, then found the nearest ss office and told her to go there Tuesday and talk with someone as soon as possible. She did and the lady gave her a # to call so her ss activity can be monitored. I came home after work, she had the number but hadnt called yet, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll do it tomorrow &amp;quot;. 
On a side note her car is in the shop for some accident repairs. I came home yesterday after work and 1)she hadnt called because she lost the ss number, and 2) stated the car mechanic (not her insurance company) said the car was totalled(its drivable, but needs some body work, and I know if repairs are cost more than the vehicles worth, ect ect) and asked for her ss#.

We did not have the luxury of looking at apartments before arriving due to time and financial constraints. We simply chose the best apartment based on reviews and applied online. It is worth noting that ever location we called told us that if we apply and are accepted the security deposit would be forfeit if we decide not to rent after being accepted (the deposit must be given at the time of applying). 

To make a long story short we signed the lease and sent it back after being *verbally* told that we had 48 hours to get it notarized and sent back to the office. We then drove over 20 hours only to find that the apartment conditions were as follows:

Upon moving in, the carpet and floors were wet because they had just been cleaned. This caused us to not be able to move our belongings into the apartment. They were still wet at 12:30am (time of this email draft).

The tub/shower faucet was found to be broken the day we moved in. Normally checks and apartment cleaning (see above) should be taken care of in advance to moving in. Notice of our move-in was known well in advance (June 24). The maintenance gentleman (very nice dude) did not clean up after he finished repairing the tub. This was completed after we moved in.

In the master bedroom there is a giant hole in the wall near the ceiling, where I believe a vent should be sitting. The vents that are in the apartment are covered in dust and so is the surrounding ceiling. 

An entire half of the apartment sits at least 10 degrees hotter than the rest. The AC is only effective in the living room. This may be due to the vent issue mentioned above.

While moving in, we noticed a couple gentleman smoking marijuana right by the door to our building (2520). 

We found debris on the wood floors that had to be vacuumed up before we were able to lay out our air mattress in the dining room. The circuit tripped no more than 30 seconds after I started vacuuming.

The bathroom sink does not drain properly. It takes over 30 seconds for the sink to drain fully.

On our apartment entrance door, there is a noticeable gap between the molding and the door. It appears as if either the molding is ripped off or the door is not sitting flush with the frame. This is not visible on other apartment doors.

While [office lady] was giving us the ""tour"" of the apartment, the sliding door handle in the second bedroom snapped off.

The stairwell in our building is quite smelly and appears as if it hasn't been cleaned in quite some time.

There is a space in our hallway closet that just opens up to the inside of the wall where the tub sits. This may be necessary for maintenance, but it gives critters and insects a place to get in (so does the hole in the master bedroom).

In that same closet, there appears to be remnants of shaving equipment on the shelves and strange body hair.

Across from that very same closet, we found 3 finger nails sitting on the rug against the baseboard.

On the rug right next to the kitchen area, we found a small screw just laying there in the carpet. 

The trim all throughout the apartment is banged up, and there are paint splatters on the floor of the dining room. This could reasonably be considered natural wear and tear.

[Office lady] did not have us fill out the electric form to have the service set up for us. She also did not give us the handbook or the lead pamphlet (both listed as required reading prior to signing the lease).

We plan on finding another location to rent and won't stay here any longer than we have to, but are we at all entitled to getting any of our money back? We have paid security and a prorated first months rent.

A list:

My hard drive was no longer mounted and was loosely bumping about (this is terrible for hard drives as they are fragile, and likely resulted in damage). Two of the rails that mounted it into the hard drive chamber were missing, one was snapped in half, and the remaining one as stripped of the bumps along the side, which were still inside the screw holes in the hard drive. This means that ecen if the specific the plastic rails that mounted it are still being made, I cant even mount it again due to the bits of plastic still in it.

My processor fan had been torn off and out of its spot on my processor. Two of the four screws were stripped of their catches which keep it in place, broken and therefore unmountable. The tearing off from the processor likely damaged the card, and which case my computer won't even work.

My RAM stick was half mounted, and the mounted looked broken. If the RAM isn't properly mounted the computer won't get past bootup.

The motherboard was scratched in a couple places. This can permanently render it dysfunctional. The motherboard is also slightly askew

All of the parts have been tampered with and its clear that it was intentional, as it was listed a fragile and none of this could have been cause by bumps or a rough transit. What's more, the exterior is indented and undamaged.

I filed a claim over the phone and they will get back to me before Friday 3:30pm CST. I took lots of photos but could not send them via phone.

They started doing this because occasionally I would park vehicles along the roadway, temporarily, when i needed extra parking for guests.  They called the sheriff several times, who wont enforce any parking restrictions because it is a private road.  They say it is a civil issue.   So now they’ve acquired farm equipment, boat trailers, large power/telephone poles, and other random things...and have placed them immediately across from my property, making it impossible for me to use part of the private road that I (and all other association members) pay for and maintain.

Nobody in the neighborhood is happy about the stuff in the road, but the association has no teeth when it comes to enforcement.  Neighbors said (to other people when approached) that the only way they’ll move the equipment is if I never park along the road again.

A bigger problem is one amongst them is the local township treasurer, who is the local governing authority.  They proposed and tried to pass a parking ordinance last year, which upset many people in the association and was eventually struck down.  It was immediately after that when they started parking “junk” across from me, within the boundaries of the private road.

I’ve considered the following:
1.  Going to state police since sheriff wont get involved, but will state police do anything?
2.  Taking to civil court, any recommendations here?
3.  Acquiring a bunch of junk, park it in the road across from their property to limit their use of road-playing the same game, which I think it is childish.

Looking for any recommendations, please help!!!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year my neighbor started parking a bunch of random equipment on the road “right of way” to prevent (especially) me, and other property owners from using the roadway., which is 40’ wide, but only paved 14’.  They own the property on the opposite side of the road, however the property they own is not part of the association...does not pay into the maintenance of road, but they insist they have more rights to the road “right of way” than I do.  They also own separate property in the association several houses down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They started doing this because occasionally I would park vehicles along the roadway, temporarily, when i needed extra parking for guests.

Hello! I asked on r/askLEO, got some scolding but still feel like I don't know what to do. 

I am staying at my father's house in California for the summer (he is away out in the brush in AK, for weeks at a time, with no phone or connection to the outside world, yes he's totally that guy). 

With his permission, allowed an ex GF to stay for ""a visit"", she moved a bunch of bags in and now doesn't want to leave. 

She does not listen to reason. I politely asked her to get her things and leave and she does not want to, and because of that I suspect she is going to Instead try to claim residency at my father's house. As crazy as that sounds, it wouldn't actually be that crazy for her. She knows that you need 30 days to establish residency. She has currently been here for about 2 weeks.  (I'll check that). 

Yes, it is my fault for allowing her in in the first place, however now we are here. And I want to know what I can do to protect myself, from her claiming residency in My Father's House. 

I am a 6'7"" male so if I physically keep her out I will surely be arrested. And if the standard is that after they've lived there for 30 days, you need to go through the eviction process, then what is the process *before* 30 days? 

So, I feel helpless. Please, tell me what I'm supposed to do. I don't want this person in my house. Thank you very much.

&amp;#x200B;

I received a speeding ticket last August in 2018 for doing 75 in a 50. I am almost certain I was not speeding or going over the limit.

This time around, they provided me the disclosure on the day of (just a copy of the officers notes). His notes clearly stated that there was no audio or video, since he was using a LIDAR on the side of the road, and on a motorcycle.  My argument to the JP was that I am in belief that he tagged the wrong vehicle and pulled me over. He asked me if I want a trial or an adjournment, and suggested that I seek a paralegal if this is what I believe. However, I don't want to pay $350-$400, for a case that clearly has no evidence, but a LIDAR reading. Do I have a case, given that there is no audio, video, or any witnesses? Can I fight this on my own? Just before the JP asked if I wanted a trial, the prosecutor came back and re-asked me if I wanted a plea deal, which I turned down, since again I am almost certain I was not going over the limit. It ended with the JP adjourning the trial to give me time to think, for another 3 months, which will be the 3rd visit...Mind you this is my first speeding ticket received and have never been to trial. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

I live in Portland Oregon and have been renting a room in a privately owned home for over three years.

We had a new roommate move in several months ago and in the past few weeks they have basically made the house uninhabitable. After being on probation for a small harassment offense, they began drinking again, and told my roommate that it was chill for them to have one beer. However, since that beer, they have barely left their room except to get more alcohol - not even to use the bathroom. They have been aggressive towards all of us, have caused a leak of who knows what from their room into the dining room, pissed on the living room couch, vomited all over the living room, and their room is so full of alcohol and bodily fluids that it's caused the house to smell rancid and disgusting. As a result, two of us haven't been staying there and the third person is only their because they have no choice to be elsewhere. The offending roommate has supposedly given notice but the situation got so bad we have called a mental health care service because when we saw her last, she looked like she was dying (not eating, not drinking water, just alcohol) and had lost 20 lbs or so.

The main question I have is what is our recourse for getting our rent for this month back because of this situation? The landlords are aware and have sort of helped (gave her a lease Violation form) but have not made moves to clean the house up so we can Live there. They've gone so far as to think we'll be able to find new roommates somehow in the condition the house is in.

Location is Ohio. Sorry for the long post, hopefully all of this is relevant. If clarification is needed, please let me know and I will do my best.

I'm posting on behalf of my mother. Last year she came down with what was thought to be the flu at first, but ended up being something far worse. There was a total of about ~5 weeks between when she first alerted her workplace of her being sick to her actually being able mentally and physically able to function.

She notified her work and boss that she was going home early (she had sick leave/PTO) when she first came down with the ""flu."" Eventually it progressed, and after about 3-4 days she was in the hospital, completely sedated and hooked up to every machine possible. We e-mailed her boss with the full details of the situation at that time and got no response. A few days later we had e-mailed an update and again, got no response. We continued to update via e-mail until she was able to contact them herself, approximately 5 weeks after this whole “saga” started. Since then, she still hasn’t had any contact with the place despite repeated tries.

She was salary (this probably isn’t relevant but she was getting paid for 32hrs/week but she was working 45-50) and two of her pay days landed while she was in the hospital. We had tried to contact her boss to see if she was getting paid (or even had a job) and again – no response. She only got paid a partial check on that pay day. 

It turns out, she stopped getting paid the day she went home from work early sick. She wasn’t told this whenever she went home. She never received any sort of “formal notice” of her termination to this day and it’s been MONTHS.
 
Is the termination and the way they went about it lawful? If not what, if any, recourse do we have in this situation?

His parents took out a student loan for him. He did not take out any student loans for the engineering school in Michigan. He took out student loans for schooling at a Wisconsin technical school from 2006-2007 &amp; took out student loans for a technical school in Minnesota from 2014-2017.

In November/ December of 2018 his parents got 3 consecutive letters sent to there home in Wisconsin  from Treasury of Michigan. When we came to visit from Minnesota  for the holidays we were able to open the letters. 

The letters were from collection agency and Treasury of Michigan saying he owes almost $4,000 to the university he went to for only 1 year that he did not take any loans out for.

The account number was his social security number. The dates did not match up. It never showed up on any credit reports between then and when he was first notified almost 13 years later. He was never previously sued, his wages never garnished,his taxes never intercepted. He was never notified until 6 months ago about this. The Wisconsin technical school hounded him right after the grace period. He had his wages garnished until they were paid in full by about 2009. WI school used to be on his credit report until it fell off. MN he applied for forbearance after grace period for 3-6 months initially then applied for an extension through 2020 both were approved. In May of this year he applied for loan consolidation and a payment plan because multiple loans through Nelnet in forebarence were destroying credit.  

When he called MI he talked to at least a dozen people who said to call a diffrent number or talk to a diffrent person who  eventually said it was his debt but with how sketchy it was we just assumed it was a scam and ignored it.

Last Friday we went to get preapproved for a mortgage ( our landlord is selling her property, we were working on credit and saving for down payment) . He has had his credit pulled on 3 occasions prior( not ideal, but life happens) . Last September when we tried to get prequalified for a home but his credit wasnt good enough for an FHA. Last December when we switched banks and this May when we took out an autoloan for a new vehicle. NONE of the previous 3 credit reports showed that he had debt in MI or that he was delinquent on his MN Nelnet Student loans before consolidation.

This most recent credit report did. We thought it had to be an error. Filed a complaint with FTC and local police station. Applying for a 7 year fraud alert and disputing charges at each credit bureau. Contacted Nelnet about the sudden 120+ day delinqient 10+ student loan accounts and told he is in good standing, now writing a letter of good will. Contacting Financial Student Aid omnibuds as well. We noticed that previously on FSA it was just his MN technical school and prior to that the WI technical school never the MI school. Now MI is on the FSA prior/ delinquent loans section and showing details that were never previously there. 

This cannot be legal. The statute of limitations and  validity of the school debt from MI should not affect our credit score or show up in FSA when it wasnt there previously can it?  Nelnet for MN school is notorious for screw ups they dont allow access to messages once opened ( at least for us on  a Computer) and we are having a hard time getting info on the 2 forebarances because the consolidation took over. And because account is in good standing there is nothing to send to credit bureaus.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband went to an engineering school in Michigan in 2005-2006 after graduating from High School in Wisconsin in 2005.

NONE of the previous 3 credit reports showed that he had debt in MI or that he was delinquent on his MN Nelnet Student loans before consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This most recent credit report did. We thought it had to be an error. Filed a complaint with FTC and local police station. Applying for a 7 year fraud alert and disputing charges at each credit bureau. Contacted Nelnet about the sudden 120+ day delinqient 10+ student loan accounts and told he is in good standing, now writing a letter of good will. Contacting Financial Student Aid omnibuds as well. We noticed that previously on FSA it was just his MN technical school and prior to that the WI technical school never the MI school. Now MI is on the FSA prior/ delinquent loans section and showing details that were never previously there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cannot be legal. The statute of limitations and  validity of the school debt from MI should not affect our credit score or show up in FSA when it wasnt there previously can it?  Nelnet for MN school is notorious for screw ups they dont allow access to messages once opened ( at least for us on  a Computer) and we are having a hard time getting info on the 2 forebarances because the consolidation took over. And because account is in good standing there is nothing to send to credit bureaus.&lt;/p&gt;

This place was a disaster, they didn’t have enough employees nor did they care. There was just four of us for awhile and we would have 18 or more rooms on any given day, it was way too much on one person. This is just a little background information to let you guys know how much of a hell while it was. The head housekeeper never helped, all she did was sit around and give orders, never tried to help with all the rooms.

Now onto why I’m here, first of all our time clock (which was electronic) was always messing up mysteriously. The weird thing was it was just doing it to me and one other person, not everyone. We complained multiple times and was just ignored, finally one day we caught that it claimed we had no hours that day, we had been there all day. They of course blamed us and said they’d fix it, well they added what they thought we had worked. I know it wasn’t right and this kept happening. I know I was being screwed, I started taking pictures of how it would be so many hours one day and the next day 10 hours or more would disappear! I actually have photos of this and the dates. 

Also, we were supposed to get a raise after working there for 90 days, that finally came and of course no raise. I asked everyone about it with no answer. Finally I talked to the owner, he claimed since the hotel had a new owner now that I would have to wait from the date they took the place over, not the date I started which is ridiculous!

Finally, we got a few new girls in that didn’t want to work. They would just leave whenever they wanted or not come in but still had their jobs. Now this didn’t happen just once or twice but so many I cannot even count, they got into no trouble at all. Me and another housekeeper just had to do their work like it was no big deal. One day after me and the other girl finished our twelve or more rooms we had to do this other girls twelve rooms. No one else just us two, it was already five in the afternoon at this point.

I would even come in on my days off just to fill in, even after all this and doing the best I could there. I missed one day, just on. As I said they let everyone else do as they please but never did anything about it, they fired me though. After I busted my ass their and let them treat me like nothing and cheat me, they fired me. Before you ask no I had never done this before and did nothing else. Another thing We have this Facebook group at work with all of us in it. One day after a long day of work I accidentally took home a lanyard with one of the master keys to the hotel on it we use, it was a complete accident but I was actually threatened by the person the lanyard belonged to (knowing I would bring it back the next day. She and another girl told me they would come find me and “beat a bitch”. Yes, I did take screenshots of this. 

There is plenty more I could tell you guys but I’ve rambled enough. I’m sorry if it’s way too long. I just want to know if there’s anything I can do about the way I’ve been treated unfairly here. Also in case anyone is wondering this is a commercial hotel, not a locally owned one. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I just feel so wronged and don’t know what to do.

Yesterday, I was at work and she was at home when we both received a text saying they (texter did not identify themselves. I have since asked whose number it is and have not received a reply) were contacting the police because someone was smoking marijuana in our apartment and we would receive a notice of default. 

I immediately called back and spoke to the general manager. I said I was at work and didn’t know what was going on. She said someone was actively smoking in our apartment and they were contacting the police. This time she didn’t say we would receive a notice of default. She said our lease would be terminated. 

I left work right away. I was going to go straight home, but the leasing office is between work and home, so I went there instead. I went inside less than 20 minutes after I spoke to the general manager on the phone, but was told I “just missed her.” I said I needed to know what was going on. The other lady there told me they knew someone was actively smoking pot in our apartment and letting the halls fill with smoke. I asked how they knew it was coming from our unit and not someone else’s and she said because a manager was standing nearby and saw someone enter my apartment. When the person entering my apartment opened the door, the manager allegedly saw smoke “billow out.” Again, she said they were contacting the police and our lease would be terminated. 

I went home. No police ever showed up. If they had, they would have seen that no one had smoked in there. So the apartment manager threatened to contact the police 3 times and never actually called them. They also threatened to terminate our lease. Instead, the sent us a $500 fee for “allowing a tenant or guest to smoke in our unit.” They say we have 7 days to pay it or we’ll be evicted. They also sent a lease termination paper, but it has the same date on it that our lease is originally supposed to end. 

I emailed the general manager and said I find it suspicious that they’re accusing us of this literally right after we paid rent. I said they’re not being straightforward or professional. I also asked for whatever proof they have because I was at work. I didn’t add this part in the email, but for the record I 100% believe my sister didn’t smoke in our apartment. She just didn’t. I was home less than half an hour after receiving the texts and didn’t smell anything in the building, let alone my apartment. They’re literally just making things up. 

Do I have any options at this point? Should we just pay the fine? We don’t have the money. We definitely don’t have money for court or lawyers or anything. Our lease is up August 31st. I don’t know what to do. I feel like it’s really sketchy that they said different things on the phone than in the text. And that they didn’t call the police like they said they would. It’s like they know nothing would be found and they’re trying to make it difficult for us to document this.

Ok this is a bit of a long story but for context I have lived in my house for 2 years now, it is a 2 story house that is adjoined at the garage to a house to my right and then another duplex of the same design is perpendicular to the left of my house leading to a very wierd parking lot. I bought it 2 years ago from Tom, met with him after I made an offer on the house and as the parking was wonky my girlfriend and I asked about the parking, he let us know he still owned the other units and that we had 2 parking spots, one in front of my front door, the side of my car would face my front door and the front of the car faced my perpendicular neighbor, the second in front of the garage. All is well until 2 months ago. He evicted the last tenants and moved his niece in. Problems arose before she even moved in. The first time visiting her house she blocked our front door with her Jeep assuming the front of her house was entirely hers. I had to get out and talk to her about the parking situation, (at this time had no idea she was my HOAs neice) she moved over and let me park in front of my door. Flash forward to five minutes later. She's knocking on our door. I'm gonna call her karen. Karen is demanding I move my car and never park there again because my lights shine in her window when I pull up (for context the way the poorly designed road leads to these houses when anyone drives up their lights shine into everyone's windows, it's why we all have curtains.) I may have been an asshole here but I just said we got blinds to solve that and closed the door. After this Karen turned into a nightmare, she's a single mom with 2 teenage girls who are constantly in front of her house screaming waking up our baby as late as 2am.
She sets up a couple of lawn chairs in front of her door and drinks there with greasy randos while loudly talking ""I hope we're not being loud"" that kind of thing. Over her first month she came over 3 more times demanding that I don't park In front of my house and then began blocking my car with her car or a couple of friends large trucks. I decided I had enough so I started taking pictures of them blocking my car. Then Karen starts calling my gf a bitch every time she's alone outside. That's it. I go to tom and I decide I'm going to have a reasonable conversation with him about his tenant. I show tom the pictures of karen and her buddies blocking in my car and tell him that she's been drinking in front of her house, being a nuisance and being loud, calling my gf a bitch etc... At this point Tom asks which address so I walk him over (he lives just barely down the road) and point out the house. It got really awkward then as Tom says oh well she's my neice. I say back yea well she doesn't like us she keeps blocking my car in, we have a baby who could need us to leave our house at a moment's notice, you need to talk to her about this. Tom says oh well I've been meaning to draft a letter to you. You can't park there anymore because you are being disrespectful towards her by parking there. I ask how, and explain that we have 2 cars, the garage was broken when he sold us the house and still is so we need both parking spots. This leaves her and every other duplex rentee/owner with 3 parking spots not including their garages and us with one. He replies that we should get the garage fixed and says we will receive a letter soon. A week later we get a letter that he posted on everyone's door that states the following *****(my address singled out) only gets one parking spot every other property has 3 parking spots and then goes on to say it's because I was disrespecting my neighbors by shining my car lights in their windows. Its time for the big reveal. I work mornings and am off by 2-3 and my gf and I did not leave after 8 almost ever because we are dictated by the baby. I conceded and we have my gfs car elsewhere as it didn't run anyways and now only have 1 spot. Problems don't stop there however karen is still frequently calling my gf a bitch as she walks to check the mail or take out trash. Karen has also started bringing her dogs out and letting them bark for a few minutes in front of our front window and saying ""aww the dogs are barking that's too bad"" or sending her girls out with the dogs and shouting ""aww your making the dogs bark you might piss off the neighbors"".

Ok this is a bit of a long story but for context I have lived in my house for 2 years now, it is a 2 story house that is adjoined at the garage to a house to my right and then another duplex of the same design is perpendicular to the left of my house leading to a very wierd parking lot. I bought it 2 years ago from Tom, met with him after I made an offer on the house and as the parking was wonky my girlfriend and I asked about the parking, he let us know he still owned the other units and that we had 2 parking spots, one in front of my front door, the side of my car would face my front door and the front of the car faced my perpendicular neighbor, the second in front of the garage. All is well until 2 months ago. He evicted the last tenants and moved his niece in. Problems arose before she even moved in. The first time visiting her house she blocked our front door with her Jeep assuming the front of her house was entirely hers. I had to get out and talk to her about the parking situation, (at this time had no idea she was my HOAs neice) she moved over and let me park in front of my door. Flash forward to five minutes later. She&amp;#39;s knocking on our door. I&amp;#39;m gonna call her karen. Karen is demanding I move my car and never park there again because my lights shine in her window when I pull up (for context the way the poorly designed road leads to these houses when anyone drives up their lights shine into everyone&amp;#39;s windows, it&amp;#39;s why we all have curtains.) I may have been an asshole here but I just said we got blinds to solve that and closed the door. After this Karen turned into a nightmare, she&amp;#39;s a single mom with 2 teenage girls who are constantly in front of her house screaming waking up our baby as late as 2am.
She sets up a couple of lawn chairs in front of her door and drinks there with greasy randos while loudly talking &amp;quot;I hope we&amp;#39;re not being loud&amp;quot; that kind of thing. Over her first month she came over 3 more times demanding that I don&amp;#39;t park In front of my house and then began blocking my car with her car or a couple of friends large trucks. I decided I had enough so I started taking pictures of them blocking my car. Then Karen starts calling my gf a bitch every time she&amp;#39;s alone outside. That&amp;#39;s it. I go to tom and I decide I&amp;#39;m going to have a reasonable conversation with him about his tenant. I show tom the pictures of karen and her buddies blocking in my car and tell him that she&amp;#39;s been drinking in front of her house, being a nuisance and being loud, calling my gf a bitch etc... At this point Tom asks which address so I walk him over (he lives just barely down the road) and point out the house. It got really awkward then as Tom says oh well she&amp;#39;s my neice. I say back yea well she doesn&amp;#39;t like us she keeps blocking my car in, we have a baby who could need us to leave our house at a moment&amp;#39;s notice, you need to talk to her about this. Tom says oh well I&amp;#39;ve been meaning to draft a letter to you. You can&amp;#39;t park there anymore because you are being disrespectful towards her by parking there. I ask how, and explain that we have 2 cars, the garage was broken when he sold us the house and still is so we need both parking spots. This leaves her and every other duplex rentee/owner with 3 parking spots not including their garages and us with one.

I  owned a joint mortgage with my ex-fiance, as well as a second down  payment assistance mortgage with him, we were very young when we bought  the house and didn't have much money.

Separate from that, I also had a car loan.

I  filled out and submitted a form 108 (which I have copies of and I am  looking at right now) and checked off that both mortgages will be  retained by the co-debter and that I will retain the car and continue to  pay the car loan.

I  am looking to buy a house now that two years have passed and  I just  checked my credit reported and Transunion stated that my second down  payment assistance mortgage and car loan were filed in the bankruptcy.

Equifax  and Experian do not even acknowledge that I had the second down payment  assistance mortgage at all. It is not listed on my credit report at all  and they both state the car loan was included in the bankruptcy.

My  main mortgage with my ex IS listed on all three reports and was stated  that it was NOT included in the bankruptcy because it wasn't, the house  was not foreclosed. The bankruptcy didn't affect his credit at all. He does know and he continued to  pay both mortgages with no issues. His credit is excellent. He WAS NOT a  co-signer with me, where if I defaulted he was then responsible,  it  was a joint mortgage, we were both on the mortgage and equally  responsible for it. The only way I can be taken off is through a  refinance or if he sold the home (which he did, about a year ago) and that is the same with the second mortgage as well.

So how is it that my two mortgages and car loan were  all listed on the same form but only my mortgage was the only one  stated as not in the bankruptcy?

Also  while my second mortgage for the down payment assistance says that it  was released in the bankruptcy, IT WASN'T, my ex continued to pay that  and paid it off fully when he sold the house.

Also my car loan wasn't released in the bankruptcy either, no one came to get my car and it is now fully paid off.

How  do I fix all these issues?  Bankruptcy does not look good at all but I lost my income and it was what I had to do. This does not look good at all that the  second mortgage, down payment assistance loan was included and my car  loan was included when it wasn't at all! These are just the big ones  that I noticed.

Yet  the second one listed (the second mortgage) is only on my Transunion  report as filed for bankruptcy and not on the other two reports at all

My car loan (The third one) is listed on all three reports as filed for bankruptcy, but it was paid off and no one came to repossess my car

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a pretty seedy part of MA, but most of my neighbors are fine. They do a lot of things they shouldn't be doing, but I don't really mind as long as it doesn't interfere with my life. However, the neighbors in one house directly beside mine have no respect for anyone living on the street.

Their house burned down months ago because of a cigarette incident, yet the lady who owns the house comes by everyday with her kids and friends and makes the street all of their personal playgrounds. They leave trash *everywhere,* occasionally go into our yard, park in our parking spot (connected to our house and physically part of our property), have had their kids tear our bushes and trees, and called our family plenty of derogatory terms. They have even gotten to the point of encouraging their children to berate my father and follow him while name calling, telling him how ugly he is because he had oral cancer is is now permanently disfigured.

We only complained once or twice to them directly over their loud music (played from 12pm to 4am) and them shooting fireworks over our house, but have never called the police. Not once. I have tried calling the police just once in the past, but they never bothered to show up.

One day after a family outing which I brought a friend to, as we pulled into our parking lot (which was flooded with people and another car which all had to move), we must have hit a nerve. The second we left the car, two men who didn't even live on that street (friends of the homeowner) began to tell us that our camera was invading their privacy because it pointed into our parking lot and possibly onto the sidewalk, which is public space. It was completely within legal limits, and we tried to tell that to them. We were met with racial slurs and a threat that it would be in our best interest to take it down or ""someone might just tear it down because people don't like being watched."" I was so mad, but when I interrupted they got very defensive about how they specially didn't say they or anyone there was going to do that.

Sometime in the middle of last night they must have torn down our camera. Now, the thing is that our cameras aren't even hooked up, but we don't want to tell them that. They are only there for show to prevent theft. Before that, many of them switched from sitting on our side of the street to the to the other side, but were told to get off by our neighbors. We have tried to tell them to go away, but because we supposedly don't have the same authority, we are brushed off.

Every single day they are outside gambling over adderall, shouting at each other, and just being unpleasant and trashy altogether. And to reiterate, it is not everyone on the street, it is only the one house besides ours and the people they invite over.

Im a 23 yo french CS engineer and i have been working for my first company for over eight months in Paris

About a month ago i started a new mission where i would be sent to the client (a big french school group) to help them developping and managing various project. 


Long story short the mission didnt go too well
I fucked up my first week (first week of june ) for various reasons (arrogance to the hiearchy mostly), then i realised how bad i did and tried with the help of my manager to fix things up 

One week later (13th june) my manager called me to say he was happy of py progress and that things were going better according to the client

I didnt have any feedback about how good or bad i was doing since that date neither from my manager nor my client. 

But yersterday (3rd of july)  they asked me to come to the office to discuss my mission 

There they said to me that the client wanted to cut short the contract that it was extremely bad and rare and that sanctions had to be taken

The said they would not let me go in vacations (my first day of vacation was today, the 4th of july and consists of monitoring young boy scout in lourdes to help sick people, the group can't go without me, and a trip to japan i promised to my little sister 3 years ago). The company knew perfectly i couldnt not leave.

I panicked and then they say we could negotiate something else 

They said we could sign a two ways resignation agreement right now so i could have my days off and i would be laid off by my return.

They said that usually you have to have one or two meeting beforehand to be able to sign this but because how rushed the situation was i just had to put ""18 th of june"" on the resignation contract to attest that i had those

What i didnt notice is that would mean that my rétractation limit would be set to the 2nd of july so a day before the meeting 

Note, I have discussion logs with my manager that show that those interviews have most certainly not happenned. Like from my manager the 20th july ""yeah we need to see what kind of job they are going to give you (the client) in august""

Because of the emotion and my lack of experience i agreed on the spot.

I made some mistake so a good part of this is on me. 
If i didnt get fired before my vacatoons i would have been probably after. 

But i kinda wanna know how bad this kind of situation is. And if a justice fight would be worth it.

Im not in an union btw

My friend was visiting so we drove up to the mountain two hours away to go stargazing, about 1:30 am we are about an hour from home when I turn onto the highway. This dark car comes flying around the corner and starts tailgating me hardcore for a mile or two. I finally get irritated with not being able to see out of my mirrors and turn on the next road I see - police light flash on and pull me over. Great. Just great. 

I got a traffic citation because my car registration was expired. He told me the reason he pulled me over was because I pulled out in front of him (which was not the case), but he ticketed me for my 5-month expired registration.

Now I have never had a ticket in my life; I have never been pulled over or anything. I have no idea how any of this works, and he is telling me that it won't go on my record, etc, I just need to get it fixed. 

Now my registration really was expired to my surprise. I was moving apartments from an awful situation to a way better one. As in breaking my lease because of the building being unlivable. Somehow in all the mess of papers and getting everything covered for moving I forgot to go get it done. I had been driving around this entire time thinking that I was good and had gotten it done. So I am guilty, but first thing I did in the morning after was wake up and get it done. First person in the door after like 3 hours of sleep. 

I know me forgetting means abosukutly nothing to them, so I planned on just paying the ticket online and calling it a day. Except they have not turned it in

I am trying to avoid taking time off of work to go to three counties over just to pay a ticket and also lose out on work (which is going to cost more than the ticket) I cannot really afford to lose that much money in one go because the police officer didn't turn in my ticket.

What can I do? Do I need to bite the bullet and take off work? Will it really not affect my record? Will my insurance go up?  I've tried googling everything I can in the last three weeks but can't find anything useful outside of GA has some of the most expensive fines in the country.

Normally I am medicated, but for the last couple of months I have regrettably failed to maintain my mental health regimen. Without medication I suffer from both positive and negative symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, and dissociation, among a few others, but these are most relevant. For the past couple of weeks I've been dealing with the onset of another bout of psychosis, and failed to get the help that i needed in time to prevent my horrible misdeed.

Sometime between tuesday and wednesday, my boyfriend and I got into an argument, and at one point we were fighting over the possession of a phone. The scuffle is a blur to me, as well as the majority of the night. I remember feeling that he was trying to hurt me, that I was faultless, doing what I had to do, and he, in my mind, was evil, heinous, and constantly out to sabotage me and my life. After the fight we had words, which I dont quite remember, and he went to sleep. I remember fuming, and staring in the mirror for what I feel was a long time but that I remember only as a frame in my jumbled memory. i remember speaking words into the mirror, but I do not remember what they were. The next morning, when I woke up, I had a black eye and was consumed with the thought of being wronged. I remembered that he gave me the black eye during the fight, and felt that the only way to end his control over my life was to go to the police and report him. So I did. The story I gave was that I was sitting there, and he stole my phone, and then while i fought for it, he elbowed me in the face, and pushed me into a desk. They of course believed me, seeing my eye, and sent out a warrant for his arrest on charges of domestic violence. I left feeling like I had done what needed to be done.

And then some time passed. Certain things about my story started to feel wrong. I got home, and he was being very kind and regretful that we had fought, which is how he normally is. He asked what happened to my eye, and I told him that he'd done it, and that I'd gone to the police to report him. I remember his face, so sad and scared and confused. He told me that he had never elbowed me in the eye, not even on accident. Due to my mental illness, we have an agreement to record the audio during fights, so I know what's real and what isnt when my episode subsides. He played me the audio starting right after the phone incident, and I never once mention being elbowed. We fight sometimes, but theyre never like what i told the police. Theyre usually ridiculous in retrospect, never sinister, and if ever it gets out of hand, I'm the primary aggressor. He would never hurt me, and puts up with so much from me that it's almost saintlike.  The more I reminisce i worry that I gave myself a black eye during a period of dissociation, and then blamed him for it. I do not remember doing this, but I have seen videos of myself in the past banging my head on concrete and saying that it's his fault, incidents that i also do not ever remember. I called them once before my hospitalization and told them that he was trying to kill me, but there was no evidence, and nothing came of it because it wasn't true, and even my parents were there to say it wasnt true.

As soon as I began to regain insight, I went to the police and told them that I wanted to drop charges, but they said they could not, and Missouri is a ""no drop"" state in cases of domestic violence. I am terrified that what I did during a psychotic episode could ruin his life. there is a warrant out for his arrest, and if he gets arrested before either of us are able to prepare anything legally, then it's likely that the prosecutor will think that in claiming insanity, I'm trying to defend my abuser out of fear or something. I understand that defending an abuser is a common occurrence, and while a lot of times it is the case, in my case it just isnt. My story was inaccurate. I have a history of mental illness, and giving myself a black eye to criminalize my boyfriend because ""it's necessary"" totally seems like something i would do, even though I dont remember it.  

  My question then is what steps i should take in order to prove my boyfriends innocence before it's too late. Should I tell the police that the report was inaccurate with the help of an attorney, before my boyfriend is taken to jail? How could Missouri being a no-drop state stifle my progress? Also, I have hospital records, prescription lists, and probably even my parents as evidence. What other forms of evidence could help? My boyfriend is a wonderful person who would never hurt anyone or anything. If this ruins his life then I'll never be able to forgive myself.

This has been an ongoing, sticky situation and I need insight.

Very brief backstory: My father passed away last year. Due to his bipolar disorder, he was on disability for most of his life. He made pocket change by selling things on eBay. One time, my dad got sick and had to be hospitalized for quite some time. He lost his eBay account, so I gave him mine (still in my name). Looking back, I shouldn't have done this, but I was 16-years-old and just wanted to help my dad out. He had and used the account (in my name) for about 4 years.

Fast-forward to his death last March, my stepmom got what was left of his life insurance (I believe it was like $5K, there was very, very little after paying for funeral). I got 1K (which I put towards the Paypal balance) and my brother got 1K and she kept the rest. Or so this is what we were told... my entire family does not trust this woman.

I check this Paypal account after getting weird calls and turns out this account had a balance of $5.5K that hadn't been paid in months. I was furious and stressed. My dad died on March 28th and there was a final transaction on April 12th. I called PayPal and they said my stepmom withdrew the funds. I confronted her about it and she said she paid me back. It's been almost a year now and she completely cut contact with me and my family. I haven't spoken to her since Christmas. I've pay the bill because I don't have a choice and got the balance down top $3.9K but she owes me $1,600 since she withdrew that money.

What can I do? Should I get a lawyer? I have proof she withdrew the money but it's been a year now and I don't know what legal rights I have since some time has passed. I was naive and believed she would pay me back which is why I didn't take action earlier and I wanted to keep things between us civil.

So when I toured my Apartment, one of the first things I noticed was the sign had the entrance that warned the building was under 24 hour surveillance.

Fast forward to last night I had date I came home and was smoking a cigarette out back. Guy comes up to me starts making me nervous I try and go back inside. He forces his way into my building and shoved me to get in when I tried to shut the door behind me. I call 911 and let my property manager know what happened. Police showed up took a statement. After they left I texted my property manager and asked if the tapes got anything. She ignored my question.

I stayed at hotel last night because I was nervous. This morning I have looked around the entire common areas and exterior of the building. I can't find cameras anywhere either discreet or obvious. I think the signage is a complete bluff to deter criminals. I Just reread my lease and there's a section that says ""Neither Manager no landlord or any agent of Manager covenant nor warrants expressly or implicitly the security of person and/or property"" I took this to mean standard liability waiver and since another part of the lease required renter's insurance I figured my insurance would cover any claim for stolen property. But now I don't know what to think since I was lead to believe there were cameras.

So am I shit out of luck? I feel lied to and betrayed and I don't know what to do. I kinda of feeling nervous and unsafe.

I currently work for a security company located in British Columbia, Canada. For the sake of privacy I won’t say which, but we are contracted at a high end job site (think billions globally). I'm an employee of the security company. To job site I'm a contractor.  I’ve been working here for 2 years and in that time I noticed my boss and his boss (Hereby referred to as middle and big boss) have an extreme aversion to paying overtime for anything, to the point of being told if you need to take a day off for whatever reason, rather than pay another officer OT, you have to pay them out of pocket if overtime would have occurred. Meaning you stay on the schedule, get paid for the shift as if you worked it, then pay the other person their wage out of pocket. You paid the income taxes already, now have to pay whoever took your shift.  Even if you calculate out the taxes, you’re still theoretically paying taxes for a tax bracket you might not otherwise be in. I was told verbally, when I asked middle boss this week if big boss receives some sort of kick-back for keeping overtime low, that that was correct. 

I wouldn’t mind doing it as a favor to a coworker every now and again but when it’s coming from your employer it comes off as coercive. 

I started going back to school in the spring and after months of asking to have my hours reduced (to no avail since they let a guy take a month off for his wedding with little notice and we only have so many OFA2s.) so I could get ANY rest the only ‘solution’ middle boss had until vacation guy got back was that he would take one of my Saturday shifts per week if I paid him out for them. I had had 0 days off in 3 months, I had to agree for my own well-being. The workload was severely affecting my mental health, and in turn my job and school performance. 

As of May I informed them in writing I would no longer be available Saturday through Sunday as of mid June (the day vacation guy returned). I have to look after myself. 

That went well for about 2 weeks, now someone else is on vacation and I’m seeing Saturday shifts on the schedule. He claims it’s only to back-fill cause another guy is on vacation. As well as my mental health and general household maintenance, I need to leave availability open for possible practical experience in my field. 

I do have at least 1 email from him saying a shift would need to be paid out of pocket from his work email, plus 2 or 3 emails of him requesting payment for taking specific shift dates. One thought is to take this to the security company head office. I do worry this could backfire somehow if they are also complicit. I'm at my wit's end with this.

Obviously he's trying to get around reporting and paying taxes on it. **But is this something I could get in some serious legal trouble for?** Sounds like I'm being woefully complicit.

Kind of wondering if this is a serious red flag because:

A) That he would put in that sort of situation where I could get in trouble. Dick move, right? Wrong?

B) The way he handles his finances. I've always been by the book and I'm not a fan of him trying to cheat the system. He also owes taxes (the individual mandate fines).

traffic wasn’t as heavy despite being fourth of July. Google Maps approximated a 2hr 18min arrival time . I make this trip weekly.  
Avg rate of speed to make it within this time which i did has to be ~70mph 
I had no motive for speeding. I don’t celebrate 4th of July nor do i have family where i was going. I live by the “my destination isn’t going anywhere” quote 

Start: I was traveling with/at the speed of traffic which is stated to be legal within the CA drivers handbook.  The speed of traffic at the time  around 80~mph there were others around me traveling at my speed. Last i checked in this area i was barely hitting 80 mph! Again still traveling at the speed of traffic

Now approx 4 mi AFTER the zone of citation the I-5’s lanes go from 5 lanes to 3 lanes .(I-5 N Buena Park/ Santa Fe Swapmeet area) . 

Theres always a normal slowdown all throughout this 4 mi stretch as the freeway converges to 3 lanes. This time there was hardly a slowdown at all ! the flow of traffic was still consistent. 
I was flashed down id say about 2 miles into the 4 before the slowdown, but couldn’t pull over since there was no shoulders and had to do a drive of shame as i approached the closest exit after the start of the 3 lanes. 

I know i wasn’t going no 90 mph i was in total confusion when i was flashed down as again i was traveling at the speed of traffic. 

I’ve never gotten a single traffic ticket. 
I don’t wish to think about how much this will cost..

Well the insurance company is denying our claim. They said the car only had a dent even though they would never know the extent of the damage given they never sent anyone to investigate. In reality the entire back end on the right side is fucked, the trunk wont close right and one of the lights on the back had to be replaced. They said their client wasn't at fault despite everything pointing to the contrary and essentially told us a bunch of legal jargon that amounted to ""We can do whatever we want because you're probably poor and can't afford to sue us.""

I have no idea what to do. We can't afford to repair or replace this car. We were barely getting to and from work on it and now it's fucked. We have no other way to get around. A we wanted was for them to pay for repairs and they refuse to budge on anything. I don't know. Do I even have a case? Sorry for wasting time if I don't.

Update: So the guys insurance says that their client is not at fault because he told them my step-dad was at fault because he was  the one running the red light. (how you get hit from the back running a red light is beyond me) So we call up the guy himself. (he gave my step-dad his number) He says he told them no such thing and even admitted he was the one at fault. Best part we recorded everything. (one party consent state so no wiretapping charge) There is now proof that not only was the guy at fault but that either he or his insurance company is lying.

&lt;p&gt;Update: So the guys insurance says that their client is not at fault because he told them my step-dad was at fault because he was  the one running the red light. (how you get hit from the back running a red light is beyond me) So we call up the guy himself. (he gave my step-dad his number) He says he told them no such thing and even admitted he was the one at fault. Best part we recorded everything. (one party consent state so no wiretapping charge) There is now proof that not only was the guy at fault but that either he or his insurance company is lying. Will update further if anything else happens.&lt;/p&gt;

Our Vietnamese manager only hired Vietnamese people during his first few weeks. I had multiple friends of different race that applied as well but never received any contact, but I did not think too much of it. He then promotes these Vietnamese workers within the first 2 weeks of hiring them. We’ve had trainees that have been working there far longer than these new employees, yet they were refused to complete their tests to complete training. Finally, he was more lenient with the newly acquired workers. Their mistakes were often glossed over however our manager threatens us with write ups and terminations over the same mistakes. 

Finally, I decided to address that last issue in a group chat with everyone including our manager and his managers as well. I had reason to believe that one of these employees were risking the spread of foodborne illnesses. However, this was also glossed over by our manager as well. I’m not going to sit here and say my primary motivation was not to scare our manager in front of his superiors. 

However today, my first shift after this incident our manager terminated me for vaping in the bathroom. I’ve quit vaping a month ago, and his argument was that another employee saw me come out of the restroom and he said that I smelled like vape. We bomb the bathroom with febreeze every night so if there was any scent it would be the febreeze scent. Additionally, he’s previously given another Vietnamese employee 2 warnings over suspicions of vaping without termination.

When I came back home, I’ve found couple reasons to believe that this was a wrongful termination due to retaliation. Labor code 1102.5 states 

&gt;Protects against retaliation for disclosing information, or because an employer believes an employee has disclosed information, to another employee who has the authority to investigate, discover, or correct a violation where an employee reasonably believes that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation. Protects an employee who refuses to participate in an activity that would result in a violation of a state or federal statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal rule or regulation. Protects an employee who exercised his or her rights under Labor Code section 1102.5 in any former employment.

Additionally under EEOC’s retaliation page it protects 
&gt; communicating with a supervisor or manager about employment discrimination, including harassment

Finally since I was fired on my shift after I messaged my superiors, it would serve as a circumstantial evidence that my termination was as a result of these messages.

I triggered the alarm entering the home. I could not turn it off.

Police arrive and place me in the car. My old neighbor tries to explain I used to live there. Original charge felony burglary. I am placed in solitary for 60 days.

1) I am visually impaired. I have genetic retnia damage. I have severe eye and neck pain. I want to use marijuana. How can I do this? I had a medical card but WA got rid of the medical program.

They have been sending emails out giving updates regularly about what buildings will be worked on next and overall progress and requesting tenants to not park in front of the buildings in case their vehicles get damaged. Work was set to begin on my building this week.

There is about 15-20 parking spaces in a single row in front of my building with two spaces being handicapped spots in front of the ramp to get down to the building. There is regularly a car in each space so I know they are in use, but I am unsure if either of the tenants who use the spaces are wheelchair bound.

I came home from work yesterday to find a large dumpster taking up about 5 of the parking spaces in front of my building including the two handicapped spots and slightly obstructing the path to the ramp itself. There is enough room on either side of the dumpster for it to be able to be moved left or right and open up at least one of the handicapped spots. But it just genuinely seems like they just put it there without considering what spaces were being blocked.

The next closest parking spaces to the building are about another 20 feet away in either direction. So one of my handicapped neighbors might have to walk a bit further than normal to get to their home.

Is this temporary work in violation of the ADA or any other tenant/landlord laws or would that only be determined if one of my handicapped neighbors were to get hurt in relation to being unable to park in the closer spots?

The roof work has been moving at about the pace of one building/week but because of the holiday tomorrow, I doubt any work will be done so I am unsure how much longer the spots will be blocked.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all, I live in an apartment complex in Arlington, Texas and recently, the complex has been doing roofing repairs to all of the buildings. They have been sending emails out giving updates regularly about what buildings will be worked on next and overall progress and requesting tenants to not park in front of the buildings in case their vehicles get damaged. Work was set to begin on my building this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is about 15-20 parking spaces in a single row in front of my building with two spaces being handicapped spots in front of the ramp to get down to the building. There is regularly a car in each space so I know they are in use, but I am unsure if either of the tenants who use the spaces are wheelchair bound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came home from work yesterday to find a large dumpster taking up about 5 of the parking spaces in front of my building including the two handicapped spots and slightly obstructing the path to the ramp itself. There is enough room on either side of the dumpster for it to be able to be moved left or right and open up at least one of the handicapped spots. But it just genuinely seems like they just put it there without considering what spaces were being blocked.&lt;/p&gt;

I have tried everything to convince them to plan for their future: I have reasoned, begged, persuaded, implored, nagged, argued, etc. to no avail.

They have always been terrible at managing their own money. Both are heavily in debt, and they immediately blow every dollar they manage to get their hands on.

I am pretty much their retirement plan. I've always been the ""responsible"" child: working hard to earn, save, and multiply my money. Despite growing up in semi-poverty, I have worked my way into a high paying career and now enjoy a fairly comfortable financial situation. My younger sister, on the other hand, has always been the ""mooch"". I never give her money when she asks for it, so she goes to our parents whenever she needs money for stupid shit, even when they are broke. She's one of the reasons they are in debt.

I know that what I am about to say sounds extremely callous: **I don't want to financially support my parents when they retire**. I don't want to support my sister, either. 

I don't feel like I owe them anything. I didn't choose to be born. Ever since I got my first job at 16 I paid for my own shit except for food and shelter, until I moved out at 18 and started paying for everything, including my own university degree. I've always been independent and to this day I refuse their help even when they offer it. Everything I have, I earned through my own hard work (yes, I admit there was some luck that contributed as well).

In my view, if my parents end up penniless by the time they reach retirement age, they will have no one to blame but themselves. They rarely cook at home, always eat at restaurants, pay for everything with their credit card, and buy cars/a house/vacations they can't afford. Frankly, I don't even like my family because of the type people they are. All three are entitled, lazy, greedy, selfish, materialistic, wasteful, and stubborn.

Whenever I try to convince them to make better financial decisions they get extremely offended, saying that it's their money, they get to spend it how they want, etc. They say that I can't control them.

Today I got in a huge fight with them about it.

My mom wants to book a vacation, and I tell her not to because I know she can't afford it. She says ""it's my money, it's none of your business how I spend it"". I tell her that it absolutely is my business, because neither she nor my father have been saving for retirement, meaning that when they can no longer work, I'll be on the hook to take care of them. We argued, some insults were thrown around, until I bluntly told them that I refuse to support them in their old age as a consequence of their irresponsible spending habits. 

They were horrified to learn that and said I was being heartless. Finally, my father said there's some law saying that children are obligated to support their aging parents, and that if they ""end up on the streets because of [me]"" they will sue.

Is this actually true? On what basis could they pursue legal action? To what extent am I legally obligated to support my broke aging parents?

We are talking to a lawyer, but I wanted to get some opinions on here. Trying to provide as much information as possible, so please bear with me.

In 2016 I moved into a house with two roommates. At this time the house was being managed by Rental Company A. We paid $1300 in security deposits (split between the 3 of us), and I paid $400 in pet deposit. As roommates left and new ones came in, the security deposit was passed along. I am the only one who has stayed the entire duration of our lease. Every time we renewed the lease we were sent an addendum to our lease. The final time we renewed in 2018 it was mentioned in the renewal that the house needed a lot of repairs, so there would be no deposit required. We confirmed with the company that my initial deposit would still be refunded at the end of the lease.

The house itself was in pretty bad shape the entire time we lived there. It was a pretty old house. The AC would stop working every summer and they had to send someone every time to fix it. There was a pretty bad mice problem every year. But there was no damage caused by us during our (my) 3 year stay.

This year in January the owner decided to hand over the property management to Rental Company B. We had 5 more months on the lease, and the new company also acknowledged that they had taken over our deposit and would refund at the end of the lease, minus the cost for fixing regular wear and tear. We gave sufficient notice and moved out on May 31st. They already had someone in the house cleaning things up and painting the house on the day we were handing back the keys.

I followed up with the property manager on June 12th about the deposit, and she said she was working on processing it. Finally when I sent her an email the night of July 1st (technically already outside the 30 day limit for refund), she responded that they deducted our deposit from all the work they did on the house and we still owed a balance. When we asked for an itemized bill, it says we owe $3731! The invoice was billed to the owner, but the property manager said she is claiming the charges from us. Here are some of the charges:

Painted 8 doors interior/2 exterior: $358

Painted all walls: $1860

Replaced bathroom light fixture: $99

Front yard trees trimmed: $185

Haul away branches: $45

These all sound like things they would do anyway when people moved out. Do we have a case? We are talking to a lawyer and planning on getting them to send the property management company a letter. If advised by the lawyer we are also willing to take the owner to small claims court. Is there anything else we could do?

I worked for the company for two years as a district manager. I am a top performer and received an above target rating on my last performance review. 

I was asked to meet with my supervisor on Tuesday this week. When we started the meeting he said ""this doesn't seem to be working for us so I find it best that we part ways."" I was surprised. I will add for relevancy that we had recently had several conversations in which we disagreed about our approach to a particular problem but I worked within all company policies and I was not disrespectful in any way. 

I was asked to return my company car and other belongings by the end of the next day. My email was shut down by noon. They will not pay me any of my vacation or personal time. They are also withholding a $3,500 bonus that I earned in 2018 which they decided to split payment for this year. 

I was not asked to sign anything and nothing was provided in writing for the termination. Nothing at all was put in writing. 

My initial inclination was to move on (I have been looking for a new opportunity for a while). However, I asked if I would be provided any discharge paperwork and I was told I would not. I was further upset because a few of my direct reports were led to believe I had done something severe to justify the termination. 

What recourse of action do I have? I have read that I can request a service letter that forces the employer to provide information about my termination? 

I am also shocked they didn't provide in writing when my last day of pay would be- absent any written documentation, couldn't I argue that I understood I would be paid all outstanding vacation/personal time? Can I make a small claims case against the employer for this missing payment? 

Thanks in advance for any advice, I am happy to answer any additional questions.

The son became violent, kicking in doors and attacking the mom in his psychosis and still the police refused to take him in for an ER check- through three attacks on the family, even knowing that mental health professionals were waiting to evaluate the son. Finally the police did take him in (after being put on the phone with a mental health professional) after the son kicked in the front door.

The son spent 3 months in a lock-down mental health ward. Then he was released back into the community. A week later the family got a call from a mental health professional who was trying to deal with the son and he told the family that 'credible threats of violence' were made by the son toward the family. This professional also said he had alerted the police department of this. 

A few days later the son was spotted sitting in a family members vehicle in the driveway. The family called the police as the mental health professional had advised and the police briefly talked to the son, then came to the door and told the family that 'he seems ok to me'. This was the same officer who had refused to do so in the past.

The mom got the responding officer on the phone with the mental health professional who told the officer that despite what the son 'looks like to him' that he was in a dangerously volatile state, to please bring him immediately to the emergency room for intake.  This mental health professional also called the officer in charge at the police department to plead with them to get the son to the ER for intake. Despite this, the responding officer again refused to do so, saying that he 'didn't hear anyone threaten anyone' and then left. 

A week later, the family was able to send the mom to another state to live with her extended family for her safety, leaving the dad and two young adult sons in the home. 

About a week after that, the dad went to the local store for bread and milk one evening and the schizophrenic son was apparently outside and saw him coming. He ambushed him from some bushes and beat him with a large rock, breaking his jaw, orbital bone, crushing his cheekbone and fracturing his skull. He also broke his hand and badly bruised his pelvic bone by picking him up and throwing him into a cement and metal post.  

The dad was transported to the local hospital, was stabilized and then transported to a specialized trauma center one state away where he underwent surgery to stabilize his head and insert metal plates in his face, head and jaw as well as wire his jaw shut. The dad, who is a brilliant person, now has a difficult time making decisions or remembering things. 

This family has spent over a year basically as prisoners in their own home. Locking doors, staying up all night- taking turns guarding the home, pets and the mom. The constant disruption has wrecked their finances and the day after the dads surgery, while he was in the hospital, their landlord was in court kicking the family out of the home. They are now in a very temporary residence with their pets. They have to be out of there by this coming Monday. The dad still faces several surgeries. They have no idea what to do.

One adult son out of three developed paranoid schizophrenia. The family has called the police department to take the son to the ER for a mental health check over a dozen times in the past year. The police refused nearly every time, saying that &amp;#39;he looked fine to them&amp;#39;. The son was taken in for brief periods 2 times during this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The son became violent, kicking in doors and attacking the mom in his psychosis and still the police refused to take him in for an ER check- through three attacks on the family, even knowing that mental health professionals were waiting to evaluate the son.

So since then, my insurance (Allstate) has been amazing and are pretty much doing the leg work since her insurance (State Farm) is taking their sweet time. I was told today that my car might be deemed a total loss. My car is a 2015 Toyota Camry SE with 50k miles. 

She hit me right where the back door meets the trunk right where the tire is. I guess she knocked all of the stuff under my car out. I’m sorry, I’m not a car person so I don’t know any of the real terms.

If they deem my car a loss, they’re saying I may get somewhere around $14k back. I still owe roughly $9k on the car that I bought at the end of 2015 for $30k. I’ll walk away with no car and a check for $5k if I’m lucky.

We just moved from East Troy, WI to Pittsburgh, PA, and had a terrible experience after hiring Company

They advertise handling your move so it's stress free and say its often cheaper to use their services because your things are loaded with other loads to share the cost. We were moving quickly and decided it would be easier to just hire a moving company, one less thing to worry about. It was an awful experience, feels like such a scam, and I'm wondering if we have any grounds for legal action. 

They're a broker, so we did understand they would hire someone to physically do our move. However, we had no idea that they had no standards for who they hire. The contractor they hired is on every ""black list"" of movers to avoid and also had an F rating on BBB. We didn't know this until after we started having issues. They picked up our things in two loads due to poor planning, which delayed both us leaving and us receiving our things on the other end. They were extremely unresponsive, at one point ignoring calls and texts for a full 24 hours on the day they were supposed to come, after already having not shown up the previous day. When they finally showed up to our new place, they required us to pay by cash or money order BEFORE they would unload our stuff. Budget had originally quoted us about $3,500-$4,000. We ended up being charged well over $8,000. They do say it's by weight, but I just don't buy that their estimate should more than double. They do this for a living and we went through a detailed inventory list over the phone. When we called company’s customer service, they basically said, ""Not our problem, you signed an agreement with the contractor"", as if we had had a choice in working with that contractor.

I feel like they intentionally misrepresented their services. If they advertise that they handle your move, they should be your primary point of contact and they should take responsibility for who they hired. We had zero say in who moved our stuff and we never would have chosen company had we known they would send a super sketchy and unprofessional contractor and then bail. This whole situation was just sketchy. In the end, we did get our stuff, though with some damage. But the process was just terrible, especially for the insane amount of money they made us pay.

If you read this far, thank you! I'm open to any thoughts or advice on if there's anything to be done here. I would just really like to be able to hold them accountable in some way for the ridiculous price we ended up paying for the terrible and unprofessional service we received.

I didn't do anything wrong but was being sued for a known complication beyond my control.  My defense was being paid for by my malpractice insurance.  Initially, the hospital was also named in the lawsuit, but was eventually dropped.  The case was progressing towards trial and I had a conference call with the insurance company asking if I would be willing to settle.  Since the case was easily defendable and, in my own and expert's opinions, I had not violated the standard of care,  I refused to settle.  I was notified that the hospital was pushing to settle the case because they didn't want negative publicity.  I still refused to settle.  I was told that since the hospital was the purchaser of the policy, they could direct the insurance company to settle without my consent.  Eventually, the plaintiff's attorney, the insurance company, and the hospital met and settled the case for a very low amount.

This doesn't seem right to me.  I had a contract with the hospital in which it was agreed they would provide ME with malpractice insurance.  They were dropped from the lawsuit.  I don't see how they should even be involved after that point.  They were pushing to settle to negate any adverse publicity, but I'm left with the consequences.  The malpractice lawsuit will now be reported to the state boards and I'll have a negative report on my practitioner's databank.  I will have to report the settlement to every new position or license I apply for.  Even though it was settled and there is no guilt admitted on my part, it will still be seen and interpreted as guilt.  All for a suit my lawyer was confident we would win.

I was told that since the hospital was the purchaser of the policy, they could direct the insurance company to settle without my consent.  Eventually, the plaintiff&amp;#39;s attorney, the insurance company, and the hospital met and settled the case for a very low amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t seem right to me.  I had a contract with the hospital in which it was agreed they would provide ME with malpractice insurance.  They were dropped from the lawsuit.  I don&amp;#39;t see how they should even be involved after that point.  They were pushing to settle to negate any adverse publicity, but I&amp;#39;m left with the consequences.  The malpractice lawsuit will now be reported to the state boards and I&amp;#39;ll have a negative report on my practitioner&amp;#39;s databank.  I will have to report the settlement to every new position or license I apply for.  Even though it was settled and there is no guilt admitted on my part, it will still be seen and interpreted as guilt.  All for a suit my lawyer was confident we would win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is this even possible?  In my state the insurance company can settle without consent, but it has to go through a panel for approval and is very very rare.  I don&amp;#39;t see how the hospital can be viewed as the insured and consent to settle when my policy lists ME as insured.&lt;/p&gt;

(Nebraska, USA)

Very long story short here, with hopefully only relevant details.

Background: Grandma (90s) is anxious about meds. She's getting on hospice so POA (A) doesnt reorder meds (hospice is suppose to bring in Monday, when they do their first visit). Grandma decides Friday of a holiday weekend to cancel hospice so... no meds Monday and has to go to doctor Tuesday to get new scripts. Tells doctor A is withholding meds (not the case, but grandma is anxious about meds and didnt understand why A wouldnt order them even after explaining about hospice, people stay set in their ways I guess).

So A is having medical emergency and is not available. Grandma contacts long estranged relative to be POA, to help her with her medical appointments and meds, etc. They agree with terms ""You give me everything when you die"". Grandma says okay, sure. POA (B) moves money around, changes locks, uses grandmas money to pay to change will and locks (I assume that's normal). Lawyer uses his own family as witnesses for the new will that cuts out everyone but B (weird to me but I'm not a lawyer so maybe normal, not really the question lol).

A finds out, is confused but says okay, sure let someone else handle it then. Few days later, grandma calls A bawling. B wont take care of her. B refuses to take to her get lab work because ""thata not a doctors appointment"". Wont help her get care set up in her home.  Begs A to please help her again. Grandma is suicidal at this point, begging for the keys to her car to drive off a bridge because of this 'huge mistake' shes made and now she's 'all alone'. A drops everything (literally left a cart mid shipping trip) and drives an hour to comfort her and figure things out.

They get POA changed back finally, almost everything is figured out when grandma falls and breaks something when home alone. Story past that is pretty much irrelevant to my question.

First, is it reportable abuse that she refused to help her with her medical care when that was their agreement?

Second, grandma told A that B brought her to a pawn shop to sell all of her wedding jewelry for cash (got under 500, and there was no reason for it. Grandma is plenty well off and paid for the locks and lawyer out of pocket) and no one understands why. I think B went back and bought it herself BUT, it is reportable abuse to force her to sell sentimental items when its really not financially necessary?

Is there ANYTHING ELSE you see in my story as abuse that I'm missing? I've already told A to have APS look into it because it gives me bad vibes, but was that the right route? Should we be doing more?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what to flair this. It&amp;#39;s about abuse reporting mostly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background: Grandma (90s) is anxious about meds. She&amp;#39;s getting on hospice so POA (A) doesnt reorder meds (hospice is suppose to bring in Monday, when they do their first visit). Grandma decides Friday of a holiday weekend to cancel hospice so... no meds Monday and has to go to doctor Tuesday to get new scripts. Tells doctor A is withholding meds (not the case, but grandma is anxious about meds and didnt understand why A wouldnt order them even after explaining about hospice, people stay set in their ways I guess).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So A is having medical emergency and is not available. Grandma contacts long estranged relative to be POA, to help her with her medical appointments and meds, etc. They agree with terms &amp;quot;You give me everything when you die&amp;quot;. Grandma says okay, sure. POA (B) moves money around, changes locks, uses grandmas money to pay to change will and locks (I assume that&amp;#39;s normal). Lawyer uses his own family as witnesses for the new will that cuts out everyone but B (weird to me but I&amp;#39;m not a lawyer so maybe normal, not really the question lol).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A finds out, is confused but says okay, sure let someone else handle it then. Few days later, grandma calls A bawling. B wont take care of her. B refuses to take to her get lab work because &amp;quot;thata not a doctors appointment&amp;quot;. Wont help her get care set up in her home.  Begs A to please help her again. Grandma is suicidal at this point, begging for the keys to her car to drive off a bridge because of this &amp;#39;huge mistake&amp;#39; shes made and now she&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;all alone&amp;#39;. A drops everything (literally left a cart mid shipping trip) and drives an hour to comfort her and figure things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They get POA changed back finally, almost everything is figured out when grandma falls and breaks something when home alone. Story past that is pretty much irrelevant to my question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, is it reportable abuse that she refused to help her with her medical care when that was their agreement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, grandma told A that B brought her to a pawn shop to sell all of her wedding jewelry for cash (got under 500, and there was no reason for it. Grandma is plenty well off and paid for the locks and lawyer out of pocket) and no one understands why. I think B went back and bought it herself BUT, it is reportable abuse to force her to sell sentimental items when its really not financially necessary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there ANYTHING ELSE you see in my story as abuse that I&amp;#39;m missing? I&amp;#39;ve already told A to have APS look into it because it gives me bad vibes, but was that the right route? Should we be doing more?&lt;/p&gt;

Okay. I've been doing tons of research on LLCs, S corps, C corps, etc. and I am going crazy. Taking in massive amounts of information on the subject has caused a bit of an overload and I can't seem to differentiate which details correspond with which.. 'entity' if you will. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to obtain an EIN (in Pennsylvania) for tax purposes. I am an independent contractor doing transcription work from home. Recently, I qualified to transcribe for a Law Enforcement transcription service company and they require an EIN for sending out whatever the equivalent of a w2 is for independent contractors... The content I'll be transcribing contains sensitive information and therefore the company requires background checks and fingerprinting, all the works. Including all of this legal shit, an EIN.. and to be identified as \*either\* a sole-proprietor OR a Limited Liability Company, S corp, or C corp.  Do I need to register somewhere to be a sole proprietor, or is it as simple as self-identifying as one? In order to obtain an EIN, must I register as an LLC even though it will always be a one-person business? What is all this stuff about fictitious names and such - can I just use my legal name as a sole proprietor, or does the whole 'naming' thing only relate to LLCs? 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I can tell, LLCs are for individuals who want to start a business AND hire employees to work for them. Also, as far as I can tell, sole-proprietors are any individual who offers goods and services and receives payment in return.  

&amp;#x200B;

So. As I said, I've taken in a LOT of information over the last several hours and I can't seem to keep my shit straight. It's a new subject for me and I've never had to do any of this for other at-home transcription companies. I understand there are a lot of questions here, and I'm sorry to be a bit all over the place. However, anyone with any answers to \*any\* of the questions is greatly appreciated. Thank you!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;PA, USA &lt;/p&gt;

It stemmed from several F4 &amp; F5 charged relating to credit card fraud, theft from an elderly adult, etc. 


The warrant was issued after he didn’t pay the fines and go to meetings and such. 


He has no violent or sexual charges or history, but has a few smaller drug charges from when he was younger.


He can’t work because of the warrant and his license / registration have both been suspended. Their relationship has grown increasingly more strained as a result of this and they’re now on the verge of a breakup.


He knows he needs to get it taken care of so they can move on with their lives, but he’s also scared of what will happen, how the process will work, etc.
Complicating matters is the fact that they rent an apartment and he is not listed on the lease (at the time she didn’t want to risk not getting the apartment due to his record as it is a “nicer” snooty area and they needed to move somewhere immediately. As a result he’s technically not allowed to be living there but it’s been over a year and no issues) so he doesn’t know what to say if they ask where he lives or where he would be living upon release. He doesn’t want to give their address, go through a verification (if there even is a process for this - they’re not sure if the police would check or not), and then have her get evicted and be homeless too.


They do not have money for a lawyer and she has reached out multiple times over the past 8 months to several low cost or pro bono ones in the area and no one has contacted her back. They’re both frustrated and I can see it’s hurting them a lot.


I’m trying to gather as much information as I possibly can in order to give to them so things can be sat down, planned, and they can move on. She’s put so much of her life on hold for him because of this issue and I know he just wants her to be able to have everything they’ve talked about but it can’t happen until he gets his shit together.


Any information about potential jail time, the process of what he would go through, what to do about their housing (where does he say he lives?), or any other information you can think of is incredibly helpful and appreciated.

Namely, the employer was running a tip pool without any documentation and the employees believed she was taking the tips to balance the till, and many outright believed theft was going on.

Also; she was not paying regular overtime to her standard employees under the guise of ""tourism means no overtime"".

I spoke to her about the tips and she explained it was a pool, and I said I had my concerns about documentation and using it to settle tills, and that the employment standards specifically states that if it was used to balance tills/expenses, that it needs to be repaid to the employees.

I received an email the next day dismissing me, so I promptly filed a complaint against the owner with the ministry of labor. 

Today, after 5 weeks, I suddenly received an email from the ministry closing my claim, stating that they had received an employee package from the owner (after waiting 5 weeks), that claimed that I was fired for good cause.

When looking at the evidence as provided by the agent... its an employee file that has been CLEARLY fabricated.  

Im happy to provide specifics, but it was things like claiming I refused to upsell, or get my hands dirty, or refusing to charge customers for extras. They specifically said employees had complained, and named them by name.

One employee specifically, I know 100% his complaint is completely fabricated. A man I worked shoulder to shoulder with, and the document states that I refused to get my hands dirty or prep.

I don't even think that the Ministry looked into the underlying claims regarding the tips or overtime.

----

The reason why I am posting here are to get answers to the following questions and solicit advice.

1) How can they dismiss my claim without giving me an opportunity to dispute or provide evidence disputing these claims?

2) If I can go and speak to the employee that I had good relations with, and collect evidence that his statement was made without his approval and fabricated, would this help my case or would you advise against speaking to him?

3) How can the ministry of labour not even investigate the underlying abuses of the employment standard act, when its my complaint that the employer fired me to protect those thefts/abuses?

4) Can I, through legal representation, get evidence through subpeona regarding the tip pool, overtime being paid to employees, and other evidence to show that she was breaking the law and fired me to protect herself?

5) I've received a referral through the law society for a 30 minute consultation for free, does anyone have any advice on what sort of things I should have ready to speak to them?

6) Does anyone have any further advice, questions, or things that they can help me with?

I'm a hard worker, I was trying to protect the employees beneath me, and i'm an honourable man.

I'm absolutely destroyed by the actions of the ministry today, and I don't feel protected as a worker.. at all.

So my house has three fences. This question refers to the back fence, which I share with the neighbor on the next street.

There are small trees/shrubs that are indeed on my side of the fence, within three inches of sprouting they immediately curl and twist and have broken through much of my fencing and go into the neighbors yard.  They then grew to about 8-10’ tall. I say these are trees but they are more like invasive bushes/shrubs with many thousands of “branching” branches. In the last few weeks these branches sprouted thousands of leaves and made the fence line look pretty trashy.

My wife asked me to trim them up. So I did. I spent 6-8 hours cutting the thousands of small branches, which fell mostly on my side of the fence.

I then dug the roots up, and clipped them at the point they left my side of the fence and pulled them free. Because of this, the middle side of the trees/brushes fell on my neighbors side of the fence—since both the roots and the ends that had curled up over the top of the fence we’re on my side.

My neighbor spent a great many hours heaving these branches up over the fences onto my side. Normally, I’d dispose of these but the city requires extra payment to getting rid of tree branches and this may amount to more than a paltry sum.

I am of the mind these branches belong to my neighbor but I understand I may be wrong, because the trees were rooted on my side. Can someone help me out?

I have CCTV footage of him heaving the branches over my fence like some Olympic sport at almost midnight, as well.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

He throws a pillow at me, I get up to throw it back at him and he takes me to the ground. At this point, everything gets whirlwindy and I’m not 100% sure who was even in the room. Now, he (~190 lb guy) is on top of me (125 lb girl) restraining me to the ground. Next thing i know, he has his hands around my neck, then proceeds to put his hand over my mouth so I couldn’t scream. Out of the corner of my ear, I hear the mom that present say “you know you like it”, which is mind boggling as i’m screaming stop it, get off, i can’t breathe. Finally, he puts a pillow over top of
my face multiple times, in which i obviously couldn’t breathe. I somehow escaped just as my two friends come back in the room and then i proceeded to run away and cry. Here’s where it gets messy, the next day I told my mom
and she was obviously furious. She calls my ex’s mom and is very cordial and nice considering I have bruises all over my body. This also isn’t the first ignorant encounter with him, last year on a school trip he proceeded to call me
the n word (hard r) when i wouldn’t re add him on social media. His mom said she would talk to him and the mother who’s house it was at and call my mom back. Well, turns out she blocked my moms phone number. After finding out this and that my ex was completely twisting
the story, my mom calls the mom who’s house we were at. The mom answers and you can instantly tell she’s drunk and everything she’s saying is super calculated and rehearsed. She’s been thinking about what she was gonna say. To our knowledge, we’re assuming she’s trying to

She is doing this on the psychiatric department of a hospital. The psychiatrist who is supposed to oversee and guide her is a bit of a douche to say the least, he's quite a toxic person and he is about to fail her for this rotation without much reason.
When she came in on the first day virtually nothing was explained to her about how the department works and what would be expected of her, as a matter of fact she never got any introductory training, instead she was just put to work. Now I understand that this is also something you can learn a lot from given adequate supervision and guidance. These things were however lacking, she did occasionally get told that she does certain things wrong, however, when she then asked further she never got any concrete answers as to what exactly was wrong or how she could improve.
In other words, the psychiatrist never really taught her anything (keep in mind she was supposed to learn there and paid tuition to be there). This rotation was meant to last 12 weeks, however, after 12 weeks the psychiatrist said she was not performing sufficiently (remember nowhere in these 12 weeks was she told what constitutes a sufficient performance) and after mediation it was decided to add another 4 weeks to the rotation with more intensive guidance. One meeting per day to discuss progress and her functioning was decided. That was two weeks ago. So far most of these meetings have been cancelled (by him) and he has just filled out an intermediate report that was quite bad which strongly indicates that he intends to fail her.
I would argue that since he at no point made any move to correct her, teach her or say anything constructive to her he cannot possibly fail her as he apparently never thought she was doing things wrong but I would like to hear the opinion of some legally schooled people.

  Backstory: My mom has been battling stage 3 breast cancer for the last 4 or 5 years. After trying everything she could in the U.S (PNW) she was accepted into a German clinic for a treatment that would require repeat visits. In June 2017 after she landed in Frankfurt for her second treatment, as she was getting into the taxi that was hired by the clinic to pick her up, she started getting into the back seat but the driver stopped her and suggested she get into the front seat instead. When she went to grab the safety handle above the passengers door to pull herself into the seat, the handle itself popped out of the door frame and the shock of the handle coming loose snapped her left arm Humerus. At that point she passed out, then came to on the ground next to the taxi with her left arm folded underneath her. An ambulance was called and as they were loading her into that she, and a paramedic, witnessed the taxi driver popping the handle in the taxi back into place like it wasn't broken at all.   
  My mom had come to Germany for a scheduled 2 weeks, but spent the first 4 days in a Frankfurt hospital instead of getting cancer treatment at the clinic. During those 4 days she came down with multiple infections, including MRSA. Luckily, once she finally made it to the clinic, they were able to culture antibiotics to fight the infections and she eventually recovered, but the entire situation rendered the actual cancer treatment impossible for that visit. She had spent upwards of 10,000$ basically to have broken her arm in a different country.   
  Since that point she has spent so much time fighting infections from her broken arm, that her cancer went rampant, and she now has been given less than a year.   
  The clinic itself took the first steps addressing the incident, but the taxi driver decided to take the route of denying the accident had happened at all. When the clinic confronted the driver via their taxi company, the driver basically said that my mom was lying and that she didn't break her arm at all and was making the whole thing up, despite the paramedics responding to her on the ground next to the taxi and witnessing the driver covering up evidence by just popping the handle back in the frame so it didn't look broken. While my mom still had plans to continue going to Germany to get the intended treatment, the doctor who owned the clinic had been assuring her that they were working on resolving the issue and getting her compensated for the wasted trip and ensuing pain and suffering. Around 3 months later she went back for another treatment, only to discover that they weren't working and that she wasn't going to get anything out of going to the clinic at all in the future, so she stopped that route of treatment. Since then the clinic has stopped responding to her inquiries about her case, so at this point she has no idea of whether the issue is being addressed at all.   
  Cancer is expensive and she spent a lot of money going to Germany to try and save her life only to have it be the thing that will eventually kill her. I 100% believe that her breaking her arm, and the ensuing infections, are the reason her treatments failed and she is looking at just months left.   


So lawyers of reddit, I need help in knowing just how much of a case we have here, and what steps i can take to see that my family is compensated for the trauma and that my dad is not made to suffer even more when left with the debt of her illness.

  Backstory: My mom has been battling stage 3 breast cancer for the last 4 or 5 years. After trying everything she could in the U.S (PNW) she was accepted into a German clinic for a treatment that would require repeat visits. In June 2017 after she landed in Frankfurt for her second treatment, as she was getting into the taxi that was hired by the clinic to pick her up, she started getting into the back seat but the driver stopped her and suggested she get into the front seat instead. When she went to grab the safety handle above the passengers door to pull herself into the seat, the handle itself popped out of the door frame and the shock of the handle coming loose snapped her left arm Humerus. At that point she passed out, then came to on the ground next to the taxi with her left arm folded underneath her. An ambulance was called and as they were loading her into that she, and a paramedic, witnessed the taxi driver popping the handle in the taxi back into place like it wasn&amp;#39;t broken at all.&lt;br/&gt;

We are selling our house and it hit escrow today.

I got this person's phone number and called them. From here on out, I will refer to this person as **\[landlord\]** and the property they own as **\[neighbor's house\].**

I called **\[landlord\]'s** home number and they claimed that they rent the house to someone we will refer to as **\[tenant\].** They claim that **\[tenant\]** is leaving the rental because our tree is hanging over their property and dumping leaves and debris on their yard. She said **\[tenant\]** cannot stand it, they tried to have a BBQ but canceled it because it was so dirty from our tree, and our tree is killing plants in their back yard. I asked for **\[tenant\]'s** contact info so that I could get details on what is happening and **\[landlord\]** said ""They moved out already"".

I went to **\[neighbor's house\]** and it turns out **\[tenant\]** is still there. I spoke with **\[tenant\]** and they said that **\[landlord\]'s** claims are ""bullshit"", **\[landlord\]** is ""crazy"", and that the tree is not a problem for **\[tenant\]** at all. **\[tenant\]** also said they never planned a BBQ. The real reason they are moving is because they have a neighbor next to them who suffers from mental illness and is making their lives difficult. He said this neighbor scares **\[tenant\]'s** kids, and they cannot stand to live near this person anymore. **\[tenant\]** sent an email to me confirming this in their own words.

After she hit me, I called 911 to get a police report and took pictures of the damage. One of the other victims walked over to me and saw my car had been destroyed. After the police arrived at the scene, they asked for information about the make and model of the suspect's car and the suspect herself, which I gave to them. The other victim provided a similar description. I gave them all the information I had about the incident for their police report. It matched what the other present victim had described. I was given the officer's phone number and email, and he told me they would try to find the suspect.

After a few days, I called the officer and was told the suspect was likely found about two block away from the site of the accident. However, given that police allegedly did not discover her in the vehicle, and she was likely inside her house, they were not legally allowed to enter and ask her questions (this was the explanation I received). Meanwhile, I was trying to file a claim with my car insurance, and the insurance company wanted a police report to validate my claim. My car was evaluated as a total loss. Despite lacking a police report, I was luckily deemed not at-fault, even without a police report, after the insurance company looked at my driving record.

I tried to contact my city's police department several times in the following weeks, to follow up on the claim and seek some kind of justice. They finally called back in September, two whole months later. FYI, this is way outside the time frame a typical insurance company expects a police report, so even though they cut me some slack, it still didn't look great when they would call asking if I had received it yet. The police department informed me that the report had been lost due to a recent IT upgrade, and incidentally, I later confirmed this with another officer totally uninvolved in the case who happened to let it slip.

They asked me for some basic information about my car (e.g. make, model, year, color), nothing about the incident, and logged it as Crash Report, which apparently doesn't create a criminal or civil record or case, just a report held by the DOT. No consequences, no justice. Nothing.

This incident severely impacted me. The driver was driving at recklessly high speeds, and had I not made a quick turn when she was about to hit me, I feel I could have sustained life-threatening injuries, in addition to the destruction of my car. Not to mention it was a few weeks before I was planning to move and had planned on using that vehicle.

Do I have any recourse? It's frustrating that the state of Wisconsin just doesn't seem to hold certain people accountable. It seems like its all about who you know in this corrupt state.

Hi guys. Around 6 years ago, I was arrested for a misdemeanor. Although my fingerprints were not taken, I did get a photo taken. I was very young and the officer seemed to display sympathy.

I then retained a lawyer at the time, and eventually he told me the case was dismissed and I am not convicted.

However, I never got a mail saying that I need to do a fingerprints OR that I need to show up at the court. Therefore, I am wondering if my arrest was even booked at all to begin with (meaning the lawyer did not have to do anything). I remember, for instance, he advised me against to go to the precinct or court to get the properties they collected as an evidence. When I asked him recently if I can get the arrest record sealed, he said it is too late (is there really such thing as too late to get record expunged)?

I am about to apply for a job, and my employer will conduct a FBI background search. Thus, I am a bit worried about the arrest record. As my former lawyer seems not so friendly to answer my questions, I am asking here. Thank you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[CA] &lt;/p&gt;

About three months after submitting the paperwork and talking to multiple managers, I decided to follow up because I still had not heard back. Turns out they had no record of my paperwork, and even though it was all done through the company’s HR website, they said they “lost it.” So I begin again, and fill out all the necessary paperwork one more time. This time I follow up constantly and keep badgering managers to see if anything came back and when my accommodation can start, because as stated I’m in constant pain. 

Now it’s been six months since the accident, 3 since I resubmitted the paperwork and still nothing. When I try to talk with managers about the situation they brush it off and make it clear it’s not a priority for them. I want to call HR, but coworkers have warned me not to, saying that it could backfire and upset management, then they really won’t help me now or in the future with promotions. 

I spoke with another coworker who is going through the same thing, except she’s been trying to get an accommodation for over a year. I’m at the point where I cry every day on my way into work because I know how much pain I’m going to be in that day and I don’t know what to do. Not sure if this is the right sub for this, but any help is appreciated. Can my management really hold it against me if I call HR? I don’t want to have to quit and my accommodation isn’t very unreasonable in my opinion so I’m not sure what to do

It’s been a few months but some people have been asking for an update to this. 

Once we threatened to go to the police, my friends sister and mom got the necklace back within a few hours. 

We did still go to the police, but they told us there wasn’t much they could do since we had the necklace back, but we were welcome to file a report. 

Her sister begged for a chance to get her shit together, so we gave her two weeks to turn her life around. I think this whole thing was a wake up call, because it worked. 

She graduated from basic training last weekend and is moving on to a specialized training next week! We’re all incredibly proud of her and how much she’s changed (well, except her mom but that’s /r/raisedbynarcissists territory). 

My friend has invested in a safe and everything is locked away, even though it isn’t much of a worry anymore.

Everything has been going fine since we moved in, but recently has gotten bad fast. It started when the downstairs hit our garage door a second time which broke the door to a point where it wouldn't close. After contacting the landlord her and her boyfriend( who is a slum lord in a near by city) arrived after about a week. Our landlord was about to agree to fixing the door till her boyfriend said that he wouldn't. He said this since it can be opened and closed manually with the release cord on the motor in the garage. After another week of back and forth with our landlord we decided to get a local garage door repair gut to fix it. We decided the best option was to switch the panels of our door with the neighbors door. This would be fine for the neighbors because they don't use they're garage door much and they have the side door. This would cost $200 to do so we asked the landlord if we could take half of the cost out of our rent; we already have done this system when we painted the apartment and got new blinds for it. Without surprise she declined so we did it with the full cost on us. But wait there's more. The day of when our repair guy finished the door a guy hired by the landlord showed up to finish the roof. Everything was normal until the ""roofer"" showed up at about 9pm. He turned on the air compressor that is hanging above the downstairs neighbors porch roof by a rope and started nailing away. This kept everyone awake in the house. This went on till about 9:45pm. The next day which is today he showed up again to work and then later a few minutes past 9pm nailing away. My mom went out this time after unplugging his air compressor earlier in the day to tell him that people are trying to sleep. He said it'll only be 20 minutes, but he just finished for now at 9:49pm. Also we have found out the roof was left unfinished since this guy was put in prison for meth mid way through construction. He also left a box cutter on the neighbors porch along with nails for the nail gun facing point up. These were both unattended and the neighbors have 2 young special needs kids. Luckily neither got into these on their porch.

&amp;#x200B;

I went out with a couple of friends- let's call my friend Deb, her boyfriend Ulises, and my other friend Ivan (bc I feel like I shouldn't mention their real names lol). On the way home from LA (California), Ulises had a few sips of alcohol. Ulises was driving us all home with Deb sitting at the passenger's seat, me behind her, and Ivan next to me (and behind the driver). Though he gassed up the vehicle quite a bit, I wasn't too worried because I trusted him. Pretty soon we went on to reach 120, then 124 (we told him to slow down but I think he took it jokingly), 127, and 128 where we almost collided with another car on the right lane next to us while trying to stick to the freeway's curve (the freeway had a left bend after a few miles of straight road). To avoid hitting the car, Ulises swerved the wheel to the left and we instead rammed the freeway barrier because we were going too fast to make the turn/curve. We spun out for a good while and kept on hitting the barrier with every spin- I honestly thought I was going to die. Thankfully, we didn't hit any other cars and vice versa. 

I had seatbelt burn along my neck and waist (since I was sitting at a weird position when the accident occurred). My neck was choked out as a result of the position I was at when I was being jostled around- I was facing the left side door so the majority of my pains come from my right side. 

A few moments later after the crash, some sheriffs rolled by and got our statements and what not. Ulises was breathalyzed and was issued a DUI. He and his family are currently trying to get it scrubbed off and we'll find out the outcome of his case within a few days. The sheriffs got our names and took the report. 

The days following the accident, Ulises kept on reassuring me that his father would be down to cover all of my medical bills so long as I don't litigate his son. My family felt bad about requesting money like that, but we really aren't in the position to be so lax with our financials at the moment. I went to see a doctor a couple of times, got scans taken for my injuries, and am now seeing a chiropractor. I figured that I should just compile the bills into one single bunch before sending them off to Ulises (hence why I didn't just send him receipt after receipt immediately after receiving them). After days and weeks of apologies, reassuring me that his family would help take care of my bills and telling me not to feel bad about receiving the help, he messaged me one night to tell me that his father wasn't down to help me with my bills anymore. I had never sent him a receipt prior to that. I was shocked and didn't expect him to pull out just like that after already having made promises that he'd help me. Apparently, his mother thinks that I'm faking my injuries to get money from them and that his father doesn't take me seriously anymore because I didn't litigate Ulises. It hurt very much to hear that since I never had intentions to extort money from Ulises and his family by suing him for the accident. 

At this point, I can't really afford to pay off my bills on my own and would like his family to stick by the offer that they put out. I kind of feel like I had a carpet pulled right out from under me. Ulises has told said that he intends on helping me out after he gets a job -he's a nice guy and willing to take responsibility for what happened- but I don't think he's in the position to be able to afford to help me out with my bills alone without his parents' aid. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point or what my options even are. My chiropractor doesn't know how long it'll take me to finish therapy (could be months), so I won't have a definite amount for those bills. Could I sue to just have Ulises' parents stick to their word of helping with my medical bills? Could I get them to sign an agreement saying that they'd pay for my treatment until completion?

Should I sue, would my case be weakened if Ulises manages to get that DUI scrubbed off? What're my chances for winning something like this?

&amp;#x200B;

Some of you might remember me from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c65xni/am_i_a_citizen/) post. You guys rushed to reassure me, and some of you gave me some *really*helpful advice. So, thank you for that!

&amp;#x200B;

I do have one more question, though.

&amp;#x200B;

Way back in 2017, I was ticketed (***not*** arrested, I feel the need to stress this) in NC (where I live while I'm in school) for both driving with a license I didn't know was suspended, as well as driving with expired tags. The reason for this suspension was that I had missed a court date for a separate traffic offense.

&amp;#x200B;

This part is important : the separate violation was that I was driving with expired tags. The title of the vehicle I was driving at the time was in the name of my grandmother, who had died the previous year. As such, I had to get *new* tags. However, getting new tags required a transfer of title to someone who could be in person with me at the DMV. So, in the meantime, my parents (foolishly) told me to just drive with the tags and explain myself if I ever got pulled over.

&amp;#x200B;

When I eventually did get pulled over and ticketed for driving with expired tags, I went and paid the ticket, which I thought was the end of that. I was under the impression (based off what my parents had also, foolishly, told me) that paying the ticket meant I didn't have to go to court at all.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I didn't go. Stupid, I know. I just didn't know.

&amp;#x200B;

In response to getting this ticket for the suspended license, I immediately went and paid the court fines for my prior violation (like the same day), and paid to have my license reinstated (the following day). The week after, the title for the car was lifted out of probate, so I was also finally able to get new tags as well!

&amp;#x200B;

So, I went to my court date with my new tags and reinstated license, and they let both go. To be clear: ***I walked out of the courthouse paying for neither the tags ticket, nor the Driving With a Suspended License ticket***.

&amp;#x200B;

So, with all this expository bullshit out of the way, here is my question: I've been reading about how the number of immigrants CBP/ICE have been rounding up with misdemeanor charges has sharply increased.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what position I'm in?

&amp;#x200B;

Am I fair game for these agencies' efforts? Technically DWSSL in NC is a Class 3 Misdemeanor, but also technically I appear to be a citizen, but also I technically still need to get official documentation of that, so I just still feel very on edge.

He has spent many nights at other women’s houses and had an affair (he won’t admit anything physical happened but I have evidence that it did) with his son’s mother during my pregnancy and even after our child was born. When I attempted suicide he didn’t call the police, he called my mother who had me spend that night at her house. After that I packed up all of my things and left with the baby.

He drives drunk even with the children in the car very often, he wakes up and drinks in the morning when he has to be going to work at 10am and if he doesn’t work until the evening he can easily go through 3/4 of a fifth of bourbon before work. Every night he drinks enough to be unconscious by 4am. I can’t let my daughter be around that.

I have gotten professional help after my suicide attempt, I’m in therapy twice a week. I’m doing really well now that I’m out of the situation that pushed me to that point and my therapist believes I don’t need to be on any medication or anything and that it was just suffering constant abuse that pushed me to be so done with life. She advised that I should not leave my daughter alone with him and that if I do, she would be required to call social services as he doesn’t wake up when she cries in the night and doesn’t feed her nearly as much/ as often as an infant should be. I have brought her over to see him twice since I left, when he has the time, and he just lays her on the floor and plays video games the whole time. 

I am still on the lease for our apartment and I’ve been paying my part of the rent, but two weeks ago he changed the locks and won’t give me a key. I’ve been advised that he cannot do that and it’s “false eviction” even if I’ve moved out, I don’t know how true that is. He told me that he’s required by law to see her one afternoon and one overnight visit per week until I have a court ordered parenting plan, I’ve found things that suggest that to be true but given the situation I am not comfortable leaving her alone with him and don’t want to get social services involved per my therapist. He doesn’t actually have the time to see her that often anyway, the one time I let him have her overnight he had me drop her off at 2am when he got home (she was asleep) and come pick her up at 8am. 

I’m wondering what I’m required to do here? Do I have to let him have her unsupervised twice a week, and if I don’t will that look really bad when I do take him to court about this eventually? How to I prove his alcoholism and my concerns about it to someone viewing this case later on? I’ve talked to the leasing office about getting off the lease but he doesn’t make enough money for me to do that, can I do anything to be able to get the last of my things out of the apartment that I still pay for?

I have lived abroad since 2015 and have avoided any sort of repercussions on this. The one largest creditor has tried to sue me in civil courts in two states (the first one being where my family lives, the second being where I set up a mail forwarding account with a company that sends me my physical mail from America).

In the first time they filed suit a physical attempt to serve me failed since I didn't live there (my stepfather just told the person I don't live here and they left without trying again), and in the second state their lawyers sent certified letters: one was returned unopened, the other not signed for and seems to have gone missing by the mail forwarding company (although I know it was sent as I saw a photo of it, since they send photos of all mail to me before forwarding it). In both cases the creditor's lawyer dropped the suits, I assume because they failed to serve to me.

My question: if I can wait out the SoL for my debts (5 years in both states, btw), can they try to extend the SoL somehow or still sue me for the debts?

I remember reading through the conditional license application form thoroughly at the DMV when I went last, I noticed there was no written statements confirming they may be an issue with driving to work out of state with a conditional license.

I still felt like it may be something that I would have to research further into to find a definite answer. So I called NYS DMV and asked whether or not you could. She stated to me as well, that there is nothing written on the NY conditional license application form stating you may not drive out of state for work.

From what I took from it, it seems like the result is variable and that could be depending on the person standing behind the counter at the DMV.

A little sketchy but I am positive many others, including myself, live in NY and work in bordering states (MA, PA, NJ etc.)

&lt;p&gt;I remember reading through the conditional license application form thoroughly at the DMV when I went last, I noticed there was no written statements confirming they may be an issue with driving to work out of state with a conditional license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still felt like it may be something that I would have to research further into to find a definite answer. So I called NYS DMV and asked whether or not you could. She stated to me as well, that there is nothing written on the NY conditional license application form stating you may not drive out of state for work.

So this might stink of 'privilege' or kid with rich parents complaining about first world problems, but it's a real issue I'm facing and, in my defence, I moved out of home at a very young age and worked to get to the position I'm in now myself.

This is going to be a long post, and I don't even know if this is the correct place for this. If there's a better place then feel free to let me know and I'll post it there.

&amp;#x200B;

So my mum came to me and said that she'd like to put a deposit down on a house for me as a gift, essentially my inheritance come early. We talked about things that were important to me (close to public transport, decent internet, not an apartment, no more than $700,000 as I wouldn't be able to easily afford the mortgage, multiple bedrooms so I could rent them out to help me pay the mortgage/bills).

Fast forward and she saw a house she loved and bought it without me seeing the house. It was 20 minutes walk to any public transport, had no internet options above 2mb/s and cost over $1,100,000. Then she told me that we would be half owners on the house, not that it would be mine. At this point I really considered not signing the paper to tie myself down to a house that I didn't agree to, with a person who changes the deal. However the fact that it was my mum and she would lose hundreds of thousands of dollars if I just said no, I decided to go ahead with the house.

During its construction (yes it was off the plan) she mentioned how she was getting locks installed on her bedroom. Before this point she wasn't going to have a bedroom (she lives in a house in another state). The bedroom that she claimed was the master bedroom, when this was going to be my first house and she was going to just visit sometimes. However she said she'd cover all the stamp duty, rates, etc. and I would just have to pay the bills and the mortgage, so I took it on the chin and moved on.

&amp;#x200B;

After the place was built I moved in, put my money into our shared offset account and she took my money out multiple times (sometimes as much as $10,000). When I confronted her she'd say she needed it to pay stamp duty as it cost more than she expected etc. but I made sure she gave it back as that's what we agreed initially, I still ended up paying more interest as the money was taken out of the offset though.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward again to the last month\~. She is going through some financial struggles and might need to sell the house. Honestly at this point I don't care about the house. I only accepted because it was proposed as a gift, and I have no issues with losing it (other than a slight emotional attachment to it at this point). However my family is telling me that, should we sell the place, the money I would get back is the mortgage I've paid minus rent. I think this is unfair. Someone doesn't pay rent when they own a house, that's the point of owning it. They tell me that if I had not lived in the house I would have had to have paid rent elsewhere, but I was scraping by the entire time, because owning is different to renting.

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to a close friend (40\~m) who owns a lot of property and he said that even the initial deal of me paying mortgage on a house my mum paid the deposit on was an amazing deal for her as I would essentially be paying twice the amount she did over the course of the mortgage, and to come out ahead the house's value would have to go up by more than twice my interest payments.

Technically I am a 50% owner in the house, so if we did sell it I could fight for half of the profit. I wouldn't do that, however if it's not right that I'm expected to pay rent then I would consider using that fact as a bargaining chip if need be.

I don't care about money that much, however the idea that I was lied to and mistreated across the board with this house, and that the entire reason we have to sell it is because of my mum's financial issues, I feel as though it's not fair to punish me financially.

Question time:

1. Is it right that I should be paying rent?

&amp;#x200B;

If the answer to the above question is no:

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;She absolutely does not want the Delaware County house. It is in the middle of nowhere in Upstate New York and she cannot drive. So, the house is basically an albatross hanging around my mother&amp;#39;s neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ETA: They made multiple attempts over the years to sell the house but were never able to unload it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the best possible way to remove this burden from my mother?&lt;/p&gt;

**tl:dr:** My ObGyn's inaction occurred ~10 years ago. It doesn't impact me now, but I am still upset.  I don't remember her name. How do I find her name? Can I still report the doctor?  How or to whom?  Washington, DC


**Background:**  Sometime in 2005-2007, I had sex in which my Boyfriend's condom broke.  It was Friday or Saturday night.  I called my ObGyn's emergency line to ask the On-Call ObGyn to send a prescription for Plan B to the Pharmacy.  I called the Emergency line a few times, and the representative said they contacted the On-Call ObGyn.  But the On-Call ObGyn never called me, and I never got Plan B. [The On Call ObGyn was *not* my original ObGyn.] 


I panicked because Plan B needs to be taken within the first 72 hours to be effective.  I became pregnant.  My original ObGyn referred me to a different doctor who did a DNC. The surgery was quick and painless.   I never told my original ObGyn because I was so focused on the pregnancy/DNC.  


However, over 10 years later, I am still angry at that On- Call ObGyn.  She's the reason that I even needed the DNC.  I don't remember her name, but I vaguely remember what she looked like.  I have changed insurance firms, I don't remember my original ObyGyn.  


**How do I even find her name?  Can I report her? Where do to report her?  I want her to be punished.  I do not have evidence that I called the Emergency line and she never helped me.**


**EDIT:**  During the pregnancy or soon after, I ran into the On-Call ObGyn.  I informed her who I was, and she looked away when she remembered (that she didn't reply to my emergency call).  Hence I feel it was intentional and not a mistake.


PS. I'm doing ok in my life right now.  


PPS. It sounds like it's too late for anything to happen - EVEN if something could be done.  Please post a comment if you feel otherwise.  Thank you for letting me know.

But I don&amp;#39;t know if that affects the census test which I did at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my question basically is, does this mean anything? The answer may just be no, but I wanted to ask. I mean, if for example, the citizenship question is struck down, does that mean my answer is invalid, or does it mean that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have received that test in the first place, or is the census test just a totally different thing that has its own set of rules..?&lt;/p&gt;

I moved to the table behind me and the shop was empty other than me and the person I was chatting with. My bag was at the original table, 3 feet away.

I got upset and asked why the manager moved my bag and he said he didn't know it was mine and it was his job to put it on the table.

What are my legal rights should the computer be water damaged? Can I ask the coffee shop's insurance to cover the cost of fixing it? I don't need a new computer, I just need something similar that's able to do video editing/rendering. Any advice would be appreciated!!! Thanks!

What happened was that I went out with a couple of friends and my friend's boyfriend to celebrate the end of finals. Let's call my friend Deb, her boyfriend Ulises, and my other friend Ivan (bc I feel like I shouldn't mention their real names lol). On the way home from LA, Ulises had a few sips of alcohol. Ulises was driving us all home with Deb sitting at the passenger's seat, me behind her, and Ivan next to me (and behind the driver). Though he gassed up the vehicle quite a bit, I wasn't too worried. I trusted him. Pretty soon we went on to reach 120, then 124 (we told him to slow down but I think he took it jokingly), 127, and 128 where we almost collided with another car on the right lane next to us while trying to stick to the freeway's curve (the freeway had a left bend after a few miles of straight road). To avoid hitting the car, Ulises swerved the wheel to the left and we instead rammed the freeway barrier because we were going too fast to make the turn/curve. We spun out for a good while and kept on hitting the barrier with every spin- I honestly thought I was going to die. Thankfully, we didn't hit any other cars and vice versa. After coming to, we decided to get off the freeway and made a quick pullover on the side of the freeway exit to get our bearings straight and just recuperate for a bit. Ulises was okay, Deb had broken some part of her hand and her ankle was swollen, Ivan got really bad whiplash and lost his vision for a good few minutes, and I had seatbelt burn along my neck and waist (since I was sitting at a weird position when the accident occurred). My neck was choked out as a result of the position I was at when I was being jostled around- I was facing the left side door so the majority of my pains come from my right side. A few moments later, some sheriffs rolled by and got our statements and what not. Ulises was breathalyzed and was issued a DUI. He and his family are currently trying to get it scrubbed off and we'll find out the outcome of his case within a few days. The sheriffs got our names and took the report. My other friend picked us all up and took us to his place while Ulises was taken to jail. The car was totaled, so driving home ourselves wasn't really an option. 

The days following the accident, Ulises kept on reassuring me that his father would be down to cover all of my medical bills so long as I don't litigate his son. My family felt bad about requesting money like that, but we really aren't in the position to be so lax with our financials at the moment. I went to a doctor a couple of times, got scans taken for my injuries, and am now seeing a chiropractor. I figured that I should just compile the bills into one single bunch before sending them off to Ulises (hence why I didn't just send him receipt after receipt immediately after receiving them). After days and weeks of apologies, reassuring me that his family would help take care of my bills and telling me not to feel bad about receiving the help, he messaged me one night to tell me that his father wasn't down to help me with my bills anymore. I had never sent him a receipt prior to that. I was shocked and didn't expect him to pull out just like that after already having made promises that he'd help me. I talked with Deb for a bit to try to see what was going on with the change of heart coming from Ulises' family. She told me that his mother thinks that I'm faking my injuries to get money from them and that his father doesn't take me seriously anymore because I didn't litigate Ulises. It hurt very much to hear that since I never had intentions to extort money from Ulises and his family by suing him for the accident. At this point, I can't really afford to pay off my bills on my own and would like his family to stick by the offer that they put out. I kind of feel like I had a carpet pulled right out from under me. Deb told me, however, that should I sue Ulises, our friendship would be finished. I did not expect that one bit and was surprised. Ulises has told her that he intends on helping me out after he gets a job -he's a nice guy and willing to take responsibility for what happened- but I don't think he's in the position to be able to afford to help me out with my bills alone without his parents' aid. Deb has told him that as well. I'm not sure what to do at this point or what my options even are. My chiropractor doesn't know how long it'll take me to finish therapy (could be months), so I won't have a definite amount for those bills. Could I sue to just have Ulises' parents stick to their word of helping with my medical bills? Could I get them to sign an agreement saying that they'd pay for my treatment until completion?

So this tale begins about 2.5 years ago. I approached a widely and highly recommended local engine builder (EB) about having a new performance motor built for my car. After a couple discussions we settled on a plan.

I pay $3800 upfront for the new motor and then over the next several months I pay EB a few hundred at a time, and every transaction was logged and signed on the same piece of paper as a handwritten receipt. The description of goods is simply titled ""engine work.""

Knowing that I'm paying in installments I'm not expecting anything to happen overnight, as there are several steps in the process like sending the block off to a machine shop to get prepped for the new internal parts. I check in periodically, usually getting a minimal update or ""waiting on ___ to contact me back about X part."" No big cause for concern for the first several months, after all I'm still making payments. 

About 6 months after the first lump sum the engine builder tells me my block is being sent to XXX engine shop for prep work. 

Well, ~12 months after the first payment EB says my block was at YYY engine shop that closed down a couple months ago, and the foreman there was resentful about something the company did and took all the remaining motors in the shop to sell off for himself. 

Now, EB apologized profusely about the whole thing and stated that he was pursuing the foreman legally to make everything right and pursue all his clients' stuff. He says it won't be a quick process, but he is very insistent that he will make things right. I naively take him at his word.

Well, another six months or so pass and still nothing. No parts, no refund, no means to rectify the situation. When I ask him to explain everything, EB tells me that the foreman has disappeared and he will just have to fix things himself.

I do realize that I should have definitely acted sooner, I feel like I've been gaslighted about the whole thing. Everyone I've spoken to seems shocked that I've had any problems at all with EB.


So this is where I'm at today:
I've got a handwritten and signed ""receipt"" with payments totaling $6300 (all payments have been in cash at his request), and 25 months of waiting for a motor that I saw when I bought it, but has since disappeared.

They don't use reddit much so they don't want to make the post, but they asked me to post about it for advice. This whole situation is one big cluster fuck, so please be patient with me about organization. I'm going to mostly stick to my boyfriend's story because that's the one I've been going through right along with him, and it's also the most extreme. Also, sorry if formatting is weird, I'm on mobile. 

TL:DR at the bottom!!! 

So like I said, he works for the local park district here as a lifeguard and has for 3 years in a row now. He started work this year at the end of May, and before his first day he did all of the required refresh training and paperwork, which if he had not done it would've prevented him from being payed. The paperwork is time stamped online at the time of submission, and his is dated May 11. The cutoff day was May 16. This paperwork is important because it basically allows them to pay you through their payroll system, and allows you to clock in at work. It consists of many forms, such as federal tax documents. 

The first sign of something being wrong was that he couldn't clock in at work on the first day. They didn't fix this for 3 or 4 weeks, and during that time the scheduling manager said that she would keep track of his hours, but he recently learned that she only kept track of the time he was scheduled for and did not include if he came in early or had to stay later after close (the guards are also required to clean the entire pool area and complex, including the changing areas and bathrooms).

Payroll is bi-weekly, and when he didn't get paid during the first pay period, he spoke to the Aquatics coordinator (who is above his direct supervisors) and he told him not to worry, that he would get paid next pay period and it would include his back pay. That was 5 weeks ago. When he didn't get paid during the next period, they told him the reasoning for not getting paid was that he hadn't brought in a physical copy of his SSN card. This is true, but he didn't do it because he was told not to, because they already had it on file since he had worked there the previous 2 years. He then went into the office itself and handed them his SSN and Birth Certificate just in case, and was told they would try to get him paid that Friday. Of course, that didn't happen.

A few days later, when Friday had passed and he hadn't gotten paid, he went in to talk to the Head Financial Coordinator, and was basically told it wasn't his problem, it was the lady who took his info that had done wrong. He told him that she hadn't submitted the documents until Friday, but that he wouldn't have gotten paid anyway because payroll wasn't until next Friday. He submitted these documents on Tuesday (it would've been Monday but she was out of the office and no one else could take them, apparently). He has since talked to several other people in the park district and has been met with people playing the blame game and just deflecting as much as possible.

The last straw was when he picked up his paystub today. It says he was only payed for 76.5 hours. He has most definitely worked way more than that these past 6 weeks, considering he works there full time. When he tried to speak with the Aquatics coordinator again, he said that they don't pay overtime or backpay, so he now has to wait for them  to add a bit more of his unpaid hours to the next several payrolls until it's all paid. On top of that, they are paying him the wrong hourly wage. Returning guards get an extra 10¢ for every year they return, unless they preformed badly the last year. They do little report cards to keep track of this. Based on his previous reports, his pay should be $9.70. When they finally paid him today, his pay was listed as $9.50. It's also worth noting that the Aquatics coordinator himself guaranteed that he would be paid his full due amount - overtime, backpay, and all. 

This can't possibly be legal, right? This had happened to several other lifeguards that work there, especially the part about not paying overtime until they can squeeze it into the next pay period as regular hours. One of the guards is trying to get enough evidence together (time worked vs hours paid, emails and texts that were sent between managers and office workers talking about the pay and what would be done, ect) to build a case to sue, but isn't there something else that can be done? Isn't there some department we can call to report this to?? 

Side note - Many of the managers and office working involved have just been playing the blame game and telling the guards that it isn't their problem or their fault, or saying one thing to them and promising to get it fixed, then later talking down to them saying that they said no such thing previously. Some of this has been documented, but at least half of it was in person. The Aquatics manager himself has gone back on things he said or promised multiple times, even calling my boyfriend a liar to another guards face when they brought it up as an example of what was also happening to them. He said that he hadn't submitted his paperwork on time, but that paperwork was time stamped, like I mentioned above. The Aquatics coordinator also said that if any parents contacted him or tried to get involved, that emoployee would be terminated (even if they are a minor, which several of our guard friends are). 

Any advice would be much appreciated!

I recently came back to work from maternity leave. I work at a company that supports women. I was expecting lots of support during my transition as a result of this, but I was surprised to get none.  Back story, I was scheduled to have my baby at 37 weeks. During my 35th week, I ended up having an emergency c-section.  

2 days after the birth, I received a text message from my boss asking me to complete a task and another text 3 hours later telling me it hadn't been complete.  I received a total of 7 text messages from her during my leave directly related to work tasks, some of which I needed to take action on.  

My temp  was also very direct in asking me to do things on my leave.  I received 4 text messages from her blatantly asking me to complete tasks. One if these tasks was a week before my return to work and I asked if it could wait. I never got a response. When I told my boss about the interaction upon my return she told me ""well that was actually time sensitive"".  

I will note that I complied with most of these requests, even going into the office once to get something off my computer for them. 

A week before I went back, we got on a call to talk about my transition back to the office.  She did not ask about me, but went on for 20 minutes about all the work that needs to be done when I return.  I emailed her a couple days later saying that I was overwhelmed and nervous after our conversation and if we could discuss the urgency of these tasks when I return to the office.  She followed up talking about everything that I would be doing without acknowledging my concerns and sent 2 more work related emails to my personal email before I returned. 

When I arrived to the office, she told me about everything that happened while I was gone and how hard it was on her.  She also did not ask me about my baby or leave and if I would be pumping, and what accommodations I would need to do so. 

I feel very surprised by this conduct given her stances on the support of mothers in our field.  I have decided to proceed with an informal process through our equal opportunity and access department where they will bring her in for a conversation about what I experienced, but there will be no investigation and no action will be taken. I am starting to wonder if this is bigger than that though. 

As an aside, I also found when I returned that she sent an announcement of my baby's birth and a photo of the baby to our department listerv which goes out to over 5000 people without my consent.

We had a dog from birth until she was about a year old. She was a bit rambunctious with my young kids, so I gave her away to a what I thought was a good home.

Three years passed and I got a call from the vet. Someone found her as a stray. She was microchipped, and still under my name. She was severely malnourished and missing big patches of her fur.

We washed and fed her, and she remembered us and was happy to be off the streets.

The woman that found her was contacted by the other owners who realized she was found. They got our phone number and called wanting us to return her.

The thing is, I don't want to return her. She was close to death, and miles from her adopted home. I don't want that to ever happen to her again.

I was immediately shooed out of the parking lot before I could get out and share info, and I'm worried this'll count as a hit and run. 

Okay, so yesterday I shared a story immediately after the incident occurred. I'll link it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c8heui/ca\_car\_bump\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c8heui/ca_car_bump_help/) 

Initially, I thought I had everything, but I kept rolling over the incident in my head and I think it might've not been the whole story. So here it is, as best I can recount: 

I was waiting in a waiting room after sending my family's car in for routine repairs. 

After paying and leaving, I got into the car. 

I tried to reverse out, but I was doing it very incrementally (the car is an SUV and the lot was very small.) 

as I was pulling out, some mechanics came over and started directing me out. I tried to follow their directions as best I could. 

Suddenly, while I was going forward, the mechanics shouted at me to stop. A split second later, I bumped into a parked car. I immediately went into reverse and stayed on the lot as I tried to see what I hit. 

A mechanic immediately came over, told me to roll down my window, and asked me if I knew how to drive. He also threatened to call the police, asked me if I knew what they could do to me, and said they could take away my license. 

I argued back that I did know how to drive, and that this car was unfamiliar to me. 

Meanwhile, another man, who at the time I was assuming was the driver, looked over and immediately offered to pay for the damages. I assumed he was the driver because of this. I apologized to him, he said it was no problem. 

He ran over to the vehicle. I did not see what he was doing, but the other mechanic who was shouting at me looked over at someone who I presume was the other man and nodded. He immediately told me to ""go."" Until then, he was still arguing me and threatening me with a police call.  

The thought had crossed my mind that I should leave a note, however, since the man who I was assuming was the driver had given me the go ahead to leave. 

While I was driving away, I saw the man who I thought was the driver wiping down the bumper of the car. The car I was driving was very dirty, and alot of the white marks on the bumper of the parked car came off. I did not manage to see if all of it came off though. 

My concern are twofold: 

1) I'm not sure if the man really was the driver or not. He was not in a mechanic's uniform, but I do find it odd that he was right there and offering to pay if he really was a driver. Just too much of a coincedence. Is he a manager? 

2) This was a fairly busy part of town, and I was worried that people might've seen and cited me. However, I was still being directed by mechanics and I did not immediately speed off, and I was still communicating with people while this was all happening, so I was wondering if that still counts as a hit and run. 

Thoughts? I don't want to get a threatening voicemail a few weeks from now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: I think I dinged a car while being following the directions of a mechanic who was directing me out of the parking lot of a body shop. I was immediately shooed out of the parking lot before I could get out and share info, and I&amp;#39;m worried this&amp;#39;ll count as a hit and run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so yesterday I shared a story immediately after the incident occurred. I&amp;#39;ll link it here:  &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c8heui/ca_car_bump_help/""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c8heui/ca_car_bump_help/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I thought I had everything, but I kept rolling over the incident in my head and I think it might&amp;#39;ve not been the whole story. So here it is, as best I can recount: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was waiting in a waiting room after sending my family&amp;#39;s car in for routine repairs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After paying and leaving, I got into the car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to reverse out, but I was doing it very incrementally (the car is an SUV and the lot was very small.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as I was pulling out, some mechanics came over and started directing me out. I tried to follow their directions as best I could. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, while I was going forward, the mechanics shouted at me to stop. A split second later, I bumped into a parked car. I immediately went into reverse and stayed on the lot as I tried to see what I hit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mechanic immediately came over, told me to roll down my window, and asked me if I knew how to drive. He also threatened to call the police, asked me if I knew what they could do to me, and said they could take away my license. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, another man, who at the time I was assuming was the driver, looked over and immediately offered to pay for the damages. I assumed he was the driver because of this. I apologized to him, he said it was no problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ran over to the vehicle. I did not see what he was doing, but the other mechanic who was shouting at me looked over at someone who I presume was the other man and nodded.

I was eating lunch during school and I had an odd feeling that something bad was gunna happen to me, then I started getting really scared (one of the symptoms of anaphylactic shock) as I threw out my lunch I started feeling weak and my mouth went numb and I was getting mild hives.

I asked my friend to take me to the nurse and she explained what happened. The nurse obviously knew what was wrong and I asked her to give me an epi pen injection. She said she couldn’t because I didn’t have the right paperwork

I was visibly angered but I also started to have trouble breathing. The nurse told me to sit down while I cried in the seat. She kept saying that it’s my fault that she can’t give me the epi pen. My schools security guard (who is absolutely amazing) went to my locker and got my own epi pen out of my backpack and have it to me. The nurse yelled at me and told me not to take it.

She called my parents, my mom didn’t pick up for awhile and my dad was on a plane so he couldn’t get me. After about an hour I called my mom again and she finally answered. The nurse explained to her what happened so my mom kept her cool for awhile. When we got home she went on a rant about how childish the nurses were and how I could have died.

Fast forward to today. I went to my doctor and I told him the story. He said that there was no harm in giving me the epi pen even if I didn’t need it. And it is against the law to not give someone the epi pen when they need it. Paperwork or no paperwork.

I’ve always hated the school nurses but I didn’t think it was that serious. We even have a rule at my school where there is no phones at all. So when I texted my mom about it they confiscated my phone until my mom came.

What do you guys think? Should’ve the nurse given it to me or just wait it out like she did? All comments are welcome. Thank you for reading


EDIT: I failed to mention that this incident happened in my second year of going to that school, so the previous all the needed paperwork was filled out, telling the administration that I was fully capable of getting the epi pen when needed.

I’m at a loss as to try to figure out what the fuck to do, I’m broke and alone with a toddler and beyond my heartbreak, I’m trying to figure out legal issues now. I will tell you my story, please be kind, as I am a highly sensitive person, and I know that what has become of my life is possibly due to my ignorance. you don’t have to tell me that I “could have, should have or would have” I get it, I also created this mess simply by being naive to my first love, a manipulative, narcissistic, sociopath. My first love was given to someone who is an abuser. Yes I know this, yes I have a therapist, yes I will heal. But I need legal advice not moral. 

I met and fell in love with a Man who undocumented, he came to the country legally through a student visa, and then stayed past his student visa about 7/8 years the day we met. He told me of his troubles. I decided after 7 months of dating that it would be in his best interest to get married, to keep him safe and get his documents figured out. We were completely in love, it wasn’t a facade. Three months after marriage, I became pregnant. We had an immigration lawyer in our town willing to take the case as we were married and with child. Somehow, my husband decided it was too stressful to file the papers, and withheld from filing, even though we had payed an attorney and everything was getting situated legally, while I was pregnant. My whole pregnancy he decided different reasons as to why it was a bad idea to file. He took control of all the legal discussions, and documents leaving me in the dark about what was happening. On the side, he was out partying and not coming home multiple times, left for a festival and didn’t come back until four days later than the day he was supposed to with no contact. I was 7 months pregnant. 

Before the baby came i pleaded with him to file, but he refused. Then trump got elected and that was his fuel to excuse not filing, my whole entire child’s life to this point. He has partied and had two affairs since my child has been born, and the last affair, with his coworker, he left me for. (He works in an office where he is an “in house independent contractor” but they don’t like this idea and have threatened to fire him if he doesn’t get on payroll.) His checks are going into an account with my social security. Has not claimed any of his income (60k a year) for 3/4 years. 

Since the last affair he had, he left me for another woman. I am heartbroken and also totally lost as to how to divorce him without deporting  him or bringing him to court. 

I want full or sole custody of my child as since the separation, he has partied and slept at the other woman’s house every night. He is unfit to be a parent and clearly incapable of holding any responsibility. 

How do I divorce an undocumented person, while we have a child together? How do I get full or sole custody without having to take him to court, as he is without a social security number or anything providing proof he is a legal resident in the US? How can I do this in a civil way without jeopardizing my sons father so I don’t create a future resentment with my son? I’m so heartbroken and lost and utterly incapable emotionally and not to mention broke. Please help me. My son is the most amazing child in my universe. I want to protect his heart and spirit. I want to make sure that I can have him completely so that he is not taken at all by his abusive sick father. Please help me. 

TLDR:need to divorce a man I married who was undocumented, we have a small child, I want full or sole custody of child, want to divorce husband and get custody outside of court and figure out how to remove him from his income being claimed in my social security through bank account.

Hi everyone

My 2 children (1 and 3) attend childcare 3 days a week while I work.

I want to move them somewhere else after a few incidents (youngest was left to play with cat poo, wtf?).

When we enrolled we were sent a family handbook. This handbook said 2 weeks' notice for cancellation was required. I still have this document.  Now all of their documents say 4 weeks' notice required.  This has been updated sometime online, but we were not given notice of the change.

Is this 4 weeks' still enforcable?  I understand documents may have a ""subject to change"" type clause but I would have thought actively communicating changes would be required.

Apparently head office can agree to reduced notice so I have contacted them explaining we simply don't trust the care anymore but so far no reply.  In the meantime, I am dropping the children off later when I have more confidence in the carers but I can't do that after next week.

Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: Location is Brisbane, Australia&lt;/p&gt;

I also have a best friend who has uncontrollably support for my due to her witnessing what happens in my household and not liking ot one bit. 

So here's my question.

What proof do I need to get custody of my brother? 

For 1 thing I'm the primary caretaker of my brother since I was 11. They did trying try find a baby sitter, but that didn't even least half a week. When they dumped their children on my I had barely any experience and I was stressed and house keep AND school AND babysitting at the same time.

I know what most of you are thinking. How could you?? Well here's a thing, my mother is a Karen and my father is a narcissist. Here's I few things just to show you how unhealthy the environment is in this household.

My mother has shown me multiple times of how much she cares for my little brother. For instance I was in the mall and me and my bestfriend was allowed to have an hour of freedom. As a teenager usually this is only or they don't need the hour because they have free rome, but for me this was a once in a lifetime experience for me. I was REALLY  Hesitant though because my little brother was not going to be under my watchful eyes, but from my mother eyes. So I went off with my friend reassuring me that my little brother was going to be okay. 

Then we came back after our time of freedom was done and we seen. My mother sitting in a chair, eyes glued to her phone and no Adrian (fake name) in sight. My heart sunken not seeing my brother anymore. 4 years old and no where to be seen. Then she asked  me to go find him as the was playing her game.

I. Was. Furious.

But I couldn't show that to my mother but I'm a child and I dont know anything, besides she would put it under as attitude like she thinks my anxiety with conflict and my out burst of tears are 'attitude'. Almost half an hour passed ONLY of me and my bestfriend while my mother was playing on her phone you know why I know she was playing on she phone. Why is she playing farmville music and flicking her finger on her phone for. Watching her screen as she harvest her crops and feeds the cows. We found Adrian in the food court FAR from where my mother was sitting at, bothering people for food because he was hungry. 

I never let her watch Adrian again unless his under my watch as well. 

Not to mention what she does to me. She degrades things I like to watch and has controlled my career path. For example I like anime shows or  Ghibli movies. Ponyo ""Stop watching that shit it's so retarded I can't believe you'd watch something so garbage"" assassination classroom ""my oh God turn this shit off that has no story line I can't believe you want to watch this"" and so on and so on. I drop alot of this I loved just to make her shut up. Even a guy i actually loved and he love me back it was a wholesome relationship to but she thought he was to good for me and need someone who was actually on his level. 

I agreed.

For years I have been suffering through depression and anxiety because of her and her  shenanigans. She jumps at anyone who doesn't do want she wants them to do. Oh and your not allowed to bully my child that's my job.

I vented a few times to friends and they would tell her what I said. So I would get grounded and threatened to be put in a group home and they scare me talking about how people in the foster care system get raped and if I dont do what they tell me to I'll be put there and get raped.

My dad is another problem I was 9 when I met him. He was nice and love for the most part. Then my mother started training him to hate me. Everything I do was attitude and when I do something wrong bt accident my punishment is to be yelled in the face which would make me cry and get my phone taken away because I'm a crybaby. I'm under the rules of ""I'm right your wrong deal with it"" and ""your just a child you can't dont anything unless we tell you to do that and you better do it correctly this time"". 

Over all I just want my brother to live a happier life than I did. That means take him away when I turn 18 and had a stable income, stable life, and a stable home. My bestfriend is willing to help me get to that point so that we can be able to let my brother grow and not walk on eggshells like I'm having to do. I'm becoming a nurse so at 16 (in a year) I'll become a nurse  Assistant so I can get income AND if I'm good enough for the job I'll get a free scholarship when I graduate from highschool and go to a nursing university.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I post this issue on &lt;a href=""/r/relationshipadvice""&gt;r/relationshipadvice&lt;/a&gt; but I only got 2 comments (I&amp;#39;m new) and both were  Contradicting eachother.

&lt;p&gt;I agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years I have been suffering through depression and anxiety because of her and her  shenanigans. She jumps at anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t do want she wants them to do. Oh and your not allowed to bully my child that&amp;#39;s my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vented a few times to friends and they would tell her what I said. So I would get grounded and threatened to be put in a group home and they scare me talking about how people in the foster care system get raped and if I dont do what they tell me to I&amp;#39;ll be put there and get raped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad is another problem I was 9 when I met him. He was nice and love for the most part. Then my mother started training him to hate me. Everything I do was attitude and when I do something wrong bt accident my punishment is to be yelled in the face which would make me cry and get my phone taken away because I&amp;#39;m a crybaby. I&amp;#39;m under the rules of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m right your wrong deal with it&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;your just a child you can&amp;#39;t dont anything unless we tell you to do that and you better do it correctly this time&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over all I just want my brother to live a happier life than I did. That means take him away when I turn 18 and had a stable income, stable life, and a stable home. My bestfriend is willing to help me get to that point so that we can be able to let my brother grow and not walk on eggshells like I&amp;#39;m having to do. I&amp;#39;m becoming a nurse so at 16 (in a year) I&amp;#39;ll become a nurse  Assistant so I can get income AND if I&amp;#39;m good enough for the job I&amp;#39;ll get a free scholarship when I graduate from highschool and go to a nursing university.&lt;/p&gt;

It has affected me over the years but I didn’t think I could do much about it. However, 2 months ago I ran into the person who committed the assault and he asked, “If I remember passing out at his place?” 

To provide some details, this happened at college. We had all been drinking and I passed out on the coach. A person I was acquainted with “tea-bagged” me while his friends took pictures. I do not have access to these original pictures. 

After his question, I turned the video of my phone on and asked him point blank if that’s what he was referring to. I did so discretely, which to my knowledge is legal in MI. I asked him if he tea bagged me and he said yes. I was quite angry and continued to ask him about the situation. He went on to explain that I shouldn’t feel bad as he did it to a bunch of others and then named other people we both knew. 

I have all of this on video. He admitted to tea-bagging, and taking pictures because he thought it was humorous at the time. I know this is seen as ok in some frat-type cultures. But it affected and continues to affect me and I’d like to do something about it.

I posted this all in another post maybe a week ago, but no one helped us out. Please, we are desperate for advice.

Our previous insurance through my husbands old employer was continued through COBRA when he left the company. At the time, they said it would be $1900 a month to continue it. My husband opted to call them and cancel it because we could get AppleCare through our state if we had no income. State is WA. When we called them, they stated that we would instead pay $467 a month to continue the insurance. My husband, deciding that we could afford that, opted to stick with the insurance he had through his previous employer.

The insurance ended when my husband found a new job, but they sent us a check in the mail for almost $2000 with no explanation. Soon after, we began receiving bills from all of our doctors saying that the insurance is getting their money back. We called them (HR) and discovered they “accidentally” had our insurance revoked. They began work on restoring it so that it covered those appts, and we called the doctors telling them to resubmit the claims, because we were insured during those months. 

Seems like everything is being resolved, until we get a bill from husbands old employer’s HR for $11,000. Again, with no explanation. My husband calls them and they say we owe them for COBRA. In the most recent phone call they told him that we could either pay them, or they could revoke the insurance and we could pay the full amount of our doctor bills.

Please do not tell me we were on the hook for the full amount of the insurance ($1900). I am aware now that we should have been. At the time we tried to cancel, they reassured us that we did NOT need to pay that amount, but rather the amount of his employee contribution. They told my husband on the most recent phone call that they made a mistake in filing his termination paperwork, resulting in this mix up. They charged us $467 a month during the time he was unemployed, not $1900. We would have never agreed to that, as I said above, we would have switched to AppleCare. 

I want to know what our options are here. Is there a type of lawyer that deals with this sort of thing? Do we have a case if they have made at least two major mistakes in this whole thing? This feels like throwing $11,000 down the drain when we would have paid $0 for AppleCare.

How should a deposit be returned on a lease with multiple tenants when I am the one who initially sent the deposit money in the first place? I signed a lease with two women. Long story short, they were both horrible housemates who were dirty, destructive and didn't contribute to the household in a positive manner.

One of them had a dog who peed in my room and she didn't offer to clean it up (or even apologize), so I had to shampoo the carpets in my room. Also, she broke my cooking utensils without offering to replace or repay me the value of the utensils. She managed to split in half a bamboo cutting board I had purchased and simply left it sitting on the counter in pieces. She left unpaid bills that I simply didn't reach out to her about because (a) she was absolutely insane and difficult to deal with and (b) I had figured I would simply take it out of her deposit and send her the remainder.

The other destroyed my furniture and left unpaid bills. Both of them have numerous things I think should be deducted from their deposit, but my landlord is hesitant to return the deposit to me despite the fact that I sent him the deposit amount to begin with.

Now, I did let my landlord (who I have been renting from for 3 years now) know that I was having issues with my housemates and that it wasn't a particularly good fit. This was a precautionary measure because one of them actually wanted to stay again next year and renew the lease which I absolutely was not going to allow.

Now, that our lease is coming to an end and I am beginning to wonder how our deposit will be returned to us, my landlord is hesitant about returning the deposit to me despite the fact that I am the one who sent him the deposit to begin with. In my mind, if I sent you the money, then it would need to be returned to me so that I can deduct unpaid bills, broken furniture and labor costs from their shares of the deposit and return to them the remainder.

Our neighbor is the neighborhood bully - does what he wants, expects people to fall in line.  A couple of years ago, he put up these two enormous tents (temporary garages? - they’re soft sided heavy duty plastic/canvas on 4 sides) for all of his junk in his backyard, in direct view of our windows.  He assured us they were temporary.  This only becomes important because he started storing his boat in one of them, and has been flipping out about the possibility of branches falling from our trees onto them.  Last year, he told us we “had” to get the trees taken down.  We explained we wouldn’t be doing that - the trees are healthy, have survived many wind and snow storms, and provide a visual barrier between our yard and his giant junk tents.  He then hired a tree company to come give an estimate for removal and slipped it in our mailbox.  We again explained we weren’t doing it.  He came back and said his lawyer assured him he could cut down any branches on his side.  
  Since then, he’s been really aggressive about “trimming” branches on his side - basically sheared off half of a beautiful pine tree for no clear reason, etc.  Today was the final straw.  We came home to find workers on our side of the property fence, finishing cutting down the last of three trees that were CLEARLY on our side of the fence.  When we asked the workers what they were doing, they first said they didn’t know that was our side of the fence (which is a joke - they had to climb over the fence to get to our side) then admitted they had asked the neighbor and he gave them the okay to do it.

I’m furiously angry, and of course, neighbor is nowhere to be found.  As I see it, there are two issues:  
   1. He sent workers on to our property and destroyed our property.  Those trees were beautiful old mature trees.  They cannot be replaced.  I want him to be fined or something, and I still want him to somehow make this right - either paying for landscaping to provide the visual barrier again, or replanting trees that aren’t little saplings.  Do I have any recourse here?

2.  His “temporary” garages/tents have been up for years.  In my cursory reading of the local code, it looks like he should have had to get a permit to erect a structure that has been up this long.  How do I pursue code enforcement here, and does this affect any potential resolution for the tree issue?

We’re in Saratoga County, NY, FWIW.

UPDATE: Went to go take photos and measurements of the stumps left behind, and realized the workers had actually cut through the wire part of the fence and bent it back in order to access our property.  My husband, who is the least confrontational person on the planet, wants to try to resolve this “amicably” as we’ve been neighbors for many years, and will be neighbors for many years going forward.  I feel like any response we have - which I would like to be of a legal nature - is only in response to his bad acts, and we shouldn’t feel bad at all.  I have a list of civil attorneys in the area, and will be calling on Friday.  It sounds like my next step is to contact an arborist for an estimate of the cost of stump removal, and a landscaper for an estimate of the cost of replacement.

Our water is provided by Rockwood Water (rwpud) and our sewer/storm water is through the City of Portland. Recently our complex switched to submetering for our water/sewer/storm water bill. While I don't think I am being overcharged, there is something weird going on with our bills. My sewer usage is almost 3 times higher than my water usage. Everyone I have spoken to about this has told me that usually sewer/storm water is more expensive than water, but that is not what I mean. The sewer/storm water \*usage\* on my bill for June is 2,600 \*gallons\* more than my water usage. Based on \[this\]([https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/article/736214](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/article/736214)) page that explains how the city calculates sewer/storm water usage this does not seem right. I pointed this out to the head of the HOA over text and without even acknowledging my text she forwarded an email she had sent someone in the past stating that sewer is just more expensive than water because there are more line items. Attached was our water and sewer bills from October/November of 2018. On our sewer bill she had hand written that our sewer usage was based on the winter average. I don't  see anything weird about those bills, our water usage was around 140 ccf and sewer was 95 ccf for two months, which makes a lot more sense then the bills that the submetering company is sending us. I also noticed that there were a lot of additional line items and all of them aside from the actual water and sewer are either flat rate fees or based on the square footage of the building. My bill from the submetering company does not have these line items at all, the only line items on my bill are ""water"" and ""sewer and storm water"" which are calculated by multiplying my supposed ""usage"" by the submetering company's rate. The submetering company does not seem to be charging us the same rate that rwpud and Portland is charging the HOA. Rockwood Water's rate is currently about 0.00341$ per gallon and we are being charged 0.00655 per gallon. The City of Portland's current sewer rate is around 0.015$ per gallon and we are being charged 0.01$ per gallon. Both rwpud and Portland bill by the ccf so I had to convert the rates to gallons and some precision was lost, so bear with me.

What I think might be happening is that the submetering company is lumping all of the fixed rate charges in with our sewer bill and then using their rate and the amount that we should be charged to calculate what they should list as our sewer/storm water usage instead of doing it the other way around. I have spoken to the submetering company, but they haven't been overly helpful in explaining why the usage is listed as being so high aside from saying that the sewer bill is divided among us based on our water usage. This leads me to believe that the flat rate fees from our bill are divided based on our water usage as well. My water usage is pretty low so I think I am actually benefiting from this, but it does not seem fair that the units that use more water should have to pay a larger portion of a flat rate fee when their usage has no impact on how much that fee is. I'm also frustrated that there is so little transparency with the bill and what I am being charged for.

From my research online it looks like there are laws about submetering in tenant/landlord situations, but I haven't found anything that covers HOA/owner situations. I don't want my neighbors to be treated unfairly. I know that if I request a copies of the bills they will be required to give them to me, but I don't know if what they are doing is actually against the law and I don't want to anger them too much if there isn't anything I can actually do. I would just like the bill to show what we are being charged for and for the flat rate fees to be split evenly among the units.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I own/live in a condominium unit in Portland, OR.

After a few consultations, I was advised to gather up all my evidence and request a copy of damages and recipients, which I have yet to receive.

I filed an extension to answer while I gathered up evidenced and resources to acquire legal council. Tomorrow would be the deadline on my extension so I went down to the courthouse again, today, to file for a motion (due to it being my second extension). 

Checked online to see if it was approved and I discovered a file from the insurance company from June 25th. To sum it up the headline is “judgment entry tendered.”

Fast forward 3 years later and I am finally hitting 6 months seizure free and have had my diseases dealt with and hopefully fully figured out. I reached out to the same counselor that told me I had 5 years to come back to school to finish my last year, and she stated that the school classes have changed for the course and only 1 of my 10 classes can be used. I feel very blind sided as if the courses were to change, I would've figured out my best way to continue school the following year rather then waiting. I have taken out a student loan for this($14,000) and now none of my credits can be used or transfered to any other course in the school. I am sitting here frustrated because they are telling me no matter what I will owe the money for the classes that are no longer valid and if I want to return to school I will have to retake all the classes again.

The contract specifies what is to be done and that it is to be completed by 7/3.  Plumber boy says 'no problem' and signs the contract.  He did nothing on Friday,  Did some work on Monday... took Tuesday off to run errands and said it would be done and completed today.  I'm being patient as there is a contract.

He calls me today and says it's done except for one small thing (I'm willing to give him a pass on that).  So he leaves for a 4 days weekend.  I go by the townhome and I hear dripping.  I find the drip and it's not a little one.  I go out to the water shut off valve in the room outside and another leak is spraying water!  WTF.  Plus he didn't do 1/3 of the stuff listed in the contract to be done.

The contract expires in about 4 hours.   Every week that this takes is costing me about 250 bucks.  

Do I have any options here or am I just fucked?  I'm firing him at 12:01.  I have not paid him anything yet so I'm not sure what to do about money.  I'm going to have to hire another plumber to fix his work and finish what he was supposed to do.  Ideas on what the legal way is to handle this idiot?

My dad married my biological mom after two months of dating and had me along with two siblings. They stayed together for fourteen years before my dad divorced her over her alcoholism and abuse towards her children. The divorce was pretty messy because my dad didn't sign a prenup and my siblings and I ended up having to shuttle constantly between both parents. 

Now, two years after the divorce my dad hired a nanny to look after us and they began dating a few days after. (She's in her mid20's and my dad in his late 40's to give perspective.) After two months of dating, my dad has already been convinced by her to buy a bigger house and to buy a large engagement ring, the same thing that happened in his last marriage. I talked to him about it and he plans to get married without a prenup and I'm worried that he's just going to be used again and fall into the same trap, but he won't budge. Is there any legal way to prevent this marriage from happening as his child?

I'm also in the process of extricating myself from a toxic marriage in Utah, which I don't think my spouse is aware of, since I'd like to keep my profile low until I'm ready to take the plunge. (My therapist is working with me on this.) I haven't told him about the bonus.

It's not that I'm worried I'll eventually have to split this money with him--I know I probably will--but I'm terrified that he'll want to spend it all on a business that we've been talking about for a long time. (He wants badly to get it off the ground, but I'm backing off for obvious reasons.)

We keep separate accounts, so I could easily put the money away and keep quiet, EXCEPT that my brother is also getting this bonus. These two are good friends--brothers, practically--and they talk about everything. It's only a matter of time before my husband finds out. As I see it, I have three options:

1. Try to get ahead of this by telling my brother about the state of my marriage and asking him to keep this information on the DL. This might not work because my brother is closer with my husband than he is with me and I know he can't be trusted with this info. (It's complicated and working out this dynamic just isn't relevant or possible right now.)
2. Get out in the open about how I'm planning to leave--well before I'm ready--so that I don't have to spend this money on the business and we can just work out whatever split the law mandates.
3. Just go along with whatever so that I don't have to drop this bomb yet.

Like I said, the marriage isn't great, and just telling him that I don't want to start the business anymore won't get me far and will probably make things worse.

What am I going to do?

**\*\*TL;DR\*\***: I'm on the DL trying to leave my marriage, but an unexpected bonus is forcing me to either blow my cover or watch helplessly while my husband spends it on a future I don't think we have. Need advice on protecting this windfall without blowing up my life.

(My therapist is working with me on this.) I haven&amp;#39;t told him about the bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that I&amp;#39;m worried I&amp;#39;ll eventually have to split this money with him--I know I probably will--but I&amp;#39;m terrified that he&amp;#39;ll want to spend it all on a business that we&amp;#39;ve been talking about for a long time. (He wants badly to get it off the ground, but I&amp;#39;m backing off for obvious reasons.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We keep separate accounts, so I could easily put the money away and keep quiet, EXCEPT that my brother is also getting this bonus. These two are good friends--brothers, practically--and they talk about everything. It&amp;#39;s only a matter of time before my husband finds out. As I see it, I have three options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to get ahead of this by telling my brother about the state of my marriage and asking him to keep this information on the DL. This might not work because my brother is closer with my husband than he is with me and I know he can&amp;#39;t be trusted with this info. (It&amp;#39;s complicated and working out this dynamic just isn&amp;#39;t relevant or possible right now.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get out in the open about how I&amp;#39;m planning to leave--well before I&amp;#39;m ready--so that I don&amp;#39;t have to spend this money on the business and we can just work out whatever split the law mandates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just go along with whatever so that I don&amp;#39;t have to drop this bomb yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, the marriage isn&amp;#39;t great, and just telling him that I don&amp;#39;t want to start the business anymore won&amp;#39;t get me far and will probably make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I going to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**TL;DR*\&lt;/strong&gt;*: I&amp;#39;m on the DL trying to leave my marriage, but an unexpected bonus is forcing me to either blow my cover or watch helplessly while my husband spends it on a future I don&amp;#39;t think we have. Need advice on protecting this windfall without blowing up my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; I ended up learning that the amount was much, much lower than I was initially told, so I&amp;#39;m not worried about this any longer. Thanks, all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any normal kid that age is great. I would not care. This one is different. I feel as though it is known he should not be unsupervised and I don&amp;#39;t want to supervise him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I responsible by him by default when my in-laws (his legal guardians) simply leave without telling me that he will just be hanging out here unattended? If he does something awful could I somehow be found liable in any way? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple solution would be to just leave. That is not so easy. It is very hot and semi-rural where I live and we only have one car.&lt;/p&gt;

My ex-employer to refusing to pay my severance benefits. Here are the facts based on the handbook:

***Severance benefits: Earned vacation shall be cashed at your current hourly rate upon termination or separation.***  

There is no further explanation about the definition of termination nor separation. Handbook states I have earned 11 days, I used 5 of those days a few months ago, so I am down to 6 days remaining. 

I received my final paycheck yesterday &amp; the boss left a note in with my paycheck citing laws &amp; another part of the handbook. In the letter, the boss refers to the resignation that is in the handbook:

***If you want to resign, put your intention in writing &amp; submit it to the Manager two weeks before the intended last day of work.***

The boss cited these laws:

Wisc. Stat. 109.01 (03) In Wisconsin, employers are not required to provide employees with vacation benefits, either paid or unpaid. If an employer chooses to provide such benefits, **it must comply with the terms of its established policy or employment contract.** (Bold is what the boss highlighted)

An employer may also lawfully establish a policy or enter into a contract disqualifying employees from payment of accrued vacation upon separation from employment if they fail to comply with specific requirements, **such as giving two week notice** or being employed as a specific date of the year. See Tasker v. Chieftain Wildrice Company, 263 Wis.2d 432, 662 N.W.2d 679 (Ct. App. 2003) (Bold is what the boss highlighted)

FYI: I walked out, I quit. Paychecks are bouncing, the boss is doing illegal things &amp; the store used all the savings, so now there is no more backup. Paychecks are bouncing &amp; bills that the store pays for is bouncing. I needed to dedicate my time to finding another job that would be able to pay me &amp; be flexible with my college schedule. It doesn't state anywhere reasons for why I would be disqualified for getting my severance pay. It just states I receive them if terminated or separated. The whole handbook is pretty vague &amp; simple. I separated myself from the company &amp; based on the handbook, I should be able able to receive my severance.

Thoughts?

Questions: If I was to hire an employment lawyer, could I suggest that the employer pay my attorney's fees? I shouldn't have to pay for a lawyer to get what is mine.

My partner left as well, he has 10 days accrued that is also being not being paid. So it would be both of us against our ex-employer.

Apparently the cashier was very nice and not acting suspicious at all. My friend gave her Sephora card (has name, email, phone number) for the purchase. The cashier asked “would you like to buy the brand B eyeshadow?” (Different brand from what she actually took). She said “no, but thank you.” Then the cashier asked, “would you like to put it on hold?” And she replied “no thank you.” At this point my friend was confused because she did not have the eyeshadow that the cashier was referring to (albeit a different one). After the purchase went through, the cashier said “would you like a bag, or do you want to put it in the bag you put the brand B eyeshadow in?” And my friend said “I really don’t know what you’re talking about, but I’ll put it in my purse and save a bag. Thanks!”
My friend proceeded to walk out of the store (no towers went off). Another staff member yelled at her “alright give us the brand B eyeshadow back! Let me see your bag!” My friend stated that she did not have this item and it was illegal for them to search her (s. 8 of the Charter). They told her she could never come back. She left the mall and went home. 

My friend is in her early 20s and has no criminal record. She absolutely made a bad choice. I can’t explain why she did it, either. 

She is worried that the store will contact the police after the fact, and she will be charged, since she gave the store her information prior to accusation.

She is extremely anxious about being charged after the fact, despite not being on camera, not being spoken to by security, not being confronted by police and not admitting guilt. 

So in short, my question is: can the store use the personal information she gave and send it to the police to have the police locate and arrest her? 
On a less serious note, do they have the right to ‘ban’ someone from their store when there was NO guilt admitted/charge laid, only a strong accusation?

The apartment manager says that the heat isn’t a health hazard even though the temps in the apartment are well over the 90s. To keep safe I’ve bought my own window unit and some fans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threatened to not pay my rent (stupid I know) but it got them to put in two tiny window units. My AC still isn’t fixed and there’s other issues arising too. I didn’t receive my mailbox key for over a month and then was given a key for someone else’s mailbox that was clearly marked with their apartment number and not mine.... I want to break my lease with as little financial hit to me as possible but don’t know how. I already have a place lined up to move to fast if I need it and another place I want to move to. I just can’t afford to pay for two apartments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry this is rambley and long but I’m at my wits end here. Thanks in advance for any advice!&lt;/p&gt;

In a legal dilemma. :(

Ex and I of five years ended it. Well, she ended it. I tried to reconcile, but she ended that after a month.

We have a 3 year old together. I believe she is best fit to be with me. Here are the details:

Her: currently primary care giver. I have our daughter every Wednesday and every other weekend.

-Lives at home with mom
-Works part time out of choice (20 hours, 12 an hour maybe)
-Pulled her out of child care because she can’t afford half a month (I paid the other half) $320.
-Just got a new car her parents did the down payment for
- talked to child support person, claims she should be getting $400 a month, $900 when daughter goes back to child care 
-diagnosed with bipolar and depression
- working on special ed education degree, will have a school semester soon without pay 
- I agreed to let her claim our daughter on taxes 

Me: 
- work full time (40 hours at 16 an hour)
- have been paying half of daycare and now her $300 a month 
- involved dad, take daughter to swimming lessons on Wednesday’s, wants more time
- have a two bedroom apartment, she has her own room
- bachelors degree
- not diagnosed with anything 

What I would like is to get our roles reversed, have primary physical custody and get my daughter back in child care. Swap who claims her on taxes yearly, A minimum of 50-50, With her living with me.

I believe my daughter would be best served with me and I don’t have an intention of being her car payment.

I'll TL:DR here: Got sued, lost, they want more so they filed a Trial De Novo but never sent a demand letter. Can I ask for a Summery dismissal?


So I own an entertainment company and did a Bridal show with the company suing me in October of 2018. There were a ton of issues with the show, including us not getting the amount of space that we paid for. I paid for the show about 2 months before I ever signed the contract (which I didn't fill out fully either). Anyways, part of doing these bridal shows is that you get an email list supposedly of everyone that shows up to these shows or signs up to go. He guarantee's 550 leads in one of his ads. One of the terms of the contract that I signed (again way after paying) states ""THE MAILING LIST MAY NOT BE USED TO PROMOTE ANY BRIDAL OR HONEYMOON SHOW, SEMINAR, WORKSHOP, OR ANY TYPE OF EVENT THAT PROMOTES THE GATHERING OF FUTURE BRIDES AND/OR FUTURE GROOMS"" and that failure to follow will mean you have to pay $10,000 on demand. The issue is that in January I used an email list (I was positive it wasn't his, but his competitors and my own email list from my website) to send out an add for us at his competitors show. Somehow he got a copy of my ad and says it's because he put in fake emails into his list to catch people doing this. I've since found out in the last decade he's sued over 90 people doing this or other things. He also won't supply what email address's are fake so I can confirm they aren't on my other email lists. He sued me for $5000 in city court where I don't live or own my business.


Now I never received a demand letter for payment and he refused to call, email, or text me before suing me, and he never returned a call or email I sent him asking him what it was for. I say that because when he filed the lawsuit he put that it was for ""failure to pay for bridal show"". Now I'm not a lawyer (obviously) but I mentioned both of these items (the failure to send a demand letter as required by NYS and that he sued me for failure to pay when I have proof that I paid and he's bringing up other items) during arbitration but the arbitrator sided with him and awarded him $1000. I was ok with just paying the $1000 and putting it behind me and warning everyone to stay far away from him, but then I got a letter stating he is filing for Trail De Novo. I know that Vacates the decision from the Arbitrator and none of it can be used (which ugh).


So I have a few things I have questions about (and yes I asked my lawyer some things but I can't keep pestering him and paying him so much for simple questions :/);


First, can I file a motion for dismissal with prejudice since I signed as a corporation and he is suing me as an individual instead of the corporation, doesn't that pierce the veil of the corporation (S-Corp)?


Second, Can I file a motion for dismissal with prejudice since he never sent a demand letter as required for a business suing an individual? I keep all of my informed delivery emails and can show that if he filed that he sent it that he is most likely lying and lied under the oath of the form. 

Third, He needs to mail me the notice he wants to file a Trial De Novo before he actually files it. I noticed that it was re-opened before he sent the letter to me (we can see court cases online) which means he lied on the form for the trial de novo that he sent it before filing. Is there anything I can do in this case?

I know this is a lot, so I apologize for the wall of text. I honestly can't afford the $5,000 since I only do this as a side from my paramedic job and if he had reached out to me like a gentleman where we could settle this outside of court actions. I'm just very hurt and angry to dealing with someone so slimy.

Now I&amp;#39;m not a lawyer (obviously) but I mentioned both of these items (the failure to send a demand letter as required by NYS and that he sued me for failure to pay when I have proof that I paid and he&amp;#39;s bringing up other items) during arbitration but the arbitrator sided with him and awarded him $1000. I was ok with just paying the $1000 and putting it behind me and warning everyone to stay far away from him, but then I got a letter stating he is filing for Trail De Novo. I know that Vacates the decision from the Arbitrator and none of it can be used (which ugh).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have a few things I have questions about (and yes I asked my lawyer some things but I can&amp;#39;t keep pestering him and paying him so much for simple questions :/);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, can I file a motion for dismissal with prejudice since I signed as a corporation and he is suing me as an individual instead of the corporation, doesn&amp;#39;t that pierce the veil of the corporation (S-Corp)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Can I file a motion for dismissal with prejudice since he never sent a demand letter as required for a business suing an individual? I keep all of my informed delivery emails and can show that if he filed that he sent it that he is most likely lying and lied under the oath of the form. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, He needs to mail me the notice he wants to file a Trial De Novo before he actually files it. I noticed that it was re-opened before he sent the letter to me (we can see court cases online) which means he lied on the form for the trial de novo that he sent it before filing. Is there anything I can do in this case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is a lot, so I apologize for the wall of text. I honestly can&amp;#39;t afford the $5,000 since I only do this as a side from my paramedic job and if he had reached out to me like a gentleman where we could settle this outside of court actions. I&amp;#39;m just very hurt and angry to dealing with someone so slimy. Thanks everyone for your help.&lt;/p&gt;

My ex girlfriend and I are still living together right now in a house where I pay rent, 100% of the utility bills and buy most of the food.  Due to some complications revolving around her marriage status when my son was born (she was not divorced from her ex husband), my name is not on his birth certificate yet.  We broke up back in Feb, but she refuses to leave the house to me, so I will be moving out into my own place in a few months.  She doesn't pay rent (never really has), never paid the bills, and sometimes buys groceries/diapers.

She has threatened in the past that she would try to sue me for past child support (back to Feb) but wouldn't me *actually supporting* my son count as child support?  How would/should I show the court that I've been supporting her and my son financially for years?

Also, as a side note (and believe me I know how stupid it sounds of me to be considering this but) she wants me to continue paying the rent after I've moved out *in lieu* of official child support payments because she doesn't want our landlord to force her to sign a new year-long rental agreement or raise her rent while she looks for another place to live.

Personally, I don't care who I pay, so long as she won't/can't later on claim that I had been negligent on my child support payments.  Is there some way that I can get her to sign an agreement that rent is and has been my official form of child support?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;California.&lt;/p&gt;

The location is the San Jose, California location.

Here is the timeline:
I went to my gym location and found out my account was terminated. I asked for the dates of each payment and renewal.
First payment was on 4-06-15. I went to school sometime in 2017 and came back in 2018 to renew.
I renewed it in 2018 with zero issues.  It ended on 9-24-18. Before I put it on hold, the associates assured me I could leave for school and my account would be fine and not terminated.

I am trying to renew it on 6-3-2019 and find out my account is terminated. I tried to contact representatives from 24 hour to figure out termination. 
I spent 1 hour waiting for their services and after I mentioned my name and membership, things were proceeding smoothly. I then mentioned my bally's membership, my call was immediately hung up, no call back. 

I waited another hour in queue and called again. This time I asked the person to call back to my number and gave them my number just in case any calls were dropped and they said they could contact me if it was dropped. My call was immediately dropped again after I mentioned my Bally's fitness mermbership, no explanation and there was no call back. He assured me he would try to callback if there were any issues with the call.

 I proceeded to call the sales department, they could not help me so they transferred me back to members services. 

Here I spoke to another representative who again told me that he assures me my call will not be dropped after I told him about the previous encounters. I spoke with him and gave him the same information I gave the others, my call was immediately placed on hold after I mentioned Bally's, the associate did not tell me it would be on hold. I After being put on hold without any explanation, my call was ended during that hold after about 20 minutes.

During each of these calls, I was very calm. I explained the situation to the best of my ability and did not raise my voice or give them any aggression that would make them want to hang up on me.

I wanted to know the reasons for my account termination but after 4 calls, I received no help and after being assured my call would not be dropped, it was. The thing I am most curious about is the timeline between 2015-2018 where I was able to renew it just fine without termination, but a couple months after in 2019, my accounts terminated.

I asked if I could speak to anyone higher than them, they said no, speak to the members associate department. Is there any legal action I can take? I can't even figure out the reason for my termination.

BTW, the location is in Los Angeles, California. 

We already paid the security deposit and first month of rent, as the lease started July 1.

However, the gas wasn't on when we first came to the house, and we asked them about it only to receive in response that they apparently made an administrative error in that they gave us some kind of general lease agreement that applies to other types of properties, so they'll only pay for water.

&amp;#x200B;

After, I asked them to send us a copy of the fully executed lease agreement, and they responded by saying that they never signed it, and that its best if we go with a revised document saying that theyll pay for trash services and water only, as the original we signed did not include trash. They claimed that trash services are thousands a month and that we would not want to be responsible for that. I feel like it is extremely unlikely that these services are that much, and we are going to call the trash services to weigh our options here.

Are we being taken for a ride here? We don't even like this property all too well as we just kinda shotgunned our selection of this lease. We might prefer to get another property as there are plenty of for lease signs up around the neighborhood, but we are not sure if we are liable to get our security deposit/first month's rent back as there never was a fully executed lease agreement.

Trying to avoid them getting ripped off here - the estate/probate attorney my aunt spoke to wants 7% of the estate, which frankly seems outrageous -- but while I know my way around investing, I'm out of my element on this one.

Assets:
Vanguard IRAs - ~$350k - all 3 named beneficiaries

Bank Account - $22k, no beneficiaries listed.  Aunt had PoA but that ceases upon death, so the money in here can't be touched for the moment according to the bank.

House - approx $130k valuation, no mortgage.

No debts on the estate.  Funeral already paid for.

From what I understand, it looks like $10k can be taken out of the bank account via [20 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 3101](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;ttl=20&amp;div=0&amp;chpt=31&amp;sctn=1&amp;subsctn=0).

Reading this, it seems like the IRAs would not have to go through any sort of probate.

That seems to leave the house, and $12k in the bank that we'd probably need to go through probate / legal help to settle.  I figure worst case, even if the 7% of the estate is a reasonable fee, we should distribute all of the other assets / things that don't have to go through probate first.  If he has to handle the house, fine, he can have 7% of that.  Not sure if an hourly rate would be cheaper or how many hours this process typically takes where there's a clear will and no one is contesting anything.

For tax purposes, it seems like hiring an accountant to handle the 4.5% inheritance tax in PA would be far cheaper than paying the estate attorney to handle.

&lt;p&gt;Now he is claiming we are responsible for having the carpets steam cleaned and that we should look into professionally cleaning it or he will have to deduct from our security deposit. I looked at our lease and it states nothing about having professional cleaning or carpet cleaning. It just says to return it in the condition you got it in. He is saying because he had it done before us then we have to do it when we leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apartment is clean for what it&amp;#39;s worth.     I don&amp;#39;t think we should have to pay for steam cleaning, I think that should fall on him bc it&amp;#39;s not in our lease and the carpet is in fine condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fully expect him to hold onto some of the security deposit due to this and I want to make sure I am justified to take him to small claims court for any cleaning/steaming charges he comes up with.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been at my current apartment for about a year and a half. I thought we signed a new lease agreement several months ago to renew (I remember because our rent went up). We’ve been paying the new rate (and on time) since February or so and I got a call today from the landlord asking if we still lived at the address. When I told him we did he said that he had rented it out for August 1st. 

To be honest I’m not certain if we’re on a non-termed policy that we just renew every year and can break with sufficient notice, but I think that is the case rather than a strict year-to-year lease. 

I’m also not sure if this new tenant signed a contract sight unseen but it’s even got me wondering if he was showing our apartment without our knowledge.

I’ve been at my current apartment for about a year and a half. I thought we signed a new lease agreement several months ago to renew (I remember because our rent went up). We’ve been paying the new rate (and on time) since February or so and I got a call today from the landlord asking if we still lived at the address. When I told him we did he said that he had rented it out for August 1st. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I’m not certain if we’re on a non-termed policy that we just renew every year and can break with sufficient notice, but I think that is the case rather than a strict year-to-year lease. &lt;/p&gt;

My electricity bill for the past 6 months have been between $70 - $90.  


This past month I've been having issues with my AC. Tl;dr, the thermostat was set to about 70-72 and it would consistently get over 80 degrees in my apartment. I filed a maintenance ticket, the maintenance guy came, and shrugged it off as 'its just hot outside, but if it gets over 80 again make another ticket'. I was out of town for the next week or 2, and when I got back, my apartment got to 81 and I sent a pic of the thermostat with the ticket. After that it is seemingly 'fixed' (although it did get to 78 yesterday).   


The problem occurs now that my electricity bill is $160, with about 80% of the cost going to cooling. Most of the highest usage was when my apartment was over 80 degrees. I talked to my neighbor (who lives across from me in the same building) who said her apartment stays perfectly cool and her electricity bill is $90 at the highest. I explained this to a woman in the leasing office, she told me to send her my bill and everything, and she'll figure out what she can do for credit regarding the electricity bill.   


Fast forward a couple of days to get an update (since rent is due), after going in yesterday and being told I should come back the next day, I'm met with another woman who said she meant to call me (but never did). Her explanation for it was really odd, saying that she lives in a house and her electricity bill is $200, that the thermostat is set to 70 in the office and its 74 degrees, that I shouldn't talk to my neighbors about it because each unit is different, and since the maintenance guy came within 48 hours after I sent the ticket it doesn't matter.    


For now, I left a note on my neighbors door explaining the situation a bit, and asked if she'd want to go with my to the leasing office (she offered to go with me the first time I talked to her). I'm frustrated because I shouldn't be paying this high electricity bill for what was a malfunctioning AC unit, especially after the first time I issued a complaint nothing was done.

As a result of the incident the acting front store manager informed the customer that she was no longer welcome in the store or pharmacy and to transfer her prescriptions out. 

Obviously, I came in to this Monday morning, and reported it immediately to my boss and our HR department. 

They responded to me today, telling me it is illegal to ban customers from a pharmacy for any reason and that if we feel threatened we can ask them to transfer but, if they say no there’s nothing we can do. 

I’ve been on LA enough on my real account for this to seem fishy to me. I don’t buy it and I think they are lying to me. 

I am very unhappy with the company stance. Not only in this situation, which is abhorrent, but the language of the email and saying we can’t ban a customer even if we feel threatened seems like a bad precedent to be let set.

I will list them individually, along with my questions regarding each issue. 

1.) When I first moved into my unit, I had a non-functioning front door. It was made of metal and due to heat/warping it was very difficult to open and close, and on hot days was immovable. Aside from being a huge fire hazard, it was also extremely inconvenient. I was assured at the time I moved in that the issue would be taken care of quickly. The door just got replaced... 11 months later. Am I entitled to any compensation of rent paid while I had a non-functioning door? 

2.) My apartment flooded last month. There was a tiny drain outside my janky front door that when it rained would often get clogged with leaves and other debris(I live in a basement unit). I was gone for a week, and came back to a flooded apartment. My landlord was out of town, and so my roommate and I had to deal with the aftermath ourselves, cutting out and disposing of the carpet in our living room. Am I entitled to any compensation/discount on rent paid while I had to live in an apartment without flooring? 

3.) The Landlord has scheduled for the floor to be leveled and have new flooring installed 5 days from now, from Monday-Wednesday. I have arranged to stay at a friend's house while the work is being done. While that is going on, we have to move all of our living room furniture over to our kitchen, rendering it unusable and making it difficult to access the bathroom and laundry room. He refuses to pay the extra money for the workers to move the living room furniture on the day of the installation, and instead demands that we move the furniture ourselves the Sunday before (which I cannot do because I am out of town), or have him come and move it today, five days before the job. When I said no to those options because a.) I'm out of town the day before and b.) I need a livable apartment while I'm here, he gave us the choice to either postpone the scheduled work being done, or raise the rent by $15/month when the lease is renewed August 1st, to cover the cost of having professionals move the furniture. I don't know if there's a legal term for what he's doing, but I'd call that a ""dick move."" So I just Chase quickpayed him $180 to have the furniture moved, in the effort of keeping things on schedule and prevent any more problems. My questions regarding that are: Do I ask for compensation for the days that I can't stay in my apartment due to invasive work being done?  And shouldn't he be required to pay for the moving of our furniture, particularly when that is the only option in which I can have a somewhat comfortable living situation throughout this process? 

Any advice is appreciated. I'm a little scared of posting this because my landlord is actually a lawyer and could potentially see this, but I'm fairly confident that I'm in the right here.

I apologize for the length so here's the tldr version.

I'm a college student interning in DC for the summer. I am subletting a room in a townhouse and when I arrived it was filled with trash and had a massive cockroach infestation. My fellow subletters and I cleaned the place up and I want to reduce my rent and reclaim my deposit. I would appreciate advice about what actions I can take. This is my last month in the place. My fellow subletters and I havent payed our rent yet- it was due on the first, and the guy is making vague legal threats, but I think it reasonable to delay until this is settled.

&amp;#x200B;

Below I've described the issues:

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted the guy with a list of complaints and photographs and he said he would pay for the cleaning supplies to clean it up myself. I also told him he would need to call an exterminator and a professional cleaning service; he refused. I cleaned the place at my own cost and time. He just got an exterminator and cleaning service after a month and bc the landlord forced him to. The place is so gross that we only go in our rooms and the kitchen.

(The place was definitely in violation of DC municipal code 400.3- no vermin, must be sanitary etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, he switched my room because the people that moved in earlier found it full of trash- there were prescription drugs and ""bodily fluid"" filled tissues strewn about in addition to plain old trash and discarded possessions. The room is also worse insofar as I am sleeping in a twin bed with a shitty mattress &amp; the other room has a memory foam double + a desk)

&amp;#x200B;

Last, I have a sublet contract but the landlord did not sign. The contract is generically off of the internet and doesnt specify my room or any real conditions but I have text messages of him telling me the room was not the one I had been promised.

&amp;#x200B;

What are my rights/options? I cannot afford a lawyer to fight this guy so I dont want to take it that far.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I am considering

\-Deducting my deposit from this months rent since I am concerned he will just keep it if I go through with anything.(Worried about this since my sublease specified that it would be returned at the end with any deductions in writing, but this guy has dealt with us in bad faith so I'm not really trusting that.)

\-Deducting the cleaning costs + time spent at DC minimum wage

\-Deducting 200$ for bad faith and switching me to a room with worse furniture.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I realize I made some due diligence errors and should probably have insisted on a better contract, but I was desperate for housing and had to take what I could find.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

 Last April in Arkansas ended up having a pretty big medical problem that required major surgery and as a result couldn’t work.  I ended up having to apply for ssdi with a lawyer and was approved and got my first check this last March . I was supposed to receive around 2,000 in backpay as well. However it’s now four months later and I haven’t heard anything. In June we went to the social security offices to ask because everywhere I’ve seen has said that 90 days is max wait for backpay after the check starts coming. The lady at the desk said that that’s not true and it takes even longer because they first have to pay the lawyer then see if I owe any fees from my prior ssi that I received from birth to age 18. I’ve been told that once the checks start coming that means the lawyers have already been paid. I’m not really savvy on any of this but four months seems a little long but I don’t really know. What should I do?

I ended up having to apply for ssdi with a lawyer and was approved and got my first check this last March . I was supposed to receive around 2,000 in backpay as well. However it’s now four months later and I haven’t heard anything. In June we went to the social security offices to ask because everywhere I’ve seen has said that 90 days is max wait for backpay after the check starts coming. The lady at the desk said that that’s not true and it takes even longer because they first have to pay the lawyer then see if I owe any fees from my prior ssi that I received from birth to age 18. I’ve been told that once the checks start coming that means the lawyers have already been paid. I’m not really savvy on any of this but four months seems a little long but I don’t really know. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Contacted the lawyer, he did receive his payment and asked if we went to the Social security office which we did, he said that’s what he would’ve told us to do but offered no other advice.&lt;/p&gt;

So here's the information.

My roommate and I are looking for housing for our next school year, a group of friends come to me and let me know that they found a 4 bedroom house for rent but they needed an answer right away. So we said yes, thinking that everything would be fine. Turns out there is a maximum limit of 4 tenants, this is a problem because there's 5 of us that will be living at the house. Two of my future housemates said that it would be fine and that the landlord never comes around unless there's a problem so fine I just go with it. I check out the place and we all agree on rent for each room and we pay rent that night to one of the housemates so that they could send it to the landlord.  The next day one of them starts complaining about how they think they're paying too much for their room which turns into raising the price for the master bedroom for me and my roommate. The initial rent was $900 for the both of us and they raised it to $1200 for a shared master.  This was absurd and too expensive for us since rent in Riverside, CA. is really cheap around us. We decided that we shouldn't live here and backed out. But now they're refusing to give us back our share of the rent when we haven't lived there.

In 2014 I financed a vehicle that I was at fault for totaling approximately 9 months later. Upon calling my insurance company at the time (Geico) I realized my coverage had been suspended before or around the time I financed the vehicle, and therefore they wouldn’t help me. The Toyota dealership which I bought my car at wasn’t helpful either. Neither was the bank with which I financed the vehicle. In the state of Florida however it is illegal to drive off the lot in a financed vehicle without insurance so I’m not sure who dropped the ball (other than me, yes I know I should have verified with my insurance) or who is at fault. At the time of purchase when I was in the office with the salesman he asked for my insurance card which I gave him, he called Geico and handled it all for me (supposedly), I co-signed with my father (who provided no insurance info) and drove off the lot. 9 months later when I totaled the car I received a ticket for driving without insurance, they suspended my license and I got sued by the other driver’s insurance company. As I stated earlier Geico never paid to fix the totaled car, and I cannot junk it as I do not own it yet so I have been paying monthly storage fees to some guy who owns a huge plot of land and I have STILL been paying $220 every month for this financed car I can’t even drive. I’ve been paying it this whole time so as not to ruin my credit but it’s still at just 550 so I suppose this has all been a giant waste of money. It will be paid up in November however so I’m almost out of the woods and that isn’t my main concern.

My main concern is this: In 2016 I consulted an attorney to handle some legal issues I had. One was the lawsuit against me. 
A second was to dispute with Geico or the Toyota dealership or TD bank and see who was at fault for allowing me to drive off the lot in an uninsured financed vehicle. 
The third was to reinstate my license.
Fourth was irrelevant to this case but still not criminal. 

Anyway. Out of all those things, the only thing he did was reinstate my license. Which, now in 2019, has recently been suspended again because the same insurance company is demanding payment from me. So in the end it’s like he did nothing at all, yet I paid him $3000 out of our agreed $4000. After almost a year of paying him almost monthly and him not settling ANYTHING of mine, I confronted him and he said he is very busy and can’t get to everything. I told him it isn’t my fault if he can’t handle his workload and that there is no attorney in the world who can charge $3k just to reinstate a license. Then I just stopped paying him. He never asked me for the last $1000. But now that my license has been suspended again I have called and texted him several times and he says he’ll handle it but again, doesn’t, and stops answering or returning my calls and texts. 

I think I’m just going to cut my losses and be put on a payment plan with the insurance company so I can finally be done with this. I am worried my current insurance company is going to find out my license is suspended and cancel me. 

What is most frustrating is I could have used that $3k I gave my attorney and probably settled with the insurance company but now instead it was just money wasted. 

So my question is this: Do I have any right to sue my attorney? I have a copy of the retainer agreement and I don’t know how but I’m sure I can provide proof he hasn’t done a single item on that list (except reinstate my license which then got suspended again because he didn’t handle the rest of the stuff on that list so does it even count???) and I have receipts for the cash I’ve given him. Can I at least tell the bar about him? Will that do anything? What recourse do I have?

Quarterly Supply and Demand Team Bonus Plan 
Objective of the Plan: The objective of the Quarterly Supply and Demand Team Bonus Plan (“the Plan”) is to share in the financial success of the company and reward team members for achieving their quarterly goals. 

Eligibility: Certain regular full-time employees who are eligible for a quarterly bonus will participate in the Plan. 
Effective Date: The Plan is effective for the period beginning January 1 through December 31 of each calendar year. 
Plan Components: The Plan is comprised of individual quarterly goals based on Company net revenue, individual gross and net revenue and individual achievement. 

Calculation of Performance: At the close of the quarter, each Participant’s actual quarterly amounts will be compared to the established quarterly goals, and the percentage of each achieved goal will determine the bonus payout. The participant must achieve at least 50% of the Individual Revenue Target (Gross and Net) to be eligible for the quarterly bonus. The maximum bonus payout is 200% of the Participant’s quarterly bonus target. 

Calculation Company Net Revenue goal achieved = $500 + Quarterly Gross Revenue Target X % of Quarterly Gross Revenue Achieved = $1,000 + Quarterly Net Revenue Target X % of Quarterly Net Revenue Achieved = $3,000 + Individual rating = $1,000 
Total bonus earned = $5,500 

Bonus Payments Participant’s bonus payments, in accordance with normal payroll practices, less applicable taxes and withholdings, will typically be within 60 days after the end of each calendar quarter. You 
must be employed on both the last day of the bonus period and through the applicable payment date in order to receive the Plan payment. 

Eligibility: Part-time employees, temporary employees, interns and contractors are not eligible to participate. Participants on a performance improvement plan during the quarterly period may also not be eligible to receive a bonus payout. 

Calculation of prorated bonus amount: If you are an bonus eligible employee for 30 calendar days or less, you are not eligible to participate in the Plan for that quarter. 

If you are an bonus eligible employee for less than a full quarter, payment will be prorated for the time in the Plan, provided that you are continuously employed as an active, full-time, eligible employee for 31 or more calendar days during the quarterly period. In addition, you must be employed through the end of the next consecutive quarter and through the applicable payment date for that quarter. The prorated amount for the initial quarter will be based on the percentage achieved for the next consecutive quarter, and will be paid in addition to the next consecutive quarters bonus. 

If you are on an approved leave of absence during a portion of the quarter, payment will be prorated for the active employment portion of the quarter, subject to the above, unless otherwise required by law. Your participation in the Plan terminates if you transfer into an ineligible 
position during the quarter. Payment is prorated by the number of work days in the eligible position for the quarter. 
Participant Bonus Targets A Participant’s bonus target will be based on the amount as stipulated in writing to the Participant. Any discrepancies will be resolved by the Company’s HR team. 
Plan Administration, Amendments and Termination: The Board will have the final authority to resolve any issues or disputes regarding the interpretation or administration of the Plan, and all such decisions of the Board are final and binding upon all parties. The Company may, in its sole discretion, make exceptions to an employee’s eligibility under the Plan; such exceptions are subject to Board approval. 
Name reserves the right to terminate, alter, amend, suspend or in any other way, align the Plan with the changing needs of the Company. Company reserves the right to restrict participation in the Plan at any time. Participation under this Plan does not guarantee the right to continued employment. A Participant or Name may terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, with or without cause; the Plan does not alter the nature of a Participant’s employment. If a Participant’s employment at the Company ends for any reason prior to the date the bonus payment is to be made, no bonus payment is due to the Participant. 
By accepting any pay under this Plan, you are automatically accepting the Plan, and agreeing that your compensation shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Plan, as it is currently constituted and as it may be changed from time to time. All amendments to the Plan shall be in writing and the amendment shall be deemed “accepted” by the Participant upon the Company’s publication of such amendment 
If any part of this Plan is found invalid or unenforceable according to applicable law, then the remainder shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I just put my two weeks in today and was told that I wouldn&amp;#39;t be getting my quarterly bonus cause I&amp;#39;m leaving before the scheduled bonus pay day.

She says because it has her business name on it she can't cash it unless it's in her name. We go back and forth and I do some research, everything I found says she should have no problem.

I have signed an agreement that I’ll work in the USA as a Camp Counsellor in Michigan on a J-1 visa. I am living in Poland and have polish citizenship. The agreement I signed was with US company, it was signed in Poland, forwarded by a Polish firm to the US one. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of the documents and payments were addressed to this Polish firm, the only mention of the US firm is in the programme agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I resigned prematurely from the programme because of the series fights and incidents that occurred on the camp: kids getting into all-in fights, by the end of the camp pretty much half of the camp was sent home. I wasn’t informed of such radical situation on the camp at any recruitment stage and as if something is to happen to the kids I am responsible, it’s simply too much responsibility for me to take.

&amp;#x200B;

So first, I had a phone call with the lady first about the “fee” etc. and was told it’s gonna be $1547. Told her I want an explanation where did this cost come from, which I never explicitly got. I told her “I understand the amount of money you want me to pay”

&amp;#x200B;

Later, I got an e-mail:

To: Name, Surname

Amount: $1,547.00 USD

Payment For: Other

Details: Fees for leaving camp early.

Invoice Number: 0000

Sent By: Her name

\[Link where I can pay\]

E-mail was also telling me to pay “as soon as possible”

I didn’t hear from her anymore, or didn’t contact her either.

Everything happened 6 days ago.

I didn’t get anything else, even an invoice for what I am charged specifically.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to leaving prematurely, I am told to pay $1574 to them. I don’t have any info concerning the amount I am to pay in the agreement, the only statement is: “contract cancellation fee will be charged”. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing more in terms&amp;conditions whatsoever. So the only thing about a fee is the statement above, no references to other regulations, anything at all regarding the pay and how it is defined or designated.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the agreement there is such thing: “California law applies to any disputes arising out of this agreement.”

&amp;#x200B;

Questions: I am living in Poland, what can I do with that? Can I bargain how much to pay if anything? Am I obliged to pay anything they send to me? What do I face if I don’t pay? What are my options to deal with this issue?

We came out to the summer and on the first week we put our name down on a piece of paper stating we agree to the rules of conduct (the rules were read out to us, we also have a big plaque with the rules on the wall, but the paper we signed only had a place for our name, signature and date, nothing else)

The fines are supposed to keep us accountable and disciplined, which is supposed to results in better performance. It can be argued either way if this is true or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in California and have a Workers Compensation lawyer working my case, but I'm looking for some outside opinions on settling my case from others who have dealt with the CA Workers Comp System.

I injured my Back at work and have seen an AME who ruled in my favor for the case. Now we are moving forward and I may need to decide on 1 of 2 options;

1. Take the weekly Partial Disability payout and have all future medical expenses covered.
2. Settle my case with Partial Disability plus a buyout of all future medical payments.

This is where I need advice. I just want to fix my back, so going with future medical expenses covered seems like the clear option. However, I have been advised that due to whatever bureaucracy is involved with CA Workers Comp, that getting future medical treatment may be complicated, outright denied and is out of my hands in regards of how I and my doctors want to treat my Back.  For example, if a doctor wants to do surgery, it goes through Workers Comp and they decide if I actually need it or not. If they decide I don't need it, then that's it, no surgery now or ever and no appeals. 

This makes a buyout of future medical more appealing because I can do what I want with the money to treat my back, but I assume that I wouldn't get enough to cover all treatments for the rest of my life.

So, have any of you been through this process before?

Do I have a correct understanding of how this works?

Are future medical expenses scrutinized enough that I may lose out going with option 1?

&amp;#x200B;

All of the documents and payments were addressed to this Polish firm, the only mention of the US firm is in the programme agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I resigned prematurely from the programme because of the series fights and incidents that occurred on the camp: kids getting into all-in fights, by the end of the camp pretty much half of the camp was sent home. I wasn’t informed of such radical situation on the camp at any recruitment stage and as if something is to happen to the kids I am responsible, it’s simply too much responsibility for me to take.

&amp;#x200B;

So first, I had a phone call with the lady first about the “fee” etc. and was told it’s gonna be $1547. Told her I want an explanation where did this cost come from, which I never explicitly got. I told her “I understand the amount of money you want me to pay”

&amp;#x200B;

Later, I got an e-mail:

To: Name, Surname

Amount: $1,547.00 USD

Payment For: Other

Details: Fees for leaving camp early.

Invoice Number: 0000

Sent By: Her name

\[Link where I can pay\]

E-mail was also telling me to pay “as soon as possible”

I didn’t hear from her anymore, or didn’t contact her either.

Everything happened 6 days ago.

I didn’t get anything else, even an invoice for what I am charged specifically.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to leaving prematurely, I am told to pay $1574 to them. I don’t have any info concerning the amount I am to pay in the agreement, the only statement is: “contract cancellation fee will be charged”. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing more in terms&amp;conditions whatsoever. So the only thing about a fee is the statement above, no references to other regulations, anything at all regarding the pay and how it is defined or designated.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the agreement there is such thing: “California law applies to any disputes arising out of this agreement.”

My friend and i both blocked the guy on facebook and blocked the phone number. you'd think it's over yes? No, that set the troll guy off even more and then he created multiple facebook accounts to harrass us, calling my friend a N\*\*\*er and that he should hang from trees... (My friend is black).

He borrowed money from my friend and didn't pay him back. Created multiple facebook accounts to do this and even got a new number to harass my friend. He talks about me in those messages as well. Most recently, ie; last night, he filled out a crime stoppers tip and called the regional police dept to tell them that I and my friend have underage porn on our computers. This is not true as i wouldn't even know where to go top get that stuff, nor do i care for it. same with my friend. I don't have any porn on my computer, not even perfectly legal stuff although I do peruse pornhub from time to time and rarely, hentai sites.  I know he did this as he posted randomly on my friends facebook feed saying he did that.

&lt;p&gt;The college person didn&amp;#39;t like that and called my friend and me every name under the sun and harrassed both of us. I met this guy at a party when my friend first met him. My friend and i both blocked the guy on facebook and blocked the phone number. you&amp;#39;d think it&amp;#39;s over yes? No, that set the troll guy off even more and then he created multiple facebook accounts to harrass us, calling my friend a N***er and that he should hang from trees... (My friend is black).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[He called me a gay pedophile on facebook and says i like underage porn. (I&amp;#39;m bisexual, and i came out at that party)](&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/X3kXSbe""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/X3kXSbe&lt;/a&gt;). He borrowed money from my friend and didn&amp;#39;t pay him back. Created multiple facebook accounts to do this and even got a new number to harass my friend. He talks about me in those messages as well. Most recently, ie; last night, he filled out a crime stoppers tip and called the regional police dept to tell them that I and my friend have underage porn on our computers. This is not true as i wouldn&amp;#39;t even know where to go top get that stuff, nor do i care for it. same with my friend. I don&amp;#39;t have any porn on my computer, not even perfectly legal stuff although I do peruse pornhub from time to time and rarely, hentai sites.  I know he did this as he posted randomly on my friends facebook feed saying he did that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what are our options, can&amp;#39;t afford a lawyer at the moment. If we ignore him will it all be dusted under the rug and be put in the past, so to say? or will we be in deep shit and go to prison for something that we didn&amp;#39;t do?&lt;/p&gt;

No one in his family wants to house him either. Is there anything that can be done?? Please, any advice is appreciated. For reference, we are in Texas.

The general home situation: 
His brain damage affects only his personality, making him angry at everything and unable to accept any blame. He’s a raging alcoholic. If he has any money, he spends every penny on booze and will get hammered at 8am until the end of the day. For this reason, my mom doesn’t give him his disability checks, making him even angrier. She does this in his best interest, and his money is kept safe and unspent. He has however stolen money from us in the past to get his fix. Because he has no job and is unable to drive, he spends his days making our lives a living hell. 
Every morning he wakes up and immediately goes into my mom’s office (she works from home) and yells at her. He’ll go into her room (they sleep in separate rooms) to go through her things, he’s taken her computer mouse a few times while she was working and ran away with it, he’ll slam her office door over and over again until someone gets involved. For the most part, he just stands there and degrades her while she continuously asks him to leave. She can’t get any work done. He also ruins the house. He broke the upstairs AC, he took the garage door off of its hinges, dented some walls by throwing things, etc. When he’s not doing an of that, he’s on the phone talking to people (I assume his lawyers) after every confrontation, lying about what just happened. We gather as much evidence as we can to prove these accusations wrong, but of course it’s not easy. You can imagine the house is pretty hectic. 

Current legal situation:
My mom doesn’t involve me in much of the legal stuff of course, so I don’t know everything. I do know that right now he lawyers are trying to find a compromise, but that’s unlikely to happen because he wants nothing but to bleed my mom dry. He wants the house, the furniture, all the money, the cars, everything. It’s likely things will need to go to court, but we’re at a sort of standstill right now.

Someone who stole something wouldn’t tell the truth. 
I just can’t understand why this is all the hotel would do. Don’t they want to maintain a positive reputation? 
I forgot to mention that after reading the response to her review, my mom called the hotel and they did report that they saw that two people entered the room in the time we were there. Why would it take two people to throw towels on the bed? I feel like the bad service is related to the theft. While there, we had to chase down toilet paper and other items, and we had to specifically ask for sheets so we could change our own beds.

I'm in a transitional period where I just broke up with my ex and need to find a place quickly.  I'm on a budget and in the past have always had great success using sites like Craigslist to find high quality rooms and people to live in/with.  [Roomster.com](https://Roomster.com) however, has wasted hours upon hours of my time (I've lost almost a week of night searching which is the only time i have to do this), caused a lot of stress and even set me back monetarily because I've had to spend so much extra time searching that I'm now going to have to spend more money to stay where I am.

Tonight was the last straw, whoever is responsible for posting/responding to the ads and who is also flooding the site decided to personalize one of the messages they sent me (they sent me at least 7 messages after I responded to around 2 dozen posts), in order to obviously trick me into going to their site.  It was even more suspicious and shady because every single message they sent was an exact copy until I called them out in one of the emails, which is when they started personalizing it and got me to text them.  The worst part is you can't do anything on the site but sign up and fill out a profile unless you pay, not even contact anyone on the site.  They jack up the price of finding a place quite a bit because they then expect you to pay for a bunch of add-ons (credit check, background, access to social media, etc).

I don't mind the business itself, I can definitely see where this would be convenient and also helpful at weeding out bad roommates, but the fact that they (or their marketing/seo team) are intentionally deceiving people has driven most of the legit traffic away from Craigslist.  They also admitted to me tonight after pretending that they are a Roomster employee via text message.

Aside from emailing the governor to inform him and ask that they introduce something akin to California's SB 1001, which outlaws bots from impersonating real people (in this case we'd be banning employees / people from impersonating someone else online), is there anything I can do about these sobs?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location: Denver, Colorado.  &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a dispute with my landlord about his withholding of my security deposit. I've been doing research online about the local laws and what can be done, but I have some questions about the interpretation that I'm hoping some kind redditors here can answer.

&amp;#x200B;

# Background

We move out after the lease expires on May 31st. Before moving we do some light cleaning like vacuuming and wiping down the walls/carpets.

Later that month (June 21st), Landlord just sends us a $190 refund from the $750 security deposit and copies of invoices from a carpet cleaning company and a deep cleaning company totaling $560.

After some research we find that in Utah ([source](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title57/Chapter17/57-17-S3.html)), landlords must send an itemized list of everything needing to be done beyond normal wear and tear. They did not send this, they just forwarded us the invoices. We believe the apartment was plenty clean. We didn't get it professionally cleaned but there weren't stains on the carpet or mold anywhere. There was some dust in some places but that was it.

Yesterday (July 2), Landlord emails us telling us that he fulfilled his contractual and legal obligations with his letter sending us the invoices and $190. He also attaches a move-out inspection basically saying ""everything is filthy"". The move-out inspection had pictures attached that just show some ruffled bits of carpet, some leaves on the patio and a bit blown in from the door, and some dust on the toilet.

&amp;#x200B;

# Questions

1. Does Landlord forwarding us the invoices count as an ""itemized list"". He sent us the move-out inspection after the 30-day deadline, and even that didn't include a list of what exactly was done that caused the giant bill. The invoices even included another apartment on them.
2. Does a little bit of dirt, dust, and leaves go beyond ""normal wear and tear""? Obviously the place is in a lesser condition than we got it and the pictures Landlord has show it, but as I see it this is pretty much expected and I shouldn't pay out of my pocket for them to clean it. The apartment should be professionally cleaned between tenants no matter how clean it was left.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href=""/r/legaladvice""&gt;r/legaladvice&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

We had two automatic payments bounce back due to “unknown location” and “insufficient funds”. The first one we have no idea what happened, the second we had to pull from our rent money for some emergencies that popped up, and forgot to cancel the auto payment. 

In OUR lease it states we will **not** be charged for what essentially amount to “hot checks”. 

The leasing office is trying to say they can’t waive the fees ($100) and that moving forward, they will be changing our lease. 

Two questions:

Given that our lease says there will be NO fee charged, do we have to pay?

And

We don’t have to sign this new lease, correct? We’ve been living here for over 6 months, at this point, the fault is completely theirs, right?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/IxrPfRi""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/IxrPfRi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As a result, there has been some speculation that this tract of land may eventually be sold and turned into a new housing development, which we &amp; our neighbors do not want.

Yesterday evening, our next door neighbors asked my partner to join them at a meeting at their home with representatives from our power provider. I was unable to leave work to participate. At the meeting, the two representatives from the power company provided our neighbor with an easement contract, letter from the energy company's ""Land Representative"" (who was not present), and an aerial map of our neighborhood showing their plan (link to redacted docs at the bottom). According to the reps, the green dotted line on the map shows existing underground power lines, which run between my neighbor's house (""2"") and our house (""1""). They would like to remove these lines, then continue the existing power lines (blue dotted line) along the path of the red dotted line. When asked why this was necessary, the reps couldn't really give us a sophisticated answer, so our neighbors refused to sign.

After reading through the easement agreement, the language appears to (obviously) be written strongly in favor of the power company. We are left wondering whether this is benign &amp; pretty boilerplate, or if we should put up more of a stink to have the agreement rewritten to protect us/our neighbors from tearing up their/our yards. Both us and our neighbors also have privacy fences running parallel to each other with only about 18"" in between them, so we're also worried that the removal of the old lines could cause damage to our fences that the power company wouldn't be responsible for repairing. Additionally, this contract appears to give the power company the right to install above ground lines if they saw fit, which naturally we do not want anywhere near us. Are we being overly skeptical here? Should our neighbors squeeze the power provider for more than $1? If our neighbor refuses to sign, can the power provider somehow circumvent them legally and do what they want anyway? Though the rep assured my partner and I that we would be in no way affected by this, page 2 of the agreement mentions ""adjoining lands""--is that us?

My daughter recently moved back in with me and brought with her my old car (titled to me) which does not run. At her old house, it was parked in the driveway, but when it was towed to my house it had to be parked on the street, curbside.

&amp;#x200B;

The car is not registered and has no insurance. It will be donated to charity, but that had to wait for a week, or so, while I got a certified copy of the title. I have that, now, and it will be picked up on Friday and be out of my hair, forever.

However, yesterday - two days after it was towed to my house - the car was hit by somebody. The other driver left a note with contact information, which admitted fault. But my question is, was I legally obligated to re-activate liability insurance on it? Also, I told the man who hit it that I did not intend to report the accident or make any claim for damages - should one of us have reported it to the police? There were no injuries.

hello here is the situation.

so the house i am renting out is listed as a four bedroom and i live in one of the rooms, but it doesn't have a window. it sucks. so i've done a bunch of research and it is supposedly VERY illegal to rent out a room without an egress window (in case of fire). i've told my landlord this, repeatedly, and the only thing she responds with is ""we have a certificate of occupancy."" i even gave her the number for a contractor i know, so she can, you know, BUILD A WINDOW, but she is ignoring me. i've considered calling the city to have them do an evaluation of the room and the legality of calling it a bedroom/having someone live there. but i don't want to push it too hard because i like my house and none of us want to be evicted. so i guess i'm wondering, could we be kicked out if we call the city of tempe about the ""unlivable"" condition of this room? could my landlord evict us or terminate our lease? should i just keep pushing my landlord to build a window without calling the city? i want a window desperately so i don't like, DIE in a fire.

I just finished some research after being reminded of some suspicion I had a few years back from a previous job application. 

Years ago in Iowa City (2011), I was issued a ticket for urinating behind a dumpster. I was curious about how this could potentially be getting in the way of employment considerations. I then just now stumbled on the following article: https://www.thegazette.com/2012/02/16/ui-students-say-public-urination-charges-likely-affect-job-prospects

In this article, it mentions that public urination and indecent exposure were under the same code. An article published a month later goes on to say that a measure was passed to make it clearer which offense was committed. My question is if that is likely to only be a separation displayed in future cases or if it applies to cases the year before, etc as well. 

I tried to get this expunged a few years ago because I believe I was denied a position due to this. I didn't know that there were others with the same issue and unfortunately the judge didn't seem to care.

First off, my husband and I are in our mid twenties and have never been in an accident, so we have absolutely no idea what we’re doing.

Basically, we were driving through an intersection—in the farthest right lane—along with the flow of traffic, the speed limit was 45, but it was raining, so we were going well under the speed limit. A woman driving an suv cuts out in front of us (she was facing us from the middle turning lane and turned left, crossing traffic. We hit the brakes, but because she cut RIGHT in front of us, we slid into her rear right side and damaged the whole right front of our car. Took out the headlight and caused a bit of cosmetic damage. Everyone seemed okay, so we both moved off the road from the middle of the intersection to get information. My husband asks if she is okay while I call the police, she gets out of her car and immediately starts yelling at my husband, saying that he shouldn’t have been speeding. I told her we were simply driving through a green light, and she said hers was green, too. I asked her if she had a green arrow or not, because if not, you need to yield to traffic. She said she didn’t have a green arrow, but that she didn’t need one because it was clear, and that she “missed all the other cars.” I told her evidently it wasn’t clear, to which she started yelling at me for being on the phone with the police, because she already called the police and I was apparently wasting my time. The 911 operator heard what was up and told us just to get into the car and wait for the police so we wouldn’t argue with the woman. The damage to her car was minimal, barely more than a dent. The police showed up and took our statement, to which we simply stated because she pulled out in front of us, we had no time to stop and slid into her after hitting the brakes. I’m not sure about the other woman, what her statement was, or if she was cited for not yielding or what. EMS showed up and we had them look over our 18 month old that was in the back, to which the woman snarled at me like I was an idiot for having them check her out, everything was fine and so everyone went their separate ways. Fast forward and her insurance company calls us to ask for our side of the story, we tell the same one, they ask for photos, we send them. They email us that the estimate for damages on our car is a little over $1600, and then proceed to tell us that we were 15% at fault for the accident. Our deductible is $500, and our insurance company is leaving it up to us whether we want to file a claim and have them fight it for us or not. It just feels super wrong to accept that we were at fault in any way for this. Neither of us has ever had an accident or ticket, and I’m not sure if it would mess with our insurance if we accept it. 

Sorry for the ignorance, I just have absolutely no idea what to do here, and any insight or advice would be appreciated.

Sorry for the long post and formatting, I’m using the mobile app, and I don’t know much about posting as this is my first post. 

So my sister, Tee was just sent a letter stating that she has been terminated from her job. She is currently on sick leave. 

Tee got a job at a well known security company as a security guard. The site where she was placed was a 5 minute walking distance from her house. It was a residential building, and the conditions were clean. Tee took time off her job last November 2018 because of declining health. She is in her late 20’s and is on dialysis due to both of her kidneys failing in her early 20’s. When she started working at this company, she was doing peritoneal dialysis at home. Her work schedule was 7 day a week with five 8 hour shifts and two 12 hour shifts(on the weekends) followed by 3 days off. I believe it’s called continental rotating shifts. 

When she was on home dialysis, this schedule was ideal for her. She worked on this schedule for 1 year. Eventually though, he home dialysis was no longer effective and she had to have a catheter placed on her chest for hemodialysis. Because of this, she had to go into the hospital 3 times a week for 4 hour sessions of dialysis. During this time, she(and other security guards)was being harassed at work by an aggressive mentally ill resident at her site. The resident was issued several warnings to stay away from all the security guards who worked on the site. Tee was most targeted by the resident. At one point Tee had to hide in the party room from the resident who was yelling and being aggressive. Tee was eventually removed from the site and put at another site because of all this. 

The other site was an outdoor guard post. It was extremely dirty and humid in there all the time. There was dust and ants everywhere. Tee emailed her supervisor 3-4 times about the dirty working conditions, and about changing her schedule. Tee would go to dialysis in the morning, then rest for an hour and then got to work. She was often late to work on the days she had dialysis. In the span of a few months, Tee had to get 3 surgeries to replace her catheter due to infection and spent several days in the ER. She ended up having to take several weeks off in the few months that she worked there at this site. She cannot prove that the unsanitary conditions of the site caused the infections, however, since leaving this site, she has never had a problem or gotten sick. 

She was eventually got called in for a meeting with HR regarding all days she had missed and how often she was late to work. Tee had told her supervisors about her condition, but her supervisor had failed to mention it to HR and Tee assumed that HR was aware. At this meeting Tee asked for a different site and a more accommodating schedule. HR told her that she had this schedule for over a year and had not said anything up until this point, no accommodations can be made and if there is a problem with the schedule Tee should look at other job options as they cannot change the schedule. Tee bought up her new dialysis schedule and HR asked for more clarification and when Tee explained, HR said they did not know her about condition. 

After the meeting, nothing changed. Her schedule remained the same and so did her site. In November 2018, Tee had become really sick. She had to take time off work and informed her supervisor and HR. HR said she would need to provide a doctors note for the time. When Tee asked for her ROE, HR said they would need another doctors note so she can get her ROE for EI purposes. Both notes were provided. Every few months, my sister would get another email asking for an updated doctors note. 

Last Week We received a letter sent by courier, addressed to my sister(she does not live with us)The letter arrived at my house and my mother signed for it. We gave the latter to my sister over the weekend. The letter stated that my sister come in for a meeting with HR on July 2nd. Tee ended up missing the meeting(which is totally her own fault btw) due to another appointment. Today she received and email stated that her file was closed. This is the email: 


“I have tracked the document on Canada Post and it shows that you received the document on June 26, 2019. Further, it is your responsibility to update your address with the Company which you failed to do.

At this point in time, your employment file has been closed as you failed to report for the meeting scheduled yesterday July 2, 2019 and did not contact me prior to advise of any reason for your absence. 

We kindly ask that you return all uniform items to our Training Center location. Your ROE will be released electronically to Service Canada.

We wish you all the best in your future endeavors.”

I guess my question is, can they fire her while she’s on leave?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone. Sorry for the long post and formatting, I’m using the mobile app, and I don’t know much about posting as this is my first post. &lt;/p&gt;

She was often late to work on the days she had dialysis. In the span of a few months, Tee had to get 3 surgeries to replace her catheter due to infection and spent several days in the ER. She ended up having to take several weeks off in the few months that she worked there at this site. She cannot prove that the unsanitary conditions of the site caused the infections, however, since leaving this site, she has never had a problem or gotten sick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was eventually got called in for a meeting with HR regarding all days she had missed and how often she was late to work. Tee had told her supervisors about her condition, but her supervisor had failed to mention it to HR and Tee assumed that HR was aware. At this meeting Tee asked for a different site and a more accommodating schedule. HR told her that she had this schedule for over a year and had not said anything up until this point, no accommodations can be made and if there is a problem with the schedule Tee should look at other job options as they cannot change the schedule. Tee bought up her new dialysis schedule and HR asked for more clarification and when Tee explained, HR said they did not know her about condition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, nothing changed. Her schedule remained the same and so did her site. In November 2018, Tee had become really sick. She had to take time off work and informed her supervisor and HR. HR said she would need to provide a doctors note for the time. When Tee asked for her ROE, HR said they would need another doctors note so she can get her ROE for EI purposes. Both notes were provided. Every few months, my sister would get another email asking for an updated doctors note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Week We received a letter sent by courier, addressed to my sister(she does not live with us)The letter arrived at my house and my mother signed for it. We gave the latter to my sister over the weekend. The letter stated that my sister come in for a meeting with HR on July 2nd. Tee ended up missing the meeting(which is totally her own fault btw) due to another appointment. Today she received and email stated that her file was closed. This is the email: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I have tracked the document on Canada Post and it shows that you received the document on June 26, 2019. Further, it is your responsibility to update your address with the Company which you failed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point in time, your employment file has been closed as you failed to report for the meeting scheduled yesterday July 2, 2019 and did not contact me prior to advise of any reason for your absence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kindly ask that you return all uniform items to our Training Center location. Your ROE will be released electronically to Service Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish you all the best in your future endeavors.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my question is, can they fire her while she’s on leave?&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So my ""Friend Stole My Information and Took Out A Loan In My Name""... but it's much more complicated than that.

To begin, at the end of March my friend came to me after an awful break up (her boyfriend drained their joint bank account) and begged me to co-sign on a loan for her because she didn't think her credit alone would be approved... I agreed. **Yes, I know how stupid I was to agree to co-sign on a loan** but this was my best friend, I would have taken a bullet for her. I knew she was in need and had to help. Anyways, she asked for some of my information (W-2 info, address, SS#, etc.) **Yes, I know it's stupid to give someone your social security number** but I trusted her 1000% and I'm only 22 and have no idea how the world works yet. I gave it to her and a day later she called me crying tears of joy because it got approved.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast-forward to this week, I'm sitting down with my parents reviewing my college loans (I just graduated in May so I have to start paying in December) and I notice a strange ""credit inquiry"" on my Credit Karma. After a little investigating, I found the loan company and noticed it was for the same amount my friend said she needed the loan in ($5,000) so I thought it was suspicious about it and confronted my friend about it. I asked her why it would show up on my credit report if I was supposedly just the co-signer and she was the borrower, she had ""no idea"" and told me it should be fine. Trusting my gut feeling, I called the loan company and gave them my name and they said that I am the borrower. They told me that they don't even have cosigners for this type of loan. Come to find out, she took out the loan entirely in my name using all of my information. She forged my signature and created a fake email address using my name.

&amp;#x200B;

I confronted her with all of the information and she played dumb. She showed me proof that she has paid for the past 3 months (since the loan was taken out) and she intends on continue paying... I don't trust her. This is a three year loan and if something happens to her or if she no longer pays then I am the one who will suffer the consequences.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to the loan company and they can't switch it to her name and info (for obvious reasons) but they sent me an Identity Theft / Fraud information packet to fill out with the police. I called one of the credit bureaus as well and they put a flag on my account so that if she ever tries to use my information again for another loan or credit card, I will be informed.

I need advice on a few things:

* Do I take this to the police? What will happen? ((If I do take it to the police, my friends dad is a cop and I'm afraid he will be corrupt through his situation...))
* Will the police even be able to do anything this I willingly gave her my information (even though I 100% agreed to being a co-signer and she lied and made my the borrower &amp; forged my signature)?
* If I take this to the police is there a way she can use other things against me (she knows I smoke weed because I went to school in CA and have tried some hard drugs once)?
* Is it possible to get a new social security number?

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago a friend (UK citizen) was dismissed from a job in the British Virgin Islands. She appealed the dismissal at the local labour government office under unfair dismissal but the case was brushed under the carpet because the company she worked for has lots of connections with the government and they shut it down. They booked her flights back to the UK so she had to leave the territory four days after being dismissed. She did not get her right to appeal nor her employment records which she has requested and is a legal requirement under BVI labour code. 

They are now refusing to pay the last month wages saying there is an outstanding phone bill. However she is yet to see this bill. 

Every avenue seems like a dead end. Getting any legal advice in the BVIs goes quiet once they know which company she wants to fight. And she’s not sure if she can get a solicitor from the UK to help her.

Albany NY","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the problem Im having is I have past medical bills that have been sent to a private lawyer for collections. The date of the hospital visit was over 6 years ago. I had at the time no insurance. The bills were sent to an address I hadnt lived at for over a year. They continued billing that address while interest compounded. Back then I didnt know anything... ANYTHING i had no idea that you could ask for a payment plan or even forgiveness. Anyway fast forward to about 4 years ago. When i was sued at work. Ok so i began chipping away at 9000 dollar principle and 2000 dollar interest. At this current point since i began paying i havent even touched the actual bill. Im nearly unemployed at 20 hours a week. Im looking for full time work, my contract just ended [another long story] but in the meantime the lawyer keeps asking for paystubs, and im not making enough to live and send them anything. Its at 45 cents a day now and i havent been able to pay in 2 months. They are aware as they call all the time and send letters.

They were right, the fee *is* outlined in the lease. Specifically:

&gt;VIOLATION OF LEASE CAUSED BY RESIDENT. You agree to pay us two hundred dollars ($200) if police are called to the Property as a result of your occupancy or the illegal activity or disturbances by you, your occupants or your guests as a reasonable estimate of our costs resulting from such actions which would otherwise be difficult to calculate. In addition, if a courtesy officer or patrol was required as a result of your conduct, you agree to reimburse us for the prorated cost of that courtesy officer or patrol.

She explained the domestic violence situation to the complex. They were aware that the man was arrested. But they only came back with the same canned response of this fee being part of the lease she signed and that she should have read the lease.

I fully understand the fee if the police are called to a unit because it's residents and/or visitors are doing something that is harmful to other tenants. But I hadn't considered that I or my neighbors might need to pay a $200 fee if we are in a scenario where we need to ask the police for help to stop a serious crime from occurring in our unit (domestic violence, an armed intruder, etc). Is this fee actually legal in scenarios like this?

I've hunted for the answer to this online, but haven't found this exact situation. I'm hopeful that someone here can point me in the right direction.

Either way, I'm horrified that a victim would be fined for asking the police for help, so will be leaving the complex when my lease is up.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neighbor at my complex called the police when she was in the midst of a domestic abuse situation.

&amp;#x200B;

It has now come to light that he still owed 6 month’s rent when he left. The landlord who was getting on a bit went through a period of ill health around that time and it seems he didn’t keep good track of his rent coming in, we both paid our share of the rent separately and I continued paying my half, where unknown to me, roommate did not. A new tenant then moved in and all was fine. Landlord is now not in good health again and the landlords grand daughter has started taking care of landlords finances for him. She has been checking through for any back payments that were owed when landlord had his first period of ill health.

So she has now brought the outstanding rent that roommate did not pay to my attention, she has admitted that she nearly did not bother to check as she thought unpaid rent had to be claimed back by a land lord within two years, but it was only when her friend made her aware that the two year period applied to oral rental agreements and written lease agreements (like ours) have a four year time limit (CA).

Despite admitting that she was not aware of the four year time limit, she is now having me evicted for non payment of rent and she is demanding that the full six months back rent of $4000 is paid otherwise I will be sued. If she had checked this four months later it would have been more than four years since the lease was signed so I can’t see that she could have then claimed anything from me in back rent.

No big deal, it's 4am and the owner of the park gets there around 6am.  The other guy says he's leaving his to get help from up front with a tractor (we aren't far from the front office at all).  That was a great idea to me since I know the owner of the park personally and their was no reason to break anything.  Very simple solution.  I don't know this guy, I""m just trying to help like I've done a million times in the past on the trail.  At this point, nothing is broken on either SxS, just stuck.   


He leaves, then I leave.  Instead of him waiting he decided to get his truck and recover his SxS himself, no big deal and he did no damage to his vehicle or SxS.  Right after that he decided to steel my RZR before I could get back.  He wrapped a chain from his truck to around the frame of my SxS and proceeded to get a running start over and over until it came out by force.  The trailing arm is broke in two pieces, radius arms bent, axle broke, shock broke and frame bent badly.    


Beautiful part is there is a witness to the whole thing and he gave his statement to the police.  The criminal told the witness he knew me and that I paid him to recover it.  I had the key in my pocket and didn't know the thief or the witness.  Witness even asked the guy why he was trying to destroy the SxS if he was doing me a favor!  


So this thief loaded my SxS on his trailer behind his SxS and left the park immediately.    


Good part of the story.  He was on camera leaving the part entrance.  I posted a pic and video on Facebook of his vehicle with both SxS on the trailer, less than 1hr goes by with 600+ shares later and he's been spotted by a good samaritan who saw the post.  The sheriff's deputy pulled him over and arrested him with my vehicle in possession.  2nd degree felony charge.  How they didn't charge his wife who was with him during all of this, I don't know.  Vehicle is recovered, but damaged.  


So I gathered his information from the report, used his license plate and called his insurance company to file a claim since he did all the damage using his vehicle. Insurance company reports back that since it was a criminal act, they will not cover the damages.    


How should I counter this or am I fighting a lost cause?  From my point of view, he did the damages without my consent using his vehicle and the damages were done before it became a theft case (assuming it was theft when he left the property).

I have a rather strange predicament that I could use some advice for!  I'm In New York.
Last winter, I went to a big-name oil change location and got an oil change. This May, my car (it's leased, if that's important) began flashing an urgent light on my way home. It instructed me to pull over immediately and turn off my car, so I did, and contacted the free tow service offered by my lessor. They nabbed the car, gave me a rental, and I was on my way. After an inspection, they let me know that the oil filter had been incorrectly applied using some kind of wrench/tool which had dented and punctured the oil filter. With some rainy weather we had, this caused rust and a leak. They gave me the oil filter, their report and several photos of the filter attached to the car before the repair. They recommend going to the oil change company for a reimbursement since, in their opinion, the issue was solely caused by the oil change company and was completely preventable.
I opened a claim via chat and phone call with the oil change company and had my case assigned to the Regional Manager. After speaking to him (he also spoke to the lessor/mechanic personnel to confirm what I told him) he requested that I send over copies of the photos and paperwork I received from the mechanics. I complied, and didn't hear from him again. I spent a few weeks reaching out, again via chat and phone, trying to check the status of my claim only to be told that he was in charge and looking into it, and that he would be in touch soon.  
Now we're here - I got very frustrated and spent today trying to contact this man. After several calls, I finally got connected to a customer service rep who said that he had closed my case back in June and that he should have called me to give me the details of his findings. He did not, and despite her promise that he would detail this to me by close of business today, I haven't heard from him. This customer service rep was kind enough to pass me the info for the secretary of the CLO.  
My main question is what can I do next? Is it appropriate for me to attempt to contact their legal team? The paperwork from my lessor is very clear that this was caused solely by the oil change company, that I was not at fault, and that they would be happy to clarify that with the oil change company. After touching base with my lessor, they said he had called once when I first began this process and pretty quickly hung up when they indicated that it was the fault of the oil change company.  
Is there any legal recourse for this? It did cost several hundred dollars in repairs and rental fees. It was essential that we get the car back as soon as it was road ready, as I am a student and a nurse so not having a vehicle would be a huge issue. If there is recourse, what are my next steps?  
Thank you all for reading this. If I'm just out of luck at this point, I'll be disappointed but can accept it.

I am a college student who accepted an internship position for the summer. The internship included free housing, a stipend, and **covered travel**, which was important because I would be travelling a far distance between my home state and the state the internship was located at. My current issue is that I had to pay for two check in baggage, which was unavoidable, and the internship seems to be refusing to reimburse me for the cost. The contacts at the internship say that since it was my responsibility and choice to bring on those extra luggage, I had to pay for it out of pocket. 

&amp;#x200B;

My contact for the internship had booked the flight for me, which was through United and had a layover in LAX. When I had seen the flight reservation, I noticed an odd baggage policy (I usually fly through a different airline) and had emailed her back asking her if she had noticed it too and if it would pose any issues. I didn't receive a reply from her and just carried on with my life until the day of the flight. When I checked in, the airline told me that I could only take 1 backpack with me on the plane since it was too small for any carry ons and flying a short distance for the first layover. So I had to pay $70 for my two suitcases. If I had to only pay for one of them to check in (because that was my choice to bring both a bigger and smaller suitcase), I would be fine with paying it, but it was unavoidable for me since the first plane didn't allow ANY baggage besides a personal backpack. This internship was literally located across the Pacific Ocean and lasts over 2 months. It's not feasible to expect me to only bring one backpack. If I had known that they would have done this, I would have insisted on a different flight option (and there were many other flight options around the same price). 

&amp;#x200B;

The internship webpage has a reimbursement form, but when I asked my contact about the issue she strongly discouraged me from filling it out and was insistent that I was responsible for the cost. Is there a way that I can ask to be reimbursed? Is it fair of me to ask for reimbursement?

We had a roommate move in with us 2 months ago. Let's call him Christopher. He paid us upfront for rent as well as a security deposit equal to the first months rent. We never signed a contract, but we verbally agreed that the deposit was for in case there were any damages he incurred while staying here, but more importantly, it was to guarantee that we got at least a 30 days notice before he decided to leave. After all, he is a complete stranger we found offline. 

When the next months rent and utilities came time to be paid, he ignored most texts and calls about it. And the few times that he actually responded he gave BS reasons why he didn't have rent. Either he claimed he never got the texts, or he got off work too late and was unable to go to the bank. One time he actually claimed that he got the money but left it at his work desk. Another time he said he sent it through Venmo, but it went to another guy with the same name... Eventually, about 5 days after rent was due (we paid his portion with his security deposit) he finally paid us. We hoped this was a one off, but here we are again... Weeks ago we started to ask him for other utilities that were due and he ghosted us or used the same excuses. He goes to work really early and comes home around 11pm, gets drunk and passes out so we've had very little face time to talk in person. We thought we would just have him pay the utilities when the rent is due as there won't be any reason he can't just do it all at once. 

Then, a week ago on the 26th (4 days before rent is due), Christopher texts me and says his brother died in a different state and he is going to move back to help his family. BUT he will help find a guy to take his spot to avoid a lapse in rent. My girlfriend and I get home that evening and there is literally some guy sitting on our couch talking to Christopher. He randomly sprung this interview on us and we felt ambushed but proceeded. We didn't like this new guy, but we cannot afford rent without him, so we all agreed to think it over and get back to him soon. New guy said to let him know before the first. We message him 2 days later on the 28th and don't hear back. Christopher texts us and says the guy found another place to live. We put up an ad looking for another person to take the place.

Fast forward to today. We have been texting Christopher everyday since the 28th asking for rent as it's due on the first. It is now the 3rd and he responded saying that he will be coming home tonight and taking all his stuff and leaving. He wants his deposit back and is willing to prorate the 3 days he spent here so far this month, leaving us a whole lot of money in the hole. As I mentioned earlier, we agreed that he needs 30 days notice before leaving and we don't want to give him a penny of the deposit back. He also said that it's our fault as he found a replacement and we didn't get back to him until it was too late.

It's important to note that he claims to be a paralegal and this might end with him trying to sue us or at least intimidate us with his position. He's also a diagnosed pi-polar, something he never disclosed to us when he moved in. We found it after doing an in depth Google search on him and his past crimes (nothing too serious, but he has been arrested a couple times).

Anyway, can someone please help us out and let us know what we can legally do.

Another time he said he sent it through Venmo, but it went to another guy with the same name... Eventually, about 5 days after rent was due (we paid his portion with his security deposit) he finally paid us. We hoped this was a one off, but here we are again... Weeks ago we started to ask him for other utilities that were due and he ghosted us or used the same excuses. He goes to work really early and comes home around 11pm, gets drunk and passes out so we&amp;#39;ve had very little face time to talk in person. We thought we would just have him pay the utilities when the rent is due as there won&amp;#39;t be any reason he can&amp;#39;t just do it all at once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, a week ago on the 26th (4 days before rent is due), Christopher texts me and says his brother died in a different state and he is going to move back to help his family. BUT he will help find a guy to take his spot to avoid a lapse in rent. My girlfriend and I get home that evening and there is literally some guy sitting on our couch talking to Christopher. He randomly sprung this interview on us and we felt ambushed but proceeded. We didn&amp;#39;t like this new guy, but we cannot afford rent without him, so we all agreed to think it over and get back to him soon. New guy said to let him know before the first. We message him 2 days later on the 28th and don&amp;#39;t hear back. Christopher texts us and says the guy found another place to live. We put up an ad looking for another person to take the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today. We have been texting Christopher everyday since the 28th asking for rent as it&amp;#39;s due on the first. It is now the 3rd and he responded saying that he will be coming home tonight and taking all his stuff and leaving. He wants his deposit back and is willing to prorate the 3 days he spent here so far this month, leaving us a whole lot of money in the hole. As I mentioned earlier, we agreed that he needs 30 days notice before leaving and we don&amp;#39;t want to give him a penny of the deposit back. He also said that it&amp;#39;s our fault as he found a replacement and we didn&amp;#39;t get back to him until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to note that he claims to be a paralegal and this might end with him trying to sue us or at least intimidate us with his position. He&amp;#39;s also a diagnosed pi-polar, something he never disclosed to us when he moved in. We found it after doing an in depth Google search on him and his past crimes (nothing too serious, but he has been arrested a couple times).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, can someone please help us out and let us know what we can legally do. The 3 of us that live here are starving artists and don&amp;#39;t have experience with this.&lt;/p&gt;

My grandfather left a large estate in CA when he passed several years ago. This was back at the end of 2015. His will was a revocable trust that left everything to his 3 surviving children, and then the surviving children of his deceased children. One being my mother, the other my aunt. So my mother's share goes to myself and my brother, and my aunt's share to my cousins. They named one of his children, my uncle, as the executor of the estate. Every one of the heirs live in CA except my brother and I, who moved to GA. Nor sure if that matters for this or not.  


When I saw large estate, I mean 2 $600k+ houses in CA, investment accounts, bank accounts, physical possessions in the house, etc. Everything was paid off, so no debtors to pay off or medical expenses. The final hearing to disburse the trust to the heirs happened in June of 2018. He was able to quickly list and sell one of the houses and make an initial dismemberment of the trust to the heirs. That was all fine and dandy. Then in December of 2018 he cashed out about half of the stocks that my grandpa had, and dispersed that out to the heirs. Again, fine and dandy. Except the next paragraph with the current issues.

&amp;#x200B;

OK here's the issue. When he cashed out those stocks he did so without letting anybody know. We basically got a surprise check in the mail. He did not mention anything about taxes either. So fast forward to now. For some unknown reason, he didn't file taxes on the stocks he cashed out in the trust until after the deadline this year. So all of us heirs got hit with a letter in June 2019 saying hey you owe some taxes now, and all of us had already filed our 2018 tax returns. This caused us to all have to file amendments and pay penalties. He claims he was just too busy to file on time, but we're all having to pay for it now. Pretty inconvenient.

&amp;#x200B;

The second huge issue is, the second house hasn't sold yet. Why? Because he wanted to remodel it to make more money on the sale. It's now been nearly 4 years since my grandpa passed and the trust still has to pay taxes, upkeep, utilities, and the cost of remodeling during this time. In other words lowering the amount of money left in the bank account. He has still not listed the house because he claims it's not done and still has a few more things he wants to do. Taxes in CA are high, it's a $600k + house so maybe $6k+ a year in taxes, plus other upkeep, maintenance, and insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, we just want him to just sell the house, liquidate the rest of the stocks/bank accounts, and finish out dispersing the rest of the trust to us. We think he's spending more money than what we will get out of the house. Every time one of us writes or calls him, he ignores us because he knows we're going to ask him about the status of selling the house. He's blowing all of us off.   


It's getting to the point some of us feel like contacting the attorney who handled the trust and seeing what options we have. I don't want to start a fight because I don't know what power my uncle has over the trust and don't want it to cost us. At the same time we don't think he's managing it well and it's costing us either way.

&amp;#x200B;

So reddit, what options would we have at this point?   


TLDR: Uncle named executor of grandpa's estate, heirs feel like he's not managing it well and it should have been closed out and dispersed by now. Uncle ignores heirs when they ask what's going on. Worried he's over spending and not managing the trust wisely, and we want to know our legal options.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story, TLDR at the end.

This is regarding a balcony renovation project in my building. The building is about 50 years old. We have old concrete barriers up out on the balconies and those will be jackhammered, demolished and replaced.

The project is estimated to complete in October 2020. When they began with the other side a few months ago, I asked my super if he knew when they would be getting around to my side, he said it probably wouldn't happen this year. But last night when returning from the store, I noticed a sheet in the common area explaining that they will be starting work TODAY (Weds July 3rd)

Now before I get into the issues I wanna say I absolutely am grateful that they are putting in the work. However ANY level of improvement doesn't justify the living conditions we will have to endure for 15+ months:

#1 -- the barricade of my door and windows will be depriving us of all air circulation. I assumed it would be 2x4 pieces of wood over the door but they are installing plywood sheets reinforced with 2x4 over the door and both windows. The building has no central air circulation. We rely on this door and these windows. We face west, there is LOTS of sunshine and it gets extremely hot. I am also asthmatic.

#2 -- they have included a warning that anybody who wants to install an air conditioner will have to pay $250 dollars. This feels pretty extortionate.

#3 -- the apartment is a bachelor. the balcony accounts for about 1/4 of my total floor space. No arrangements have been made to accommodate my possessions. Presumably I will be expected to either throw stuff out or pay for storage. At this point we're looking at around $2000 in monthly expenses for a miniscule bachelor apartment with no air circulation whatsoever.

#4 -- I need to check my lease for specifics but I am pretty sure that this interferes with reasonable enjoyment. It's been about 24 hours and already we are feeling the psychological effects. 

Basically I want to know what I can do. I am after a rent reduction. if I find that they are within the limits of the law on this, I am going to do what I can to change that. I do not accept that this is something you can legally do to people and charge even more money. I have a feeling they are hoping most of us will leave so that they can charge more to new tenants. 

Sorry if this post rambled. I am at work now tryna make money so I can pay this rent!

YES they did provide notice about the work to be done by the way. But miss me with any ""you could have moved"" bullshit. My unit's rent went up 400 for new tenants in three years so moving absolutely hasn't even been possible.

Pshht.. and they say tenants have more rights than landlords...

&lt;p&gt;YES they did provide notice about the work to be done by the way. But miss me with any &amp;quot;you could have moved&amp;quot; bullshit. My unit&amp;#39;s rent went up 400 for new tenants in three years so moving absolutely hasn&amp;#39;t even been possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pshht.. and they say tenants have more rights than landlords...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway curious to hear what people think. Thanks for reading and sorry again for the rambling.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I am starting a new business venture which may need some investment in the future. since it is such a small business, i don't want to take the risk of using any loans or agency's to get funding from so i figured i would tell my friends and family about the venture and if they want to invest then great.

The problem is that, like any start up there is a real risk of me losing their money and so i would like to have protection from being sued in this case.

I am looking for an agreement like a release of liability agreement but worded in a way so that they are taking all the risk and if i loss there money then they cannot sue me and i have no liability. Of course i do not wish to lose any of their money but i would just like the protection. Could anyone tell my the right name for this agreement or direct me to template that i could use? I am not sure if a release of liability agreement is the right one that i will need in this case.

My dad moved out in 2011/2010 time. He never paid me or my mother any money (like child support). When they separated, the solicitor told my mother that £12,500 would be ""more than generous"". She gave him £20,000.

&amp;#x200B;

After a year without child support he told me he would start to pay us £20 a month... which he did for about 3 months. My mother got us a lawyer and he signed a document (which she still has) as a sort of informal promise to pay.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently he's been a bit of a dick to me and my mother told me that if I wanted to we can take him to court and claim every missed payment since he signed that. He's unemployed despite being fully healthy, he just prefers to play GTA and claim benefits. I know that he wouldn't have the money for it straight away

My boyfriends car had been overheating. He thought he could fix it himself by replacing the water pump but that was a much bigger job than he anticipated because of the model he has so his dad told him to just take it to a shop and he would help him pay for it. Well what was originally supposed to be replacing the water pump turned into them telling him that they were going to need to replace the whole engine. It took them weeks of tinkering with it to discover this and they even quoted him the incorrect price on the phone. For a new engine they said it would be $3000. My boyfriend said he would think about it and talk it over with his dad. When he called back the next day, they said 4200. No explanation of the price increase except to deny ever telling him $3000. Anyway, he told them he would just come get his car and pay them for their labor so far and take it elsewhere or any other work. 
Then he gets to the shop and they tell him that they will make him a deal. They will apply the 1200 that he already owes for labor to the 4200 and he would only have to pay 3000 for the new engine. Sketchy, I know. But he decided to do it so that he would at least get something for the 1200 he already owed them. 

Moving on to the important part, they said it would take a week to fix the car. Now I know this is just an estimate, but let me explain. They told him the engine was coming from Orlando. I’m not going to say where we live but it is less than two hours from that city. They said the engine should arrive within the week and it would only take a day to put it in so it should be ready the following Monday (June 24th). He paid them half of the money on June 19th. Now since he was going to be without a car he continued to call and check on the progress so that he could plan accordingly. On Saturday June 22nd, they said it would be ready Tuesday June 25th. They said the engine would be arriving Monday. So he calls Monday and there is no engine. Now I could make this story go on forever because he has called every day between then and now and every single day almost they have told him it will be ready the next day. So I’m just going to explain the main points from this week.

They assured him the car would be ready last Thursday. They told him with such confidence that he took off work early and made arrangements to go get the car then on his lunch break that day when he called they said they still did not have the engine. He asked them to find out where the engine was. The guy said that he called the company they were getting the engine from and it should be arriving Saturday morning. So my boyfriend calls them Monday July 1st and lo and behold the guy on the phone says that his car is out for a test drive and to call back in an hour so an hour passes and he calls back, then the guy on the phone tells him something was running a little rough and they wanted to check a few more things but it would still be ready by the end of the day. They close at five. So five rolls around and no one has called him to come get the car so he calls them back. Now the guy on the phone informs him that he got confused. The car out for a test drive was not infact my boyfriends car, but a different car, THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE THE ENGINE. 

Remember that they claimed the engine was coming from less than two hours away. Quite frankly by now I probably could have pulled the engine here in a wagon on foot. But the guy on the phone says that he called the company with the engine and they said they would have it “tomorrow” (July 2nd) 
So yesterday my boyfriend called and they had the engine!! Great! So he got the money and arranged  to go get the car AGAIN. Now about one minute before he got off work and went to get the car they called him and said that there was lightning in the area and one of their mechanics has PTSD and had to go home so the car would not be ready. At this point I think it’s pretty obvious they are giving him the run around. But they said the car would be ready today. Today he calls them and he is told that the radiator blew. Now I’m wondering if we are ever getting this car back. They have mislead and lied to us for over a week. I really do not know what we should do at this point. Do we call corporate? Report to BBB?

I want to start by saying that I have no intention of suing my landlord, I just want to know if I am being reasonable in my wishes.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Two weeks after I alerted them to a slab leak (no water leaking, just a warm floor), my landlord drills a hole in my floor trying to locate the leak. Unable to locate it, they leave without plugging the hole. Two days later, my living room floods when water comes out of this hole. Everything seems okay except my 8-cube cubby shelf which has one side warped by water damage. It's particle board so water damage is really bad for them, and now I cannot turn it right side up to use as a bookshelf because one side looks horrible. Is my landlord liable for this damage?

&amp;#x200B;

About three weeks ago I noticed my living room floor was warm in one spot. Google let me know this is a slab leak. I immediately alerted my manager, who stopped by that day or the next, felt the floor, and said they would be by soon. About a week and a half to two weeks later, the manager and landlord come by, feel the floor, turn off my fish tank filter and listen for water, plug in filter, and leave. I'm at work at this point, but I come home to find my fish filter running but no water going as it is not self priming. Fish are okay.

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday of last week, they stop by again. They unplug the fish filter. They end up drilling a hole in my floor to look for the leak, but all they find is it is damp under there. They leave without plugging the hole or turning my fish filter back on. I get home to dead fish (one did survive). They did say they will reimburse me for the fish.

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday night, around 11:30 PM, I find that my living room floor is covered in water. They couldn't find the leak, but the leak found us. It came out from the hole they drilled, soaked my small rug, soaked the bottom of my cubby shelf that I was using to hold my stuff under the TV, and got the bottom of my fish tank wet as well. The rug and other furniture seem fine, but the cubby shelf I had under the TV now has one long side that is warped from water damage, and it's just particle board which does not hold up well against water. It was only temporary as a tv stand, it's main use is to be turn long way up as a bookshelf, but now one side is warped and ugly, and the particle board likely won't bear the same weight it did.

&amp;#x200B;

Should this be my landlord's responsibility to replace or reimburse? I alerted them early of the possible leak. No water was coming up until they drilled a hole and then DIDN'T plug the hole up, they just left it. The cubby shelves are only like $50 so I have no intention of really pushing the issue if they say no, but I want to know for myself whether they are being good landlords or shirking their responsibilities. I do have renter's insurance but they said due to my deductible they wouldn't pay anything out PLUS my rates would go up, and said renters insurance is meant for large accidents.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Diego, CA&lt;/p&gt;

The rug and other furniture seem fine, but the cubby shelf I had under the TV now has one long side that is warped from water damage, and it&amp;#39;s just particle board which does not hold up well against water. It was only temporary as a tv stand, it&amp;#39;s main use is to be turn long way up as a bookshelf, but now one side is warped and ugly, and the particle board likely won&amp;#39;t bear the same weight it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should this be my landlord&amp;#39;s responsibility to replace or reimburse? I alerted them early of the possible leak. No water was coming up until they drilled a hole and then DIDN&amp;#39;T plug the hole up, they just left it. The cubby shelves are only like $50 so I have no intention of really pushing the issue if they say no, but I want to know for myself whether they are being good landlords or shirking their responsibilities. I do have renter&amp;#39;s insurance but they said due to my deductible they wouldn&amp;#39;t pay anything out PLUS my rates would go up, and said renters insurance is meant for large accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

So my work has an on-site network, and a website for when we are not at work.

&amp;#x200B;

This website allows us to check our schedule, see our upcoming paycheck, and other things.  The most important being, if you are not able to make it to work, you 'call off' via this website.

&amp;#x200B;

You MUST perform a 2 step verification in order to use this website. You have 2.5 options.

&amp;#x200B;

1: Download a work app on your phone. This app replaces their in-house equipment, and allows you to use your phone to scan items to determine the home, etc (This is big box retail.) I maintain I will not download a work app on my personal phone for many reasons, personal, security and privacy related. If they want me to use it for work, they will issue me a phone. This is Fortune 500 standard practice, and my employer is Fortune 5 status.

&amp;#x200B;

2: Receive a phone call to your personal cell number OR

2.5: receive a text to your personal cell number.

Which is fine and dandy to all the rest of you, but I am deaf, and I do not have a cell plan. I have Wifi, and Facebook Messenger to communicate with those I need/want to.

&amp;#x200B;

There are NO other methods of performing the 2 step verification.  We (as in, my in-store HR) have called regional and corporate management and been advised that there is no other method available, even though when it was first announced last year, the posters indicated that email would be a valid method.

&amp;#x200B;

I am concerned that this places me in great jeopardy should I become ill, and need to miss work. There are obviously severe legal issues for myself and my (massive financial target) employer should I attempt to drive to work while severely ill in order to inform them I am unable to work, and get into a vehicular accident of any sort.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, not reporting to work without informing them obviously places my employment in jeopardy.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I go about addressing this with the large faceless corporate headquarters that is 2000 miles away?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Yes, I am a social hermit. That is my right if I so wish. I am not obligated to waste my money paying to join the rat race in their technological addictions. Especially when said technology is of little to no use to me. Telling me to buy a cellplan, or calling me socially backwards is not useful, nor even related to the entire issue.

Hi folks. Long story short: I applied to a Federal Gov’t job in Canada with Corrections (prison guard). I passed the written test, interview, one month online course, psych evaluation/interview, medical exam, and was officially accepted to recruit training. I disclosed somewhere along the line that I was medically released from the Canadian Armed Forces partially due to injuries sustained in a special duty area (Afghanistan), but have recovered now and am ready to get back to work. Corrections contacted me and told me I required additional medical screening because of my medical release from the CAF (understandable, Corrections Officer is a dangerous job and they need to cover their butts). My file was given to a subsection of Health Canada where a doctor requested my military medical final-release evaluation. I initially refused because it’s none of their business (the file contains very detailed information about childhood injuries, things I told mental health professionals in the military, my parents/siblings health, minor injuries from when I was recruited 12+ years ago, legal substance abuse issues from the past which no longer apply). I contacted them and explained that these things are not the business of Health Canada. I passed their medical and psych evaluation, and if they have specific questions, ask them. I was informed that they needed the information for “holistic evaluation” (aka they want to gather as much info as possible about me to make the best informed decision), and if I didn’t give them the military medical record then they would simply deny me.

I contacted people at Health Canada, privacy act, Human Rights Act, and other government organizations. I was bounced around a lot, and the final government answer as to the legality of what Health Canada did was “We’re not sure, but it was probably fine”. Corrections Canada denied me employment based on that military medical release record due in part (Veterans Affairs involved) to injuries sustained while serving my country (I included clean bill of health evaluations from my GP and Psychologist and explained that those issues I dealt with upon release have improved due to hard effort and my GP and psychologist say I’m ready to return to work).

No one I talk to seems to have an answer on this. It seems crazy that someone would be allowed to demand my previous medical records, even if they both are government agencies (they are different branches). If I was applying to a non-government agency they wouldn’t be able to demand my personal medical records (personal or employment related), even if it was a dangerous position. I believe that if they weren’t gathering the proper medical information, then they need to change their medical evaluation, not demand my military medical records (which contain the majority of my whole life’s medical issues pre-military and very personal issues).

Any advice on this or advice as to who to speak with would be appreciated.

TL:DR - Medically (and honourably) released from Canadian Armed Forced (10+ years of service). Applied to Corrections Canada (federal) after 1 year of recovery (doing awesome now). They demanded my military medical final-release evaluation (containing VERY private and non-relevant info about me and my family) for “holistic evaluation purposes” (stating that I would be denied employment if I did not provide it). They read it and denied me employment due to those operational injuries, despite a clean bill of health from my GP and psychologist.

I'm in Virginia, USA

I should have recorded the call myself, and I'm definitely going to in the future, because this is ridiculous. 

In March, I asked for a debt settlement from this collections agency. It was my understanding that this large sum payment that I was making was to settle the entire debt. I made the payment, and they said they would send me the settlement agreement via email for me to sign. This part is definitely my fault, because after a couple days of waiting for it, I kind of just forgot about it and figured it was over with. I was stupid to think so. Last month, I was charged $800 dollars from this company. When I called them, they said they have no record of a debt settlement being made. I told them that it was my understanding that the large sum payment I made in March was to settle this debt completely, and asked for them to review the recordings. They said they would, and would honor any agreement made on that call. 

They hadn't called me back in 2 weeks, so I called them. After 2 hours of being on hold or being hung up on, I finally spoke with the manager. He said that he listened to the recordings, and that no settlement agreement was made. I asked if I could have a copy of the recording or a transcript and he said that it would be against the law to provide that. 

How am I supposed to know if what hes saying is true? If I was able to listen to the recording, I would accept whatever it was that I said. If I hadn't actually agreed to a settlement, fine, I'll let it go. But I feel like they are lying to me, because I remember asking multiple times whether this was a settlement and they said yes. I asked if this means the account will be closed and they said yes. That is what I remember, but I know memories can't always be trusted. Do I have any legal recourse to get ahold of that recording? And if I find out they're lying to me, what can I expect if I take them to court?

If you need more info just ask.

Im in quite a dilemma here. I have never received a ticket before and am a little new to life. I appreciate your patience. 

CVC5201.1 (a) A person shall not sell a product or device that obscures, or is intended to obscure, the reading or recognition of a license plate by visual means, or by an electronic device as prohibited by subdivision (c) of Section 5201. 
(b) A person shall not operate a vehicle with a product or device that violates subdivision (a)

I got pulled over by an officer late in the evening on my way home. The officer stated the reason why he pulled me over was because license plate on the back of my car was illegible. He stated that the reflective coating around the digits were peeling off (his words) and issued me a ""fix it ticket"" under 5201.1 (b). I bought the car with the plates a year and a half prior and the issue was never brought to my attention, nor have I ever tampered with them. After I returned home, I got out of my car and pointed a flashlight onto the plate, Where I could clearly see the issue. The reflective coating had peeled off in between each and every digit of my license plate, making it impossible to read from a distance.

I replaced the plates at the DMV and was issued some new ones, without taking pictures of the old plates.(dumb move?) I stopped by the police station and had another police officer sign off under the certificate of correction box on the back of the ticket. I scheduled my appointment to appear in court today, two weeks before the deadline on my ticket. However, when I went online to pay the supposed $25 fine, my balance due is $1,105. I am a 19 year old working full time to support myself and this fine would break it for me. 

I have scheduled an appointment to appear in day court on the 9th of this month and eight days before the deadline on my ticket. I want to dispute the fine and request a 30 day extension to the payment deadline.

I am wondering as to what would be the best steps to take from here. I was reviewing similar posts relating to my issue on this sub and one OP got roasted for the fact that they turned their plates in without photo evidence. However, since mine is marked as a correctable violation, I am wondering if I have a leg to stand on or if I should start looking into traffic lawyers. I do not have any pictures with the old license plate on the back of my car.

My girlfriend had been clean for going on 3 years now. ""Legally"" clean for a year.   She got caught in November 2017 with Suboxen on her that she purchased from someone in order to make sure it worked before she went through the whole rigamerol (sp?) Of getting the prescription for it.  With that charge came a felony (in RI if you get caught with a possession of ANY drug, from coke to heroin to a prescription drug in someone elses name, even an antibiotic) for possession of a Schedule I - Schedule V Narcotic.   Her punishment and case was dismissed unofficially, and officially defferred for 2 years. The agreement was basically go to counseling, get a prescription for suboxen, take suboxen and pass drug tests for 2 years and poof felony is expunged from her record.  Since then she has passed every drug test, and had positive write ups from the counselor given to the judge, therefor showing an impeccable record.

Fast forward to last Thursday, I am driving home and get a call from the a local police department phone number. I answer its her.   She has been arrested for buying crack cocaine.   Now keep in mind she has never done crack, and her drug of choice WAS opiates, preferably percocet.  I of course act like any good supporting boyfriend does and flips the hell out asking 400 questions. Come to find out her friend asked her to get it for her (great friend, on both accounts right??? Also before anyone makes assumptions. I saw the text convo between said friend and my girlfriend, and also between girlfriend and drug dealer, and she was being honest about it), she met up with the dealer and picked it up. He drove her down the street and come to find out 3 under cover cops surround her, and the dealer *mysteriously* casually drives away.  Anyways they pick her up.

She gets slapped with another Schedule 1 to Schedule V possession charge.   Also gets charged with being a violator.  So i think shes going away now because she violated conditions from her first charge, right? Nope. She gets bail for the 2nd charge, for $1,000. And the same for the violation charge. So 2 grand bond total.  

My question is this.  What should she do come arraignment? Plead nolo? Guilty? Not? What can we do to prevent her from being sent to jail if anything? Also, this is probably stupid but...is there ANY way she can get away with getting one or both of these charges dropped? She has been trying really hard to stay clean and still is, and still is suceeding.  But she is feeling like its useless because she made a stupid mistake for a useless friend.   

Can I give her any REAL optimism with this? Can she still get away with staying in outpatient care? My head is spinning as well as hers too.  And the cheapest lawyer is 4 grand. And the public defender is essentially useless and telling her admit guilt and go to jail for 3 months.  

Any real and serious honest advice is appreciated in advance.  Also this took forever to type on my phone, so excuse any errors....and if you have any questions to help clarify ask away and I'll respond as quickly as possible.

LL agrees to allow me to break the lease only if I pay 6 months rent or find a replacement roommate to take my place prior to moving out who can prove enough income to cover rent in full. Have an appt with an attorney today to begin the suit against roommate**


I am sharing an apartment with someone I didn’t know before moving in. I found this apt through a broker and so did he. We were ‘matched’ (I think roommate had a different broker but not sure tbh) and signed a one year lease together last month. First month rent was required at signing and he paid half of the total rent at this time to the broker. 

We pay our rent online and I noticed yesterday that he only paid $50. When I asked wtf he told me that he can’t afford  any more than that and that he will be paying $50 towards rent for the rest of the lease. Voices were raised (by me) but he was calm and basically just shrugs and said whatever. 

I reached out to our landlord who told me that they don’t get involved in roommate disputes and suggested I look into civil court. I asked what would happen if our rent isn’t paid in full and LL said he would have to initiate an eviction. I asked if he could evict my roommate only since my rent is being paid and he said he can’t since we are on the same lease and that he would have to evict both of us. LL then sent an email to both of us reminding us rent is due by the 3rd for no late fee. 

My roommate is not going to pay his half of the rent. Other than the lease we have no written agreement that says he agrees to pay half. I have all my communication with my broker which states that the rent for the apt is split in two since it’s a two bed. 

I am planing to pay his portion of the rent then sue him to recover it. I can’t afford to have an eviction on my record and be blacklisted. Since there is 11 months left on the lease and he will do this for the whole time I am trying to figure out the best way to sue him.
I looked up small claims but it says there is a max of $5000. If I sue him at the end of the lease he will owe me $17,400. I tried to figure out if I could sue him now for the money he misses this month and request the judge include something saying he also owes the full $1,500 every month for the whole lease but I can’t find if that’s possible. What do you all suggest I do?

What is my best option here? I can afford to pay his portion of the rent to avoid the eviction BUT only if I can recover it. I know he can afford to pay it because if he couldn’t he wouldn’t have been approved last month (though I didn’t see his application and don’t know if he had a guarantor).

Suggestions?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit:roommate ignoring me. LL agrees to allow me to break the lease only if I pay 6 months rent or find a replacement roommate to take my place prior to moving out who can prove enough income to cover rent in full. Have an appt with an attorney today to begin the suit against roommate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sharing an apartment with someone I didn’t know before moving in. I found this apt through a broker and so did he. We were ‘matched’ (I think roommate had a different broker but not sure tbh) and signed a one year lease together last month. First month rent was required at signing and he paid half of the total rent at this time to the broker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pay our rent online and I noticed yesterday that he only paid $50. When I asked wtf he told me that he can’t afford  any more than that and that he will be paying $50 towards rent for the rest of the lease. Voices were raised (by me) but he was calm and basically just shrugs and said whatever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to our landlord who told me that they don’t get involved in roommate disputes and suggested I look into civil court. I asked what would happen if our rent isn’t paid in full and LL said he would have to initiate an eviction. I asked if he could evict my roommate only since my rent is being paid and he said he can’t since we are on the same lease and that he would have to evict both of us. LL then sent an email to both of us reminding us rent is due by the 3rd for no late fee. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So I lived in a horrible apartment in Brooklyn for a year. The management never fixed anything, we had health inspectors come by and say the place wasn't livable because there was a lot of mold in the basement (which was locked off and we weren't allowed to see). I moved out and the management refused to give the security deposit back. They never responded to calls, or emails for months before and after move out. They were not at the original office location and did not tell me the new address for their office.

I filed a complaint with Better Business Bureau outlining all the issues with maintenance, mold and security deposit. At the end of the day all I wanted was my security deposit back. After months of not getting any replies from the management I was giving up. A month after I filed the BBB complaint I finally got a call from them telling me to come pick up the security deposit from their new office. When I got there they told me they would give me the security deposit on the condition I remove the complaint. (I ended up amending the complaint stating that they paid me the deposit (6 months after move out) only on the condition that I remove the complaint. 

Almost a  year later now they've started calling me repeatedly demanding I remove the complaint since the issue was ""resolved."" My two other roommates did not receive their deposits back. I told them how I got mine back but I don't know if they ever pursued it further. 

My complaint still tells about the mold/health inspector, maintenance issues, and general problems dealing with their horrible management.

Should I remove the complaint a year later/do they have any legal recourse if I don't. I wanted to leave up the complaint so other people may see it. They were truly the worst apartment I have ever lived in.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Guys,&lt;/p&gt;

We finally got the bill around a month ago but were told the claim was denied because her stay was incorrectly coded as being part of our IVF procedure (which it sort of was but should have been billed as an entirely separate event), which was recoded.

So around September of last year I was in the market for new phones for me and my GF.

I was chatting with various companies online about what kind of deals they can offer.

Finally i got to Verizon where the Agent offered me a great plan, BOGO phone, with a special rate on the plans for $55/Line. Multiple times I asked her what the final bill would be after taxes and I got a direct answer $151.81 and we went over this price a couple times and she assured me that my bill would be 151.81 after taxes and fees. I said that sounds great, and she sent me the contract through the chat and I signed paid the initial due and that was it.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I get my first bill and the total is $184.XX and I contact them and tell them the situation and they took care of me issuing me a credit to get my bill to the agreed upon price. This has been going good since it started (other than the inconvenience of having to contact Verizon every month) until today. Today the agent said that in the notes I am only supposed to get 4 months worth of credits and it sounds like they are trying to weasel their way out of the deal that they got themselves into. 

&amp;#x200B;

Location: Florida, USA

What happened:

I own a printing company. As printers, we do a lot of graphic design, typesetting and the like. The programs we use to do this are the normal ones, but our preference and the ones we use the most is not quite as famous as In-design or the like.  The program we use, however, we use almost exclusively.

When starting up for the day, a pop-up occurred out of nowhere stating that the program we are using is an illegal copy, and they want us to pay $250.00 ""no questions asked"" . This pop-up also disabled our program to the point we could not save or print anything.

In very small letters, there was a ""click here"" if you think you received this message in error.

Naturally, I click it, and am put in a chat with a person from the company. This person informs me that I have to PROVE the program I am using is not an illegal copy. He wanted the windows version I was using, the version of the program I was using, a picture of the original CD, Box it came in and code for the Cd and a receipt of purchase.

I was at this point thinking this might be phishing, but I verified it was not.

This truly was the company that made the program forcing me to prove I am  not a thief before I can continue using the program .

This stopped production in my shop. The program does not transfer well to other programs, so all the work we were in mid-process with came to a screeching halt. We had to recreate entire jobs that were almost done in other programs to try to stay on-time.

Meanwhile, while I was losing my temper over this whole situation, I was providing proof that yes, indeed, I am not a thief and this is my program legally. They kept asking for more proof. I let slip that ""we use your program all the time, I have version XX and XX too!""

They now wanted to see the SAME proof for those other versions that we no longer even used as they were obsolete!

I pretty much told them to go stuff themselves and demanded they release my current version, as I proved beyond a shadow of a doubt it was mine and not a pirated copy.

TWO DAYS of this before they sent me instructions, asking me to edit my registry files to try to repair the damage they caused.

Ugh.

So they break my program.

Demand i prove it is a legal copy

Tie up my production for two days

then send me directions to fix it that can damage other programs if done wrong, and said ""bye!""

&amp;#x200B;

A part of me wants to let it go, and never buy those programs again. A part of me wants them to pay for what they did and make them realize they can't just do this.

Lawsuit?

Class action? I cannot be the only one they did this too.

Another solution I cannot think of?

Pretty much, I want them to regret this. I will pay thousands of dollars to make them not do this to others, even if I never see a cent back.

I make my money as a self published author on amazon. While the money is not huge, I am still young and single, and I can live very comfortably off of what I make.

I'm planning to go to the US (I live in Europe) in August, and travel around for a month or so before going back home.

The good part about my job is that I can really do it anywhere I want, as long as I have my laptop with me.

However, I am obviously not a US citizen.

My questions therefore are:

1) Can I legally keep working while traveling (I.e. actually writing the stuff I publish).

2) Can I publish stuff (not write / edit, but actually put up for sale) while in the US?

3) If the answer to question 2 is 'no', is sending the stuff I want published to Europe where a family member will publish it in my name a viable ""loophole"" or is that also a bad idea?

Although I suspect I would probably get away with it if I just published stuff (that I'm making money off of) while traveling, I would prefer to stay as above board as possible.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Spoke with the apartment complex today, they've apparently found my missing room in a 2x2 unit -- just as stated in the lease. I've learned a lot, so thank you all for that!

**___**

Lease is signed by both parties as of several months ago.

I entered into a lease with an apartment complex for a 2br 2ba unit, with a move-in date of mid-August. Yesterday, I got a phone call from them and they claim they can't offer me a 2x2 unit anymore -- they tried to get me to switch to a 4x4 for a *whopping* $15/mo decrease from normal 4x4 pricing.

Now I'm nearly a month from the date I need to move, and I don't have an apartment. I've found a 1 br 1 ba unit across town in a new complex that I like, but it's considerably more expensive and I don't believe I could even enter that lease until I settle this mess. (I couldn't afford a double lease.)

This is an apartment complex for students, and largely for first-time renters (like me). I strongly feel they do this on a consistent basis. I did not speak directly with the landlord, but with the student worker in the front office -- I was told the landlord would call me but when I called 2 hours later I was told that she left for the day even after being notified I was waiting for a call.

Here is a relevant section of the lease agreement:

&gt;In the event Landlord cannot deliver possession of the Leased Premises to Resident on the Lease Commencement Date through no fault of Landlord or its agents and despite our reasonable efforts, Rent shall not abate; provided, however, Landlord shall provide substitute living accommodations (which may be a hotel room comparable to the Leased Premises, based on a monthly rate comparable to the Rent due by Resident under this Lease, availability, and other factors as dictated by hotel) until possession of the Unit is given. Landlord shall provide you with access to one (1) 10’X’10’ climate controlled storage space during the period that Resident does not have possession of the Unit. Landlord or its agents shall have thirty (30) days after the Lease Commencement in which to give possession of the Unit to Resident, and if possession is tendered within such time, Resident agrees to accept the Unit. In the event possession cannot be delivered within such thirty (30) day period, then this Lease and all rights and obligations hereunder shall terminate upon conclusion of the thirty (30) day period from the Lease Commencement Date. 

**TLDR;** The lease specifically mentions a 2x2 floor plan, though no specific unit is listed. They say there are no 2x2 units left because they oversold.

Do I have any recourse? Should I just seek to terminate the lease so I can find a landlord that hopefully gives a shit?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoke with the apartment complex today, they&amp;#39;ve apparently found my missing room in a 2x2 unit -- just as stated in the lease. I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot, so thank you all for that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;___&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lease is signed by both parties as of several months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered into a lease with an apartment complex for a 2br 2ba unit, with a move-in date of mid-August. Yesterday, I got a phone call from them and they claim they can&amp;#39;t offer me a 2x2 unit anymore -- they tried to get me to switch to a 4x4 for a &lt;em&gt;whopping&lt;/em&gt; $15/mo decrease from normal 4x4 pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m nearly a month from the date I need to move, and I don&amp;#39;t have an apartment. I&amp;#39;ve found a 1 br 1 ba unit across town in a new complex that I like, but it&amp;#39;s considerably more expensive and I don&amp;#39;t believe I could even enter that lease until I settle this mess. (I couldn&amp;#39;t afford a double lease.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an apartment complex for students, and largely for first-time renters (like me). I strongly feel they do this on a consistent basis. I did not speak directly with the landlord, but with the student worker in the front office -- I was told the landlord would call me but when I called 2 hours later I was told that she left for the day even after being notified I was waiting for a call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a relevant section of the lease agreement:&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Unsure if this is a situation where I'd be able to take legal action or would have to go through some other route but I suppose that's why I'm here! In November of 2017 I got braces put in by my orthodontist. I of course provided my dental insurance information and they talked to my insurance and figured out that my total payment would be about $2K with my insurance covering the remaining $1K. We went with a slightly pricier option of clear, smaller brackets but it seemed worth it if I was paying. I had had some money in my HSA for this very reason and paid it all upfront so I wouldn't worry about it.

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning of this year (so a year and some months later), the assistant at my orthodontist's office called me over after my appointment and said something had happened with my insurance. They had just noticed that they'd been only getting $17 per month from them and when they had called them about my policy, apparently my insurance covered even less than they thought and so I ""owed $900 more"". Obviously I didn't have my policy right onhand then and felt overwhelmed so I just gave my credit card while I thought I'd figure it out.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, why did it take over a year for them to notice? Is this on me to owe or should it really be a dispute between them? I was pretty annoyed because if I had known earlier I could have at least put it in my HSA in November to avoid taxes on a medical related expense and am not sure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I signed the citation which says that I'm not admitting guilt but I am agreeing to appear in court in the next 12 days. It also says that I'm able to plea guilty by mail which I think I should probably do because I was speeding. 

I just don't know if it's better to pay the fine and probably have my insurance rate go up too or appear in court and try to fight it because they don't really have any proof unless they're able to check any cameras.

The officer who pulled me over wasn&amp;#39;t using radar or anything; he was just driving on the highway as well. I&amp;#39;m sure I was probably speeding. Probably about 85 in a 65 but I&amp;#39;m not sure and he doesn&amp;#39;t know either I&amp;#39;m assuming because he wasn&amp;#39;t using radar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I signed the citation which says that I&amp;#39;m not admitting guilt but I am agreeing to appear in court in the next 12 days. It also says that I&amp;#39;m able to plea guilty by mail which I think I should probably do because I was speeding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s better to pay the fine and probably have my insurance rate go up too or appear in court and try to fight it because they don&amp;#39;t really have any proof unless they&amp;#39;re able to check any cameras. &lt;/p&gt;

I work for a county sheriff's office and we keep track of our hours worked via paper time sheets that we turn in at the end of every pay cycle. We also have an electronic employee portal which shows us our pay information, hours worked, deductions, etc. We work 25-day pay cycles consisting of 150 hours worked within the 25 days, however, we are paid the same amount regardless of hours worked on the last day of each month; overtime hours are paid in the form of ""comp time.""

&amp;#x200B;

The employee pay portal shows the pay period for each paycheck (direct deposit) as starting on the 16 of each month and ending on the last day and shows the hours worked for each pay period as 173.33, which in no way lines up with any time sheet I turn in, nor my actual pay. The portal also shows I have an hourly rate of 20.86, and I was told my pay is 43,392.00/year when I got promoted, which lines up with 20.86/hour, 173.33 hours a month, and 12 months a year. I work a 10-hour schedule, and will work 218 days this year, which is 2180 hours; 173.33 hours a month is only accounting for 2,079 hours worked, which means I'm working an additional 100 hours for free, or I'm being underpaid.  Several other employees have approached me about this, and I've observed a similar discrepancy in their pay.

&amp;#x200B;

We do not have an HR department, and I'd be hesitant to bring this to the administration as some of the administrators just under the sheriff can be petty/retaliatory, and it'd have to go through them to reach the sheriff. I'm not even sure if it's legal or not, or maybe I'm just missing something. If it's illegal, who could I talk to outside of my department, and what are some of the results I could expect?

In or around 1996- my maternal grandfather- Joe had a stroke. His name was on all properties he owned, his wife, my maternal grandmother Eunice was his immediate heir otherwise. He had three children- (Byron- a Boy- Youngest), (Elizabeth- my mom and middle child), and Ashley(eldest- female).

At the time of the stroke in 1996, he basically divided up his physical properties- he wanted his house to be safe because he trusted my mother and he put mom(Elizabeth's) name on the house so Ashley could not use it to stick himself or his wife Eunice in a nursing home.

In 1996, the house and the 8 acres it was on was split between my mom(Elizabeth) and her sister Ashley. In addition, Grandpa Joe also left 24 acres to myself, my sister, and my mother Elizabeth. The remainder of the real estate was to be given to Ashley and Byron when Joe and Eunice died(grandpa and grandma).

Come 2011, Grandpa Joe has a stroke- he died. Grandma Eunice had lost all control of her faculties. By 2013 Grandma Eunice was dead. My aunt Ashley claimed to be the executor, my mom wanted no fights, no ugliness and just left Ashley and Byron to feast on the estate. My mom even signed an agreement to give her sister my grandmothers' house and 8 acres for a right of way to access the property. Her sister made a photocopy of the quit claim to a right of way and illegally duped my mom into signing off her interest in grandma and granpa's house and 8 acres to get a right of way to our 24 acres. We've been told that if we were rich, we could sue, otherwise the fraud stands and there is nothing we can do about it(that came from a magistrate).

We still owned 24 acres that my mom, my sister, myself had receieved 24 acres when Joe first became sick in 1996. My grandpa had access to the land since the 1960's. Ownership of the the road isn’t on that deed- ownership of the road isn’t listed on the property that is across from ours owned by the Turners.

This has been a road in place for 50+ years- it is documented on the plats and referred to as Turner Lane. At the end of Turner lane, a family of Serb origin, Kuntcs, own a property that is there.

After a couple years of my grandparents being dead, my sister and I wanted no part of the land, as we felt it was my mother's- we signed off on a deed saying it is my mother's, in the register of deed's she is sole owner. My mom went to sell the property last year and the people making offers on it kept contending it was landlocked.

The road that runs by the property is listed on deeds from 50 years ago as being a boundary to my mom's property, my uncle's, my aunt's, and the Kuntcs as well as other properties. It is also how my uncle accesses his house he illegally built(he built an entire home with no permits and then ran electrical service from my grandmother's old house himself above ground), the Kuntcs use it to get to their property. It also is beside the Turner

My mom wanted to get an easement on writing so no one could complain if we offered it for sale in the future that the land could not be claimed to be land locked. She went to an attorney, the attorney said $10k.

The road is listed as being there in Georgia for 50+ years, it is the only thing that keeps it from being landlocked.

I feel at the least my grandfather had an implied easement, he accessed it for 50+ years,  when we got the 24acres in 1996, we accessed the property via the road all during this time. It's the only way in or out to the property.

It is not clear who owns the road, the county has done as minimal work to it as possible.

My questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Roads been there 50+ years, grandpa used it to access  his farm until he died 2011, my mom and dad used it since 1996 to check  our property for neccessary upkeep. I would argue that grandpa had an   implied easement. He was allowed to use it for 50+ years- there is no deed   anywhere that says X name owns the road. Just it is listed on plats that show maps as being an existing ""Turner Lane""
2. Why did we not inherit the 50+ year implied easement      when he deeded the 24 acres to use ? The way the transaction happened was      he had a deed for a property that was 24 acres, he signed it off as a gift      in 1996 to my mom, my sister, myself. After granddad died and my      grandmother became mentally unstable, my sister and I signed off on our      interests to mom. Same deed as written, we just quit claimed it to my mom.      Why is there no implied easement here ? The road is not clearly delineated      as county or private, as the county did do upkeep in the past.
3. The Yonce/Turner family that own property next to the road have never told us not to use it and their deed doesn't actually say they own it, just the road is a boundary on their plat- their plat deed specifies it is bounded to the road, our deed says bounded by the road.
4. The only attempt to stop our use was when my dirtbag uncle parked a tractor in the road, a magistrate ordered him off.

Should a lawsuit to get this easement in writing cost $10k or more ? Should we seek a second legal opinion ?

&amp;#x200B;

Reason I ask is, the attorney my elderly folks went to see has a habit of suggesting what he refers to as ""Solomonic Law""- when we had a problem with people illegally grazing their cattle on the property, he told them that the thing King Solomon would do is put up a fence to keep the other people's cattle off(ie not expect the other people to put up their own fence to control their own cattle- my mother bare the expense).  He's  a flake, I know he thinks the property is valuable because he is aware it came close to selling for $225k for 24acres, so I think there are some moral hazard issues there. Also his solution for ""Solomonic Law"" was that we maintain the entire road for 7 years, improve it, and then try to take extra property that is next to the road via adverse possession- which to me is just nuts.

My mom wants to sell this property, she wants to never have anything to do with her brother or sister, and we don't want any legal repercussions from selling it. She doesn't feel like it will sell if landlocked. There is an attorney in the area that has represented my moms' brother in his numberous shady affairs and she represented the last potential buyer on the property, and she told so many lies it isn't funny(she is the one who came up with the land locked business).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think it is land locked- no one owns the road. My mom just wants to sell it, not have to pay the extremely high millage rate, and say screw it, it's over with. Any suggestions on how to most efficiently deal with this road so that she can sell the property ? Should I call DOT and see if because they've scraped it, it is a public road ?

&amp;#x200B;

Any other thoughts or suggestions are appreciated. Thank you for your time and reading.

My father is dying of cancer and probably won't make it to fall. 

For years upon years he has always said that he would be leaving the house to my brother and I (both now 32). He got a girlfriend about six years ago, who is now caring for him fulltime while I have moved across the country to offer additional help with yardwork, groceries, and the like. 

So anyways he randomly married the woman two days ago. At his house. No one knew about it and I only found out yesterday when I showed up and he had a ring on. Then today they asked me to run a quick errand, I'm gone no more than twenty minutes and I come back to see a notary leaving. Evidently my father, who has been on SSI for disability and is riddled with tumors--is not filing to adopt his girlfriend's 7yo, who she doesn't even have custody of. 

As far as I know his plan to leave my brother and I remains the same, only. Ow he has added the child onto it, in addition to his girlfriend being allowed to live there as long as she wants. 

What is going to happen? Now that she is legally his spouse does she have the authority to change that? I feel like I am going to end up losing everything that my father wanted to leave to me, which is really this plot of land on a cul de sac where all of my family live.

Hi I am dee and live in england

To start I won't share where I work out of fear of losing my job.

I was at work on the over night shift on Sunday (30/06/19) to Monday (1/06/19) and about 1.40 am I went on my break and found out my wallet and phone were missing. There is a faulty lock on the staffroom door and the camera freezes during that time that someone could have come through the back. This has happened 4 times now including me and each time the camera has frozen.

I just think it's all really suspicious and I think there might be a case in there somewhere due to the camera not working and there not being a proper lock on the door.

Does anyone know if there is anything I can do as I am so scared to go back to work incase they come back.....

I live in Houston Texas, if that helps anyone. 
I am a renter, without renter's insurance. 
Last Sunday we had a carbon monoxide leak, and so we called the gas company. They came out right away and did their job well, they turned off the gas, and said the stove was definitely the culprit. So he labeled that, the gas meter and the hot water heater as do not use. He gave us some paper work to give to the landlord, etc. 
So in the morning we called the landlord to let him and his wife know. Well it didn't go over so well. He started telling my husband to never call the gas company for any reason, and handed the phone off to his wife, who historically has some serious issues with any kind of repairs or anything. She started screaming at my husband, like really screaming telling us we were scamming her, and didn't we like having a place to live, and telling us we could get evicted because she wants us to get evicted. She said there is a waiting list and she could have us out in a heartbeat. Never call the gas company, always call us first, don't call anyone outside of us, stuff like that. She tells him she doesn't care if we don't have hot water or a stove, she says she's taking the stove and giving it to someone who won't complain. On top of that, she is not replacing the stove.
So we immediately make copies of the paperwork before she comes over to get them. When she does she starts asking us if we even like living here and why we would do this to her (?). I let her know that she was lucky we called the gas company when we did otherwise we may have gone to sleep and she'd be clearing out bodies, one of which a four year old, today instead of collecting paperwork. I know, dramatic, but it made her be quiet for a second. 
So the next day she makes an appointment with a plumber and he comes over, does a great job but doesn't finish. The whole time she is texting us abusive things. Things like  this is our fault, and we need to take care of it ourselves, etc. I spoke to some of the neighbors and on either side of us, as she owns these houses. The one neighbor said the last people that lived in this house sued her for mold exposure, and won. Apparently it flooded and they were exposed to mold, ended up in the hospital and sued her for refusing repairs. Which explains why the attic smells like mold and why the bathroom ceiling is caving in, and why she has been ignoring my texts about it... 
Then the horror stories start with my neighbors, flood damage, refusing repairs, not having heat in the winter, refusing to cut trees down, the roof on one side is open to the air and has needed to be repaired since Harvey. Raising rent periodically with no warning. 
So now to the advice part. We still have 6 Months on this lease but I want to leave. Now. I don't want to be here for the roof caving in on the bathroom or anything else where we might need something from them. My four year old son lives here, so i have to worry about his safety first, and this was a huge red flag. They had zero concern for our safety. What should we do, do I have some kind of a case here? Or should I contact a lawyer asking for a letter drafted asking to be released from the lease? I didn't expect any of this, and my thoughts are jumbled so I apologize if this is all over the place. I don't know what is possible and what isn't in terms of Texas law.
They are supposed to come back today and I am nervous AF. Let me know what anyone thinks of all this. Any information is appreciated!!


UPDATE: they were supposed to come back today, but I called the plumber directly and he said he was told Friday or Monday. Which means we will have been without hot water and a stove for over a week.

It is located in a suburb of a major metropolitan area in Alabama, which I'll call Smallville. Before buying, while the realtor and I were looking at various houses, I emphasized repeatedly that I refused to buy a house in any area that was covered by mandatory covenants of any Homeowner's Association (HOA). I have several emails to her where I have documented this requirement, and at least one email from her acknowledging that she is aware that I insist upon this and she agrees not to show me any houses that are covered by any HOA. 

So we found a very nice house in Smallville that was near, but she assured me not, in the same neighborhood as one subject to a HOA, which I'll call ""Shysterlawn"". At closing, I specifically asked her and the lawyer whether they were sure that the house was not in Shysterlawn or subject to any other HOA. The lawyer said she didn't know, but the realtor assured me that it was not. I made an audio recording of the entire closing, which documents this. The realtor and lawyer acknowledged verbally, at the beginning of the recording, that they were aware they were being recorded and they gave me their permission to do so. (The seller was not present at my closing. Apparently, he did his part of the closing just before or after I did mine. I have never met him.) 

I verified, verbally by asking the lawyer and realtor, and by reading it myself in detail before I signed it, that there was no language in my purchase contract that subjected me to the authority of any HOA. (I found out later that the Shysterlawn HOA covenants required the seller to put language into the contract that obligated the buyer to agree that this house was under the authority of the HOA. This was not done.) I have copies of everything that I signed. There is simply no language in my buyer's contract that says anything about any HOA. 

I had just sold my old house, so I paid cash. (Certified check? I think, maybe wire transfer? I don't recall. Anyway, there was no mortgage, although I did buy Title Insurance.) 

A year has passed since I moved in, and I have made about $50,000 in improvements to the house. Nothing radical, just repainted the outside with a different, neutral color, added a large front porch, etc. 

Last week, I received a letter from the Shysterlawn Homeowner's Association informing me that they were putting a $20,000 lien on my house because of my ""unapproved modifications"" and my non-payment of membership fees. This is the first I'd heard from them. 

I talked with the neighbors, who confirmed that their houses were all in the Shysterlawn HOA and that the former owner knew that his house was in the HOA. In fact, the previous owner had had numerous conflicts with the HOA and told several of my neighbors that it was a major reason why he sold the house. 

I then met with a person at the Shysterlawn HOA. This is a large HOA with over 1,000 houses in the neighborhood, and is about 20 years old. 

He claimed that, until about a month ago, the HOA was unaware that the previous owner had sold the house, so all of their warning letters were forwarded to him. (At an address that is no longer valid. Nobody knows where he is.) That's why I didn't get any warning. Apparently, they are pursuing some legal action against him that they would not discuss with me. 

Once they discovered that I was the new owner, they sent someone who photographed my changes to my home, and based my lien on that. The person at the HOA was adamant that my $20,000 lien was because of my modifications and my non-payment of HOA dues, and had nothing to do with the previous owner. 

I then informed him that my purchase contract did not say anything about any HOA, so that I was not obligated to follow any of its rules, nor did they have any authority to place a lien on my house. He quickly became angry and accused me of lying. The situation deteriorated rapidly from there, so I suggested that he get a copy of my contract from my realtor, then I left. Yes, I secretly made an audio recording of the entire meeting. (This is legal in Alabama.)

(BTW, the Shysterlawn HOA has a reputation for being enormous a**holes, much worse than the other HOA's in this metro area. All of my neighbors hate the HOA, because it is very nit-picky and does not hesitate to take legal action against its own members, who consider much of the HOA's behavior to be absolute harassment. This is probably because the HOA is still mostly controlled by the guy who built the neighborhood 20 years ago. There are lots of rumors about him lining his own pockets with HOA funds, but I don't have any proof and that's not relevant to my current situation, so I won't discuss it here.)

I called the realtor, who told me that it was ""not her responsibility to know if a particular house is in an HOA"", and that she ""can't do anything about it"", so I ""had better talk real nice to the HOA and see if I can work out something"". I escalated to her boss, the owner of the realty agency, who told me about the same thing. I secretly made an audio recording of each of these conversations. 

In the past year, based on the number of her ""For Sale"" signs in people's yards, and current listings available online, this realtor has personally sold several houses in Shysterlawn, and currently has several for sale there, subject to the same HOA. According to her online bio, she has over 10 years experience as a realtor in the Smallville area. It is simply inconceivable that she did not know that my house was in the Shysterlawn HOA.

So she and her agency were responsible for the MLS listing. It does not mention the Shysterlawn neighborhood by name. If it had said, ""Nice house in Shysterlawn neighborhood"", I would have guessed that the house was subject to the HOA, but all it says, is ""Nice house in Smallville"", so there was no indication that it was in the neighborhood that is covered by the Shysterlawn HOA. 

I know I need a lawyer, but I am new in town and I don't know anyone. A friend recommended one, and we have an appointment for next week. I've never met this lawyer and I want to be as prepared as I can be before the meeting, just so that I can be sure that she knows what she's doing.

Here's what I want: I refuse to be subjected to the authority of this or any other HOA, and I simply want the HOA to acknowledge that they have no legal right to make me do anything. (1) Ideally, I'd like to stay in this house, so long as I don't have any HOA associated with it. In this case, the realtor would compensate me for any expenses I have related to convincing the HOA to leave me alone, clearing the lien, my legal fees, etc. (2) If I do have to move, then I want the realtor to compensate me enough to pay off the lien and other expenses imposed by the HOA, any loss that I incur from having to sell a house that I have made many improvements to, sales expenses, moving expenses, legal fees and all of my other expenses associated with my having to sell &amp; move. 

I don't want to have to try to deal with the previous owner, because nobody can find him. Some of my neighbors think that he has left the country.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alabama, USA - About a year ago, I bought a house for about $300,000. It is located in a suburb of a major metropolitan area in Alabama, which I&amp;#39;ll call Smallville. Before buying, while the realtor and I were looking at various houses, I emphasized repeatedly that I refused to buy a house in any area that was covered by mandatory covenants of any Homeowner&amp;#39;s Association (HOA). I have several emails to her where I have documented this requirement, and at least one email from her acknowledging that she is aware that I insist upon this and she agrees not to show me any houses that are covered by any HOA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we found a very nice house in Smallville that was near, but she assured me not, in the same neighborhood as one subject to a HOA, which I&amp;#39;ll call &amp;quot;Shysterlawn&amp;quot;. At closing, I specifically asked her and the lawyer whether they were sure that the house was not in Shysterlawn or subject to any other HOA. The lawyer said she didn&amp;#39;t know, but the realtor assured me that it was not. I made an audio recording of the entire closing, which documents this. The realtor and lawyer acknowledged verbally, at the beginning of the recording, that they were aware they were being recorded and they gave me their permission to do so. (The seller was not present at my closing. Apparently, he did his part of the closing just before or after I did mine. I have never met him.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I verified, verbally by asking the lawyer and realtor, and by reading it myself in detail before I signed it, that there was no language in my purchase contract that subjected me to the authority of any HOA. (I found out later that the Shysterlawn HOA covenants required the seller to put language into the contract that obligated the buyer to agree that this house was under the authority of the HOA. This was not done.) I have copies of everything that I signed. There is simply no language in my buyer&amp;#39;s contract that says anything about any HOA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just sold my old house, so I paid cash. (Certified check? I think, maybe wire transfer? I don&amp;#39;t recall. Anyway, there was no mortgage, although I did buy Title Insurance.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year has passed since I moved in, and I have made about $50,000 in improvements to the house. Nothing radical, just repainted the outside with a different, neutral color, added a large front porch, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I received a letter from the Shysterlawn Homeowner&amp;#39;s Association informing me that they were putting a $20,000 lien on my house because of my &amp;quot;unapproved modifications&amp;quot; and my non-payment of membership fees. This is the first I&amp;#39;d heard from them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I talked with the neighbors, who confirmed that their houses were all in the Shysterlawn HOA and that the former owner knew that his house was in the HOA. In fact, the previous owner had had numerous conflicts with the HOA and told several of my neighbors that it was a major reason why he sold the house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then met with a person at the Shysterlawn HOA. This is a large HOA with over 1,000 houses in the neighborhood, and is about 20 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He claimed that, until about a month ago, the HOA was unaware that the previous owner had sold the house, so all of their warning letters were forwarded to him. (At an address that is no longer valid. Nobody knows where he is.) That&amp;#39;s why I didn&amp;#39;t get any warning. Apparently, they are pursuing some legal action against him that they would not discuss with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they discovered that I was the new owner, they sent someone who photographed my changes to my home, and based my lien on that. The person at the HOA was adamant that my $20,000 lien was because of my modifications and my non-payment of HOA dues, and had nothing to do with the previous owner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then informed him that my purchase contract did not say anything about any HOA, so that I was not obligated to follow any of its rules, nor did they have any authority to place a lien on my house. He quickly became angry and accused me of lying. The situation deteriorated rapidly from there, so I suggested that he get a copy of my contract from my realtor, then I left. Yes, I secretly made an audio recording of the entire meeting. (This is legal in Alabama.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(BTW, the Shysterlawn HOA has a reputation for being enormous a**holes, much worse than the other HOA&amp;#39;s in this metro area. All of my neighbors hate the HOA, because it is very nit-picky and does not hesitate to take legal action against its own members, who consider much of the HOA&amp;#39;s behavior to be absolute harassment. This is probably because the HOA is still mostly controlled by the guy who built the neighborhood 20 years ago. There are lots of rumors about him lining his own pockets with HOA funds, but I don&amp;#39;t have any proof and that&amp;#39;s not relevant to my current situation, so I won&amp;#39;t discuss it here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called the realtor, who told me that it was &amp;quot;not her responsibility to know if a particular house is in an HOA&amp;quot;, and that she &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t do anything about it&amp;quot;, so I &amp;quot;had better talk real nice to the HOA and see if I can work out something&amp;quot;. I escalated to her boss, the owner of the realty agency, who told me about the same thing. I secretly made an audio recording of each of these conversations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past year, based on the number of her &amp;quot;For Sale&amp;quot; signs in people&amp;#39;s yards, and current listings available online, this realtor has personally sold several houses in Shysterlawn, and currently has several for sale there, subject to the same HOA. According to her online bio, she has over 10 years experience as a realtor in the Smallville area. It is simply inconceivable that she did not know that my house was in the Shysterlawn HOA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also reviewed the year-old MLS printout, that I had in my files, that described the house before I bought it. The agent that I used to buy the house was also the agent for the seller. So she and her agency were responsible for the MLS listing. It does not mention the Shysterlawn neighborhood by name. If it had said, &amp;quot;Nice house in Shysterlawn neighborhood&amp;quot;, I would have guessed that the house was subject to the HOA, but all it says, is &amp;quot;Nice house in Smallville&amp;quot;, so there was no indication that it was in the neighborhood that is covered by the Shysterlawn HOA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I need a lawyer, but I am new in town and I don&amp;#39;t know anyone. A friend recommended one, and we have an appointment for next week. I&amp;#39;ve never met this lawyer and I want to be as prepared as I can be before the meeting, just so that I can be sure that she knows what she&amp;#39;s doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I want: I refuse to be subjected to the authority of this or any other HOA, and I simply want the HOA to acknowledge that they have no legal right to make me do anything. (1) Ideally, I&amp;#39;d like to stay in this house, so long as I don&amp;#39;t have any HOA associated with it.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to have to try to deal with the previous owner, because nobody can find him. Some of my neighbors think that he has left the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice will be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Not that sure how to start this off but ill go to when it first started. I was 17 when i first started working at a restaurant, they had been open for a long time but the staff had started to leave/quit and so I was hired. I had been there for about 5 months when they hired a new waiter. He was extremely disrespectful as soon as he came in, calling me &amp; other waitresses bitches and etc. After about 2ish months of him working he started to make sexual jokes to me *a 17 year old* I told him to stop as it made me uncomfortable and instead of stopping he continuously did it &amp; when I ignored him he would instead make fun of my weight &amp; call me ugly. I told my boss &amp; my manager several times after he started and was only met with the response ""Just ignore him"". I tried very hard to but eventually i couldnt handle it anymore and quit. It has now been 6 months since then and I have started working there again. I assumed he no longer worked there because of the amount of complaints he had &amp; the lack of work he did. I had also no seem him in a while. Yesterday was my first day back and as soon as I walked into the kitchen to start the day he immediately started with ""Aw I missed you let me give you a kiss"" and tried to forcefully kiss me. I pushed him away and he just laughed at me. A few minutes later he told me to call him ""Big Daddy"" at that point I was beyond disgusted and just went somewhere else until it was time to open. About 2 minutes before we opened he came into the front and started talking to the host, when he saw I was there he made a comment in which he said ""You would look good as a prostitute, I would buy you"" I was extremely shocked. I was going to say something back but the customers came in and I didnt want to make a scene, but he didnt care if customers were inside and within hearing distance because he then proceeded to tell me I should start to do pole-dancing and that if I did he would like to see. I refused and walked away, only to be stopped by him trying to give me a pen, but not only did he try to give it back to me the way he tried to give it back to me was disgusting. He proceeded to try to shove a pen between my cleavage. When I slapped his hand away he said that he was just doing it for ""safe keeping"". Fast forward to a few hours into being open. He is right in front of me and is blocking the way into the kitchen so I ask him to please move as I have customers waiting. He refuses, I try to go by him and he moves but when Im slightly pass him he shoves me as hard as he can into the drink machine. Our manager is looking at him while he does this and just laughs at him and walks away. I again do nothing. I go back into the front after a small while and wait there, he walks up to me and just stares and me so i say ""what?"" And he says nothing and continues to stare. I just decide to ignore him and look forward. As a way to get my attention he decides to punch me in the arm. When I turn to look at him he does it again &amp; again. I have to use my tray to have him stop hitting my arm. I say ""If you keep this up Im going to report you."" His response is ""If you report me im going to kill you and your family."" (This is nothing more than an empty threat but he said it so seriously that I got scared.)

&amp;#x200B;

I rented a furnished house in Quebec, Canada for about 8 months.

I have pictures from the day I moved out that don't show any damage, and she sent me pictures recently that show damage. Additionally she also had a cat when she lived in the house. I never actually used the basement couch during my stay. The damage is all cosmetic and, in my mind, doesn't warrant replacement of the couch, but she is demanding that I pay the full cost. I told her that I wouldn't pay, and now she said that if she doesn't receive payment that I will hear from her lawyer.

I looked over the lease agreement and there is only one couch listed on the lease, but the couch shown to me before renting was the upstairs couch rather than the one downstairs. There was no damage deposit for this lease. She is demanding $600CAD for replacement. Am I legally responsible for the damage to the couch?

It had a relatively clean carfax report (a couple of accidents from hitting deer). The car still has its original Nissan Warranty which is good until 2021. We also purchased an extended warranty after the 2021 warranty ended. We also purchased an after market remote start from the dealership (Which was installed by their preferred installer). 

 Now the issue ended up being that within a month or two the car would not start. The battery seemed to die. Not thinking much about it We just jump started the car and went on our business. This happened a couple times over the next couple of weeks. Fed up with it my girlfriend finally took the car into the Dealerships service department. We ended up jump starting the car to get it over to the dealership. They ran their tests but found that they couldn't figure out the issue. So they gave the car back to us. Roughly a month later the car Died again, so again we jump started the car and took it to the dealership. This time they figured that it was a bad battery. The battery that came with the car was less than a year old and still under its own warranty. They talked her into buying a Nissan approved battery and having it installed. then gave the car back to us. A few weeks later the car died again. So we jumped the car and took it into the dealership again. This time they said it had to be the remote start, So they took it out and charged us for the labor on that (Found out later from the sales team that the remote start was under warranty and it should have been looked at free of charge).  Then they gave the car back to us.

Roughly a month later after taking the remote start out, the car once again died. This time instead of jump starting the car and taking it in we opted for getting the non-starting car towed to the dealership. They ran their tests and then determined that there was ""Something"" drawing from the battery but they couldn't quite figure it out. So they held onto the car for a week or so then gave it back to us since it was starting for them again. A few weeks later the car died once again. Got the car towed to the dealership and they narrowed it down to probably being one of four things having to do with the car's computer. But conveniently it wouldn't be covered by the Nissan warranty because they cant ""confirm exactly"" which part was bad, So they tried to say we would have to pay for it. 

Now that wasn't going to fly so we contacted the sales guy about this and to his credit, took it upon himself to go over to the service department and saying that the dealership is just going to eat the cost of replacing the part if the Nissan warranty won't cover it. We had been keeping him up to date whenever we took the car into the shop. So they replaced the first part. 

We settled in expecting it to be a similar issue but eventually we'd get all the potentially ""problem"" parts replaced. Like clock work 3-4 weeks later the car wouldn't start. We got the car towed to the service center and left it to them to replace the next part. Currently the car has been there for 3 weeks as they ran their ""Tests"" and the car starts. After talking to them they pretty much got it to start then left it to sit to see if it wouldn't start after a time. Well sure enough apparently the car is still starting just fine. So they're going to give us the car back. 

So after about the 3rd or 4th time we've had it in the shop I started getting frustrated by the whole situation, and started looking into Wisconsin's Lemon law. I'm not overly sure if Wisconsin covers used vehicles in their lemon law. But we're going into the dealership to talk with the sales guys to see if there is a possibility that they will work with us to replace the car. I'm not holding much hope with that but I figured it's worth a try since the sales team has been pretty helpful so far. 

So the help that I'm looking for is, What steps should I take if (and most likely) the Dealership refuses to swap the car for a different one. We've been keeping track of all the times that the car has been in the shop and the work that's been done. Thanks for the time and any help.

tldr- Bought a used car from a dealership, Took it into their service shop 6 times because it wouldn't start. Looking for pointers about how to go about evoking Wisconsin's lemon law","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So back in September 2018 my girlfriend bought a Used 2014 Nissan from a local Nissan dealership. It had a relatively clean carfax report (a couple of accidents from hitting deer). The car still has its original Nissan Warranty which is good until 2021. We also purchased an extended warranty after the 2021 warranty ended. We also purchased an after market remote start from the dealership (Which was installed by their preferred installer). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the issue ended up being that within a month or two the car would not start. The battery seemed to die. Not thinking much about it We just jump started the car and went on our business. This happened a couple times over the next couple of weeks. Fed up with it my girlfriend finally took the car into the Dealerships service department. We ended up jump starting the car to get it over to the dealership. They ran their tests but found that they couldn&amp;#39;t figure out the issue. So they gave the car back to us. Roughly a month later the car Died again, so again we jump started the car and took it to the dealership. This time they figured that it was a bad battery. The battery that came with the car was less than a year old and still under its own warranty. They talked her into buying a Nissan approved battery and having it installed. then gave the car back to us. A few weeks later the car died again. So we jumped the car and took it into the dealership again. This time they said it had to be the remote start, So they took it out and charged us for the labor on that (Found out later from the sales team that the remote start was under warranty and it should have been looked at free of charge).  Then they gave the car back to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly a month later after taking the remote start out, the car once again died. This time instead of jump starting the car and taking it in we opted for getting the non-starting car towed to the dealership. They ran their tests and then determined that there was &amp;quot;Something&amp;quot; drawing from the battery but they couldn&amp;#39;t quite figure it out. So they held onto the car for a week or so then gave it back to us since it was starting for them again. A few weeks later the car died once again. Got the car towed to the dealership and they narrowed it down to probably being one of four things having to do with the car&amp;#39;s computer. But conveniently it wouldn&amp;#39;t be covered by the Nissan warranty because they cant &amp;quot;confirm exactly&amp;quot; which part was bad, So they tried to say we would have to pay for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that wasn&amp;#39;t going to fly so we contacted the sales guy about this and to his credit, took it upon himself to go over to the service department and saying that the dealership is just going to eat the cost of replacing the part if the Nissan warranty won&amp;#39;t cover it. We had been keeping him up to date whenever we took the car into the shop. So they replaced the first part. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We settled in expecting it to be a similar issue but eventually we&amp;#39;d get all the potentially &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; parts replaced. Like clock work 3-4 weeks later the car wouldn&amp;#39;t start. We got the car towed to the service center and left it to them to replace the next part. Currently the car has been there for 3 weeks as they ran their &amp;quot;Tests&amp;quot; and the car starts. After talking to them they pretty much got it to start then left it to sit to see if it wouldn&amp;#39;t start after a time. Well sure enough apparently the car is still starting just fine. So they&amp;#39;re going to give us the car back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after about the 3rd or 4th time we&amp;#39;ve had it in the shop I started getting frustrated by the whole situation, and started looking into Wisconsin&amp;#39;s Lemon law. I&amp;#39;m not overly sure if Wisconsin covers used vehicles in their lemon law. But we&amp;#39;re going into the dealership to talk with the sales guys to see if there is a possibility that they will work with us to replace the car. I&amp;#39;m not holding much hope with that but I figured it&amp;#39;s worth a try since the sales team has been pretty helpful so far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the help that I&amp;#39;m looking for is, What steps should I take if (and most likely) the Dealership refuses to swap the car for a different one. We&amp;#39;ve been keeping track of all the times that the car has been in the shop and the work that&amp;#39;s been done. Thanks for the time and any help.&lt;/p&gt;
