We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Find and participate in a FREE activity in your area!**  Some suggestions on how to do this:

* Search your [local community subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocationReddits/wiki/index), website, or newsletter for free activities.  These can range from free days at a local museum to free concerts in the park.

 * If you happen to live in or near a mid-sized or large city, check the local subreddit to see what type of events and meet-ups have been listed (also make sure you check their sidebar).

 * Bulletin boards at community centers, places of worship, and schools are also good places to find different activities.

* Visit a local or national park and have a picnic, go for a hike, or walk a nature trail.

* Check out some of the ""free to play"" type activities that are available all over the world.  

 * Make a ""walk in the park"" more exciting with /r/geocaching.

 * See if there is a podcast/map for a historic walking tour of your town or a nearby town, download it, and make a morning or afternoon of walking the tour.

* Set-up and run a game night or movie night with your friends.  Rather than go out for expensive fun at a bar or restaurant, stay home and have more fun with friends.  /r/boardgames has a helpful sidebar, /r/NetflixBestOf has lots of movie suggestions, and you can always ask your friends for ideas.

* Meet up with some friends in a local park for a picnic, barbecue, to play basketball or tennis, or maybe just to toss a football or frisbee around.

* Large celebrations: National holidays like the Fourth of July or local ""Heritage Weekends"" tend to have many options for free entertainment throughout town.  Check out when the next one around you is happening (hint: Fourth of July if you live in the United States).

* Volunteer for free admission.  Many events will need help with everything from ushers to clean-up and will usually allow you free admission to the event as a reward for volunteering.  Find a cause you believe in or an event you want see and see about volunteer opportunities.

  Check out [VolunteerMatch.org](http://www.VolunteerMatch.org) to see some of the endless opportunities around you.

The goal of this exercise is to show you that spending money isn’t required to have a full and healthy life.

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done one or more of the following things:

* Participated in 2 different activities around your town.

* Setup or joined an on-going activity (like a game night with friends).

I live in SoCal with my wife. We’re currently renting a 1 bedroom for $1800. 

We would love to purchase a home, but the cost of living here in Los Angeles as you know is very high. 

A property that would interest us runs around $8-850k. Needless to say that’s a major commitment, and outgo increase. 

Truth be told, we have no issues renting for now. Our goal is to save 2-300k for a big down payment but that will take a few years of saving. Again, rent is at $1800. If we purchase, our outgo will go up to around $4-5k all in (mortgage, insurance, property tax, etc). 

Now, after doing some research and I found out that we can invest in a smaller apartment complex in Fresno, California. It’s a 4 unit complex with each unit at 2bed 2bath for $590k. The outgo there will run around $2500 - $3000 after our down. Keeping in mind the rent collected should cover the outgo. 

I’m stuck... I don’t know what the better financial move is. Anyone with advice? I would really appreciate it.

Here’s my story- I am currently going to school part time this summer before I start Nursing in the Fall. The school I attend is a 20 min drive and I have to make that 4x a week. I currently work in a medical office full time (till the Fall) and make about $2200 a month. I recently found out I can’t keep my position while doing school and I’ll be switching to an on call/part time nursing support job that’ll give me the flexibility I need while in nursing school, but will be a big pay cut since I won’t be working 40 hours at the same rate any longer ($16 hr currently). I was told my other position will probably only be around $13hr and anywhere between 8-30hrs depending on what I can work. I’m also living at home while I get on my feet but I have a lot of credit card debt from a few years ago that I haven’t paid off. Because I don’t make much I haven’t been able to pay it off as originally planned. Several years ago I worked in sales and was flourishing financially, but depression and overall unhappiness in that line of work pushed me out of that field. So all the spoils of that lifestyle are haunting me...mainly my high car payment and the monthly payments I’m making on the cards. I have a SMALL amount of financial aid and student loans saved, about $1800 now and $1500 during the Fall semester. I was hoping those would be a buffer for the expense of driving to class 4x a week and supplementing my pay cut but I’m feeling like I’m about to drown right as I’m on the cusp of accomplishing this huge goal. The icing on the cake is that about 10 years ago I wasted 3 years in college at a university not knowing what I wanted to do and now I’m maxed out on loans. Probably about $50k. I get enough in financial aid awards to cover my tuition, but nothing is left over. I cringe typing this...I’m embarrassed and ashamed. Now I’m at the point where i can’t take out anymore student loans and I have to ask myself, do I let the car go...get something cheap? Do I stop making payments on the cards? I’ve always made my payments on time! Never been late. My credit score is pretty good actually! Probably lower now than ever but has always been in the 700s. I figure I could let my credit suffer for now and work on fixing it when I’m out of school, but I don’t know if that’s the smartest choice. I’m a single Mom and I want nothing more than to give my child every opportunity she deserves. Right now my Family is helping in every way they can and I feel terrible...I’ve gotten myself into a bind but I’m not giving up on my career.  Right now I have about 4 cards I pay on which equal about $450/mo and my vehicle payment is $695/mo.

I’m a single Mom and I want nothing more than to give my child every opportunity she deserves. Right now my Family is helping in every way they can and I feel terrible...I’ve gotten myself into a bind but I’m not giving up on my career.  Right now I have about 4 cards I pay on which equal about $450/mo and my vehicle payment is $695/mo. The only other expenses I have since I’m living with my Family are gas, food and things here and there for my child.&lt;/p&gt;

I try and save as much as possible but it is already a small amount and the majority of it goes towards paying for things my daughter needs, childcare, etc. I will be working as a CNA to get my foot in the door at the hospital I want to work at once I graduate, just because it is so competitive. One advantage of this is that I will be able to save whatever undetermined amount I make there.I can only guess, but once I graduate I will be making about $54k-$60k per year and will still live with my parents for a little while.I don't currently know my credit score (I know I should have sorted that out before coming on here, sorry!) but I do know that if it is even existent, it likely isn't very good since my ex left me with the debt of closing expenses for my apartment ($2600) and bills he used my name for without my permission that he told me he paid, which I just found out he did not pay ($2000).

Even though I do have a little debt hanging over me, I am very grateful to be in the position that I am and eventually able to save my money. My parents kindness has definitely presented a lot of opportunity for me to create a good life for my daughter and I, especially financially. I just want to make the most out of this and set myself up for a successful future.

My biggest goal in the next 5 years is to own a home. It would be great to move from my parents house to a home that I own. I know that some people don't think that should be a priority or think it is impossible for a young person, but in Charleston it is far more expensive to rent than to own. I would be paying well over $2000 monthly towards something I don't own. I plan on purchasing a very small condo at first. It is hard to find anything in a decent area under $250-$300k. I have a goal of saving $70k by the time that I buy. I am just wondering how I should start planning for this, and what I can do now to make it possible?

The car is a 2015 Audi A4 in good working order. It has 45k miles and no major issues at the moment. It has had one major repair to the tune of about $2200 to replace worn control arm bushings and the tires they mangled (I have still yet to determine a clear reason as to why these wore out so quickly). The car now has fresh tires and might need brake pads replaced soon/eventually. KBB says the car worth about $15k-$17k private party and $12k-$14k trade in.

I’ve been thinking about replacing it with something like a slightly used Honda/Toyota/Etc. (what seems to be the standard r/pf recommendation at this point). I’m mainly interested in something reliable and with lower maintenance and insurance costs. A vehicle with either better gas mileage or more hauling space would be a bonus. I think the proceeds from the sale of the car would cover the cost of an econobox with better gas mileage, whereas I don’t think the same is true if I spring for an SUV or hatchback with more trunk space.

Does it make any sense at all to sell or trade-in a paid-off and perfectly functional car for something else? Would my transaction costs eat up any maintenance or insurance savings?

It has had one major repair to the tune of about $2200 to replace worn control arm bushings and the tires they mangled (I have still yet to determine a clear reason as to why these wore out so quickly). The car now has fresh tires and might need brake pads replaced soon/eventually. KBB says the car worth about $15k-$17k private party and $12k-$14k trade in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking about replacing it with something like a slightly used Honda/Toyota/Etc. (what seems to be the standard &lt;a href=""/r/pf""&gt;r/pf&lt;/a&gt; recommendation at this point). I’m mainly interested in something reliable and with lower maintenance and insurance costs. A vehicle with either better gas mileage or more hauling space would be a bonus. I think the proceeds from the sale of the car would cover the cost of an econobox with better gas mileage, whereas I don’t think the same is true if I spring for an SUV or hatchback with more trunk space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it make any sense at all to sell or trade-in a paid-off and perfectly functional car for something else? Would my transaction costs eat up any maintenance or insurance savings? I just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

This is all very hypothetical but I wanted to understand all of my options in case something like this does happen.  I have money tied up in several cryptocurrencies. As you know, they're highly volatile and in many cases can reach significant gains before quickly falling back down. If one (or more)  of these were to hit it big such that I were to have huge gains, I'd be inclined to cash out.  However, that presents a question about taxation.  Let's assume, crazy as it may sound, that I were to gain $500k one day from crypto prices rising, what's the best way to (legally) limit the amount of money I would owe in taxes on that investment?

&amp;#x200B;

From the website I'm looking at I would owe $153,798.50 plus 37% of the amount over $510,300.  I also have a 100k+ job.  From my understanding, I would owe the IRS over $190k assuming this were to happen in 2019.   Am I seeing this right?  Are there any other options? Could this be reduced through an LLC?

my question is about disputing it. I was never contacted by the lawyer, who had previously gone through the executor (my relative) to get my address to send me mail. I was never contacted by the third party collections agency. I have had the same phone number for the past 5+years. 

what does the process of debt disputing look like? is it likely to get this removed from my credit? is it wise to contact the lawyer and ask why I am being charged with this debt? shoukd I post this over to legal advice instead? (btw I am located in MB, the lawyers and my relatives are all in ON.)

I have a tendency to ramble so I'm just going to lay this all out as easily as I can. I'm 25-years-old and I just bought a house with my fiancée. We are getting married next year and after spending way much more money on the move than I was expecting and seeing the costs of our wedding + the amount of debt I'll be taking on (my fiancée has roughly 6x as much in student loans than I do) I am pretty overwhelmed at how much more difficult managing money has become.

So here are my debts (excluding my mortgage):

Description - balance remaining - monthly payment - APR

Auto loan - $4000 - $175 - 6%

Student loans - $7000 - $120 - 3.5%

Credit Card (not proud of this) - $5000 - $150 - 16%

Credit Card Refinanced Loan - $2500 - $250 - 10%

And here is how I budget it out (roughly): my paychecks are $1500 after taxes. I contribute 6% to my 401k and my employer matches half of that. Each paycheck I also put $50 in a savings account that my fiancée and I use for costs around the house (we just drained that account to pay for our down payment). After taking out our monthly necessary expenses (minimum debt payments, insurance, utilities, groceries, etc.) I have about $500 left that I usually spend about half on leisurely things and the other half I put towards my credit card.

So what should I do here? I think the $50 I put towards my savings is necessary in case we run into something unexpected (i.e. medical expenses, something in the house breaks). I also think I should refinance my credit card debt and close that card (I got it in college and it's gotten out of control a few times). I'm wondering if I should stop my 401k contributions and put all of those savings towards my credit card, but at the same time I don't have shit saved up for retirement and my company match is free money, so I don't know.

I am 22 and currently live at home with my parents and commute into DC. Given that I am not paying any rent, my monthly expenses are pretty low. I am probably going to stay on my parents' health insurance for as long as it makes sense to.

I bank with Capital One and have 18k in a checking account. I have no debt or payments or anything like that and I've never had a credit card.

Basically, I am asking what to do from here? I start full time on Monday and anticipate maxing my 401k contributions. Where else should I start investing and saving? I will talk to our HR person about specifics about the transportation savings program and other things. I am also considering taking some classes on R and SQL so I can contribute more at work and be more marketable later on in my career.

I am content living at home for the time being, but I would probably like to move out in the next 2 years. At what point does it make sense to move out?

Long term, I would like to go to grad school at some point. I studied Environmental Science so I would look for research graduate programs that would pay for the grad school. Other than that, I would probably like to do PeaceCorps and buy a house at some point. Not immediate concerns but stuff to consider down the line.

I've know for awhile now that I'd be much better off cooking at home but hadn't ever really bothered to figure out how much it was costing me. I now realize that I spend more on food a month than I do on rent and I've now racked up $2200 in credit card debt that's just added up a little bit at a time.

I've always known eating out was killing me physically. Now that I know that it's killing me fiscally its been eating at my mind killing me mentally.

I'm at a loss on what to do to kill this habit and stop spending money. I need to get rid of that debt before something bad happens.

Update/Edit:

I've gotten a ton of really good recommendations from you all and I genuinely appreciate the support, kind words, and advise given. 

I've installed Mint and have set a budget for $100 for eating out for the month.
I will be going to the grocery store tonight to pick up:
* x1 Gallon of Milk
* x1 Box of Raisin Bran Crunch
* x1 Carton of Eggs
* x1 Package of Cheese sticks
* x1 5 piece package of chicken breasts
* x5 packages of various veggies
* x2 packages of salad mix
* x1 form of beef like thing

The mortgage payment and the 550$ a month I've been paying for the credit cards was hard enough, but to now add on the medical bills? I don't know how I can stay afloat--and stressing over it won't help my health!

I feel like these are my options: 1.) Sell the house. Except I don't have any money to do any little fix ups and people seem to want HGTV IRL. Plus what if it takes months and months?

2.) Re-finance the house and cash out some of the equity. Except I don't have great credit. I would need to get enough cash that I could at least pay off the CC to make it worth it without really rasing the monthly payment by much. Is that possible?

I had a surgery back in December. This was a voluntary surgery. I had my fallopian tubes removed. I was told from the very beginning and at multiple times throughout the process that it was 100% covered by my insurance. Apparently not.

At first I received a bill for the anesthesiologist for about $100. Several weeks later I was receiving phone calls saying that I owed another $300 for something else. They never told me what.

She said she would have to make a phone call to find out and since it was the end of the day she might not know anything until the next day. That's fine. She called me back the next morning and basically said that she's going to have to submit an inquiry and that it could take up to 14 days to hear back and that she would call when she knew something. She never called or if she did she couldn't be bothered to leave a message for me to call back.

Several weeks have passed since then and I've just received a bill in the mail that is in the amount of $975 for this surgery that was supposed to be 100% covered. I'm going to call or stop by the hospital Monday to talk to them but I was hoping to have some input from an outside source on how best to approach this.

I currently own a house in the New York area and have about 40k in equity. I would owe 13k on my auto loan *after* trade in (I've already gotten an appraisal on the value). I have about 5k in credit card debt (with a strict budget plan set to get these paid down). I make around 53k a year with great benefits, retirement, paid leave and all, I love my job.

I want to have a slower lifestyle on the country side somewhere, start a smallholder/homestead and possibly start my own business woodworking.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a question about investing in index funds and will appreciate your opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been working for a few years and saved up some money. I didn't have the habit of investing. I know I should have invested earlier but better late than never :) 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to invest about 20-30K in three or four index funds via vanguard. My plan is to just put the money in and forget about it for the next 30 years.  I do NOT plan on continually investing my income regularly to these funds for the next few years.  (background: I plan to leave my fulltime job and start my own business in about a year. I don't expect to have much income in the following two years or so after I quit. I plan on living off my savings until my business takes off.)

&amp;#x200B;

Question: is it stupid to just dump all the money I budgeted for index funds all at once or I better do that gradually? I suspect there might be some tax benefits of putting the money in gradually that I'm not aware of.

&amp;#x200B;

If investing $20K into index funds in one go has no downside related to tax, are there other things I should watch out for such as timing?

&amp;#x200B;

All feedback is appreciated. Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi friends,&lt;/p&gt;

I am unclear on a few things and Google + Reddit searches haven't cleared it up so I feel like I might be fundamentally misunderstanding how vesting works.

I previously thought that separate vesting applies to *each year* of contributions. So for example, if the company matches 1-to-1 up to 4%, but vests 50% each year:

Year 1: Contribute 4%, company matches 4%

Year 2: Contribute 4%, company matches 4%. However, if you leave immediately after the match, you take your self-contributed 8% + 2% (50% vested from year 1) + 0% (nothing vested from year 2)

Year 3: Contribute 4%, company matches 4%. If you leave, you take 12% + 4% (yr 1) + 2% (yr 2) + 0% (yr 3)

This honestly seems pretty complicated and I don't think I have the right idea. Searches say that vesting is just the % you take with you from the employer's match, period. So after 2 years, you're 100% vested and you'll take the **entire** employer match from the second year and any future years, even if you leave immediately after receiving the match.

The part I get even more confused about is that I've heard of compensation packages where you get X amount of stocks, but you only receive them **3 years** after the pay year (not just when you're allowed to sell). So if you stay at a company for **4 years**, you receive only **1 year's** worth of stocks.

So my question is: how exactly does vesting work? If you stay for 2 years, do you get the entire employer match, or do you only get the entire employer match for the first year?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I recently got a new job where the company uses graded vesting for their 401k match (previously, my company match was 100% vested immediately).

Is it safer to send that money to my dad account first, and then him sending it? (It may trigger some “donations” tax in our home country though).&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

So I’m starting a new job on July 22nd and I was wondering how much I’m likely to earn per month on £22k. In this tax year, I've only been paid £1577 by my previous employer before leaving in early June. Therefore, I've only used £1577 of my tax-free Personal Allowance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Will I be taxed at the full 20% each month on my new salary? Or will I be exempt from tax for a few months until my payments have caught up with the Personal Allowance?

&amp;#x200B;

My first monthly pay will be on August 27th for all of August and the end of July (due to only starting one week before the first pay day of July 27th). 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this makes sense and thanks to anyone who helps me figure this out!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi people,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I got in an accident and totalled the truck now, it would be nice to have the insurance payout there to put towards another used vehicle.  But if I dropped the collision coverage, and then wrecked the truck, I could pay cash for another reasonable used vehicle and it wouldn&amp;#39;t ruin me financially.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At what point is it better to save the money on the insurance bill, and risk a larger loss in the even that I wreck the truck? Does it just come down to my risk aversion, or is there a way to mathematically decide?&lt;/p&gt;

Earn generally 700/week after tax(hours can differ but this is the average)

Currently no debt whatsoever(scholarships, part time jobs, community college)

Currently staying with family (but I am itching to get out) rent free.

Current Savings: 7k

Current Investments: $700 in stocks (grew from 500 by sheer luck woo!)

Questions:

&amp;#x200B;

I've been advised to buy rather than rent. I found a condo I like for 54k in a decent neighborhood. This would mean saving for half a year and immediately sinking all that money into the downpayment. Not really a question, but how do people do something this scary?

&amp;#x200B;

What am I supposed to do with my savings? I'm a new hire and won't have access to the 401k benefit until next year. Is there any way to grow my money in the short term? I have access to Navy Federal Credit Union, which I hear is better than an average bank, but I don't really understand how.

I have read the various threads on reducing debt, etc. but wanted some feedback on my particular situation. Mid-50s and married with one child finishing up college (one year to go) and one in tech college for carpentry (finishes at end of the year). Over the course of the years, due to layoff and taking a lower salary position, we accumulated a lot of debt.  I have a couple of credit cards with about $45k in debt and a couple of car loans (about $45k there).  I recently vested into some company options and stock.  I had to cash options due to a time limit and that's about $40k in cash just sitting there. The rest is company stock at about $80k, but need to hold it for two years to avoid capital gains tax.  

I'm thinking of using the vesting proceeds to reduce the debt (stock just hit an all time high if that matters).  I can pay off one / possibly two of the credit cards (around $40k) with the cash on hand from the options.  but I need to keep the stock for two years to avoid capital gains tax.  My thinking is to use the cash from the options to reduce the debt since I probably can't beat the interest I'm paying on the debt in the near term.

Any additional thoughts here?  What would you do?  Appreciate any insights or thoughts and thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there - first time poster, and have found lots of valuable info here.  I have read the various threads on reducing debt, etc. but wanted some feedback on my particular situation. Mid-50s and married with one child finishing up college (one year to go) and one in tech college for carpentry (finishes at end of the year). Over the course of the years, due to layoff and taking a lower salary position, we accumulated a lot of debt.  I have a couple of credit cards with about $45k in debt and a couple of car loans (about $45k there).  I recently vested into some company options and stock.  I had to cash options due to a time limit and that&amp;#39;s about $40k in cash just sitting there. The rest is company stock at about $80k, but need to hold it for two years to avoid capital gains tax.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking of using the vesting proceeds to reduce the debt (stock just hit an all time high if that matters).  I can pay off one / possibly two of the credit cards (around $40k) with the cash on hand from the options.  but I need to keep the stock for two years to avoid capital gains tax.  My thinking is to use the cash from the options to reduce the debt since I probably can&amp;#39;t beat the interest I&amp;#39;m paying on the debt in the near term.  And then sit on the stock for a while to avoid the capital gains.  We do have some money in IRA/401K for retirement, but a bit behind where we should be for our age.   We will also likely have a horrible tax bill due this next year, so want to ensure I don&amp;#39;t get caught short there.&lt;/p&gt;

**Background:**

4 years ago I was diagnosed with leukemia out of the blue. I am self-employed and needed to immediately stop working on building a company to undergo extensive treatment. There has been no income on my end (other than SSDI) for 3 of the 4 years having just returned to work just over part-time (I can't quite work full-time as I am in and out of the hospital and have numerous medical appointments each month). Because I consult in a lucrative industry, my hourly rate is pretty decent, though. My wife has a very stable career, working for a great company with benefits, retirement, and a six-figure salary. We were able to sustain the extensive medical bills over the last 4 years + maintain a decent lifestyle. Our savings was pretty much drained for both living expenses and medical costs, however, and between the two of us we (somewhat foolishly, admittedly) accrued a significant amount of consumer debt. We've never struggled to pay it, and we aren't in over our heads, per se.

We have several credit cards with varying amounts, and my wife's cards have pretty low interest. Because of my income changes and use of my credit to keep my business afloat, most of my creditors have jacked up interest rates. Again, I can pay, and I can come up with a plan to pay off the cards, but it would be MUCH better to a) have the debt in one place and b) have a much lower interest rate. Total debt we would need/want to consolidate is about $50,000. I'm not worried about the monthly payment on a loan like that as we can probably pay it off in 18 months or less.

I'd like to get some feedback for the sub on some options I'm considering:
&amp;#x200B;

1) Cash-out refi on our home. We have about $100,000 in equity we could pull from, but the idea that we now have debt tied to our primary home is a bit scary. Should something happen to me due to my medical condition, I don't want my wife stuck with this high mortgage that she can't get out from. I don't \*think\* that would happen, but it still weighs on me a a concern. Additionally, we are in Texas, and the few places I've talked to won't fund a cash-out mortgage here. I haven't successfully found a lender who would consider it, so we might just skip this option altogether.

2) Shuffle debt around on credit cards, maybe with a 0% offer or two. We \***do not**\* want to open any more credit card accounts; we have enough and will likely close at least half of what we currently have open. This also gets messy with fees for the transfers and does nothing to just have the debt in one place.

3) Take out a personal loan with one of the companies which offers such a deal. We've gone through the pre-approval process with SoFi, and they have a decent rate on a 36 month note. Again, we won't be taking that long to pay it off.

\#3 feels like our best option to consolidate and save some interest. My only worry is that some of these consolidation companies, I've heard, have penalties for pre-payment of the loan. I'm not sure how true that is. The companies we are considering right now:

* SoFi
* Credit9 (I can't find anything but mixed reviews; not sure if this is a scam or not)
* LightStream
* USAA, since we are members. I don't know if they'll loan the amount we want.

One option we've thought of is getting the consolidation loan then, once all of our credit cards have zero balances, see if any 0% offers come in from existing accounts. If so, we could transfer to one or two cards and save even more interest, assuming the transfer fees don't negate the 0% offer. We may not even consider this as it just perpetuates the cycle of using credit cards for anything, and we want to move away from that mindset.

Feedback, please, from this insanely great sub! We'e been lurking for about a year, and we've really been able to get the ball rolling on life returning to normal from a financial standpoint. We're up-to-date in YNAB and are moving to a cash basis for our monthly budget.

Made a throwaway account as I am embarrassed to be in this position, but through therapy have found strength to ask for advice.

I am 27 and in desperate need of guidance after a decade of bad habits. I quit my job 2 months ago without another lined up as it was becoming toxic, abusive, and critically endangering my mental health stability. I applied for unemployment and am still in that process (have my interview next week). I also signed up with my city's job center and am actively applying. I was passively job hunting since the beginning of the year, and now it is all engines running.

I am committed to doing better and need help formulating an attack plan for the next, well lifetime, until I battle my way out of debt

*Here are my monthly expenditures*:

* Rent, $1200, Los Angeles
* Renter's insurance, $7 (required for my building)
* Gym, $15
* Food, $150
* Transit, $100 (unlimited metro pass)
* Internet, $50.99
* Cellphone, $30
* Electricity, $300 (billed every 2months)
* Therapy, $280 ($70 a week, no health insurance right now)

and then my loans/credit cards

* Private loan: $16,000 ; 6% interest
* Chase credit card: $4,000 ; 25.99%
* Capital One: $12,400 ; 22.05%
* American Express: $10,840 ; 21%
* Student Fed Loans: $36,800 ; deferment 

I know without stable income as a guide, it might be hard to get advice. But I want a plan of attack to work on now as I eventually start bringing in more money.

More details: Currently live in a studio. I do not have family to ask for help, they kicked me out when I was 17. I don't have close friends and of the ones I know by name, we are all pretty much struggling. My last job I was making $33k. Credit score is 580, I racked up a lot of credit card debt being young, dumb and vulnerable to people who took me in, not going to beat myself up over it further. I am relatively in a much better place now mentally and want to work on getting the rest of my life stable. 

I paid July's rent and the rest of my bills earlier this week and that officially brought my checking and savings account balance to $0. I am applying to everything like I said earlier and earlier today submitted my information to start delivering food for PostMates and Uber on my bike.

Please give me all the advice you have and tips. It is not an excuse, but I never had proper guidance on how to make responsible healthy choices. I put in the work in therapy, and am ready to put in the work now to handle and attack this. I will research and learn on my own as well starting with this sub's wiki. 

If anyone has been in a similar life situation, I would love to hear advice and experience.

If you need more information I am happy to answer questions, new to this so appreciate it all, thanks.

We recently had a baby and are starting to look at homes with more space. Depending on the house we ultimately choose, we could likely afford to keep the condo and rent it out.

Based on sales of comparable units in our building, the condo has appreciated modestly since we bought it. Units don't stay on the market long.

Right now we are focused on paying down debt, which I think will take anywhere from 2-5 years. That is student loan debt, credit card debt and 2 cars (both of which are less than 3 years old and will last us until we leave). 


The main thing we are not sure on is whether we should buy a house here or not. Before we decided we were leaving, we were planning to start looking at houses in 2ish years, we currently don’t make enough money where I’d be comfortable owning a house, even if the mortgage payment was slightly less than our rent,  because it would be impossible for us to handle any major repairs or maintenance without going into more (probably high interest)  debt. 


The biggest issue I see to buying a house is that there is a lack of homes in the price range I think is reasonable that would make a good shorter term investment. The price range we’re looking at is almost always older homes that need to be updated to be livable, or homes that have been flipped and are totally renovated, but in unsafe areas. If we were staying I’d be willing to spend a little more to buy something that needed updates in a better area, but I’m not sure that would be wise if we are planning to leave. I’ve also seen some attached/townhouse/condo style places that are very affordable and that I like, but they are older and I don’t think they would appreciate in value, and would most likely be difficult to sell. There is a lot of new construction, so these older homes and townhomes are not in demand at all, most are getting torn down by developers and being replaced with housing 5-6 times more expensive then what was there. 


 So the main question is, should we continue to rent and focus on saving money, should we buy an inexpensive house (keeping in mind the above info about the realities of that option) and save money, or should we buy a more expensive house with the plan to dump all of our money into the mortgage? I know it seems like we should obviously buy a less expensive house to save and build equity, but like I said I am nervous about that because we would still be spending a significant amount on our house and  would need to get it back out when it was time to leave. In either of the house buying scenarios, we are not saving significantly on rent, we pay $1300 and with insurance and everything the house would be around $1000/month minimum. Should we just keep renting and saving, is it worth buying house at all given our situation? 

TLDR: planning to move abroad in the next 8-10 years, is it better to buy a less expensive less desirable house and save some money, is it better to keep renting and save some money, or is it better to buy a more expensive house and dump all of our money into it hoping to build equity?

EDIT: I think I inadvertently answered my own question while paying my car loan (it’s below $6k now, yay!). On any new loan you will pay primarily interest for awhile, so we wouldn’t actually build any equity in that timeframe. Just came to me because I am paying almost all principle on my car now that I’m close to paying it off.

Because a mortgage broker that I recently contracted told me that I have to show 2 years of employment to be able to USE the money that I have received from working as a 1099 independent contractor TOWARDS the down payment.  That sounds ridiculous! I do not have 2 years of prior employment of any kind since I have been self employed (without receiving a 1099 until a few months ago) and I can not provide my Federal Income taxes because it is REALLY COMPLICATED (working with IRS, please don't ask). So for this question, let's please go with the fact that I am not providing my federal income taxes por the mortgage, but my fiancé is. She has been employed for more than 10 years with different employers and right now earns 60k a year. She also has done her taxes on time, so her name is on the loan as the primary, I will be the co-borrower. We will use her work history and her steady income to pay the loan monthly (until I recover), but I will be the one putting all the money towards the downpayment and closing costs.

What is stressing me out is that I have to put a 25% down to be able to get the lowest interest rate possible for the loan that he is offering us. This is no problem since I got 91k in between checkings and cash. We both have 0 debt. As stated in the beginning, the mortgage broker said that I can't use the money I earned as a 1099 independent worker because I have no work history of at least 2 years. That means that I can't use 20k of my money! Which would leave me with exactly 58.7k of checking account money which I haven't touched and no movement made to those accounts within 1 year. The other 12.3k I have it in cash. The downpayment for the house is 55.7k.  CRITICAL QUESTION. Can I use my cash money to pay for closing costs?

I'm a 24 YO engineering grad student

I have no college debt from undergrad

I can save up to $1k/mo after rent, food, utilities

I have about $5k sitting in a past employer's 401 account

I have $55k in savings and checkings accounts (started in high school)

I opened and maxed out a Roth IRA in Nov 2018 ($5.5k deposit, now $3.3k in VFIAX, $2.7k in VTTSX) 

I'm at least 1 year from graduating with my masters, and **I may start a company with my adviser and lab group next year.** Note, the company's startup costs will be in the hundreds of thousands, so I don't know if it's worth it to save some money to invest in our company.

**Questions**

I've heard about the interest gains of a Roth IRA, but ho-lee-shit was I lazy. I can't believe my holdings grew by $600 in almost half a year. I want to move more of my savings money to investment funds.

Since my previous Roth contribution was Nov 2018, I want to transfer another $5.5k and max out this year's contribution. **Is this wise?**

I've read that you can only contribute a max of $5.5k/year across *all* IRAs. **Is this true?** If so, is there a practical and legal way of getting around this?

Ideally, I'd like to rollover the 401 money into an IRA and contribute $40k from my savings/checking accounts to this fund. I'll leave $5k for checking and $10k for emergency savings. **Do you have any other suggestions?**

Instead of feeling guilty for not moving my money faster, I'm using the $600 ""wow!"" factor to motivate me to finally budget, budget, budget. I've just been flying by the seat of my pants so far...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Long story short; I've been running a YouTube channel for the last 5 or so years. I live in Ontario, Canada, and the the total revenue I've made from those years is about 20,000 CAD.

Keeping interest in mind, how much would I be looking at total owed to the CRA? I can easily pay the amount no problem, as long as it's between 3-7 grand (again, not sure about accumulating interest), but I have no idea how exactly I would go about paying it.

I&amp;#39;ve looked at the Canadian Revenue Agency&amp;#39;s framework and from what I&amp;#39;ve gathered, the tax rate on income &amp;lt;45,000 CAD is 15%. So that&amp;#39;s about 3 grand. Keeping interest in mind, how much would I be looking at total owed to the CRA? I can easily pay the amount no problem, as long as it&amp;#39;s between 3-7 grand (again, not sure about accumulating interest), but I have no idea how exactly I would go about paying it. Would I just file the total income of the last 5 years on my 2019 tax return? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m hoping for some advice on the best way to pay off my student loans as fast as possible. I recently went self employed and am making much more money than I used to. 6 years after graduating, I’m finally in a position to destroy my student loans. Here’s the scoop:

$98,000 total. 

Loan 1: federal loans, $48,000 @ 6.2% interest
Loan 2: private loans $27,000 @ 11.2% interest
Loan 3: collections $23,000 @ 0% interest. 

The loan in collections was at 13.5%, and after paying $14,000 on it, the balance went up $800 so I stopped paying. Seemed for nothing. Kind of having the same issue with loan 2. Now I know you’re supposed to pay the highest interest rate first, but having a loan in collections is killing my credit, and keeping me from being able to get a mortgage, car loan, all kinds of stuff. 

I recently put in an offer to settle the loan for $16,000, paying $666 over 2 years. Do you think it’s best to eliminate that loan as aggressively and as fast as possible, then snowball that into the high interest loan? Or tackle the high interest one first? I’ll basically be trying to pay $1,500/mo total to all 3, but it’s gonna be a little stretch with taxes and all my other bills. Determined to get out from under this though. 

Also, is settling in full worse in the long term than paying in full? I’d save a ton of money if I settled and paid it off in 2 years, but I want to think long term as well.

I graduated with my MA in 2014 and finally have a decent paying job in my field (50k annual pay). I did find a surprise 3k in a pension from another job, but other than that, I have nothing for retirement. Single, no kids, may consider a kid in the future.

My current employer deposits a flat $350/month into my 401k. I'm wondering how much I should contribute considering I'm starting late in life. 15%? 20% sounds like a lot especially considering the employer contribution, and I'd like to keep saving for a down payment on a house one day.

I'd like to say I have a proper budget but every month I usually come out ahead, so I haven't budgeted strictly and have 10k saved on my own. 

No credit card debt other than an interest-free $800 couch at the moment (I just did that to stretch out moving expenses, unfortunately it dropped my stellar credit score by 15 points 😑).

Some info about my finances if anyone cares, suggestions welcome:

I pay $1000/mo for house, $350/mo for car (overpaying by $100/mo, 5k left on loan for 2012 Forester 3% interest), and $130/mo on student loans (this will probably be higher when it adjusts later--on PSLF program 70k total debt). Utilities including internet probably $250ish (old house), phone $50. Groceries are where I fuck up budgeting--if I'm strict it should be no more than $200/mo but I frequently spend more and eat out too much and waste a lot. $80 on car insurance, may go down in my current location. I work close to home but explore a lot on weekends, so not sure on gas yet. Healthcare covered by employer (they deposit $25/mo on some sort of health card that I can have through retirement) but dental is $5/mo. Other expenses, clothes etc. are very sporadic.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all.

The dishwasher was $500, and I was told that we would be paying $40 upfront, and $22.57 per week for the $500 with 0% interest (I was told that they do the $40 one time fee instead of interest), just until that was paid off (roughly $540 after taxes). 
I was told by the appliance it would be paid off at the end of June, but they still have been taking payments out, so I checked the contract today, and found out that I apparently have to make 52 payments of $22.57! That ends up being over double the price of the appliance and fees, and twice as long as what I was told!
The dishwasher hasn't even worked since I bought it, and I can't afford to have someone come fix it, and I didn't get the warranty because it was almost half the price of the machine itself and wasn't in the budget.

To top it all off the lender also mentioned that if I made an extra mortgage payment each year (all of it going towards the principal) I could pay off the loan much faster.

All of that sounds appealing, especially because I'm pretty early in my career so lots of room to climb and my work allows some opportunities to travel and really cash in on overtime/per diem. So it's feasible that I'll be able to do that, possibly even more.

So the question is with a loan at 3.85% interest should I even care about paying down my mortgage early? Is it best to hope that I can get 4% by investing spare cash when it comes up? Or should I look to build equity in my home by doing something like remodeling the bathroom?

For additional context: I pay 5% towards my retirement that's matched by my employer and then I put an additional 200/mo into an IRA. Not maxing out my retirement but contributing.

I own a small 2-door car (2015) that I've bought nearly 3 years ago, that is worth around $12,000 according to KBB and other sources. The car has some cosmetic damages, but mechanically it is great, and it has been maintained properly at the official dealerships. 

The thing is, I am moving across the country where I won't really need this car. And I will be at this new city for over 3 years. So I decided to put it up for sale on various online markets like Facebook, Craigslist, and TRED (which posts ads on USAA used car sale pages and others), but I have not been too successful with this. 

I am moving in less than two weeks, which makes me a bit anxious, as I would really like to sell the car before I move. At the moment, I foresee two different options:

1. Sell the car to a dealership at a mere fraction (~$7,500 is what I was quoted) of the desired price

2. Keep the car at my folks' place, keeping it up for sale while changing the policy for the insurance, hoping that it would sell at some point

The latter of the two options is just a little difficult, being that I would have to rely on my folks to conduct face-to-face, off-market test drives and title transfers and whatnot in my place. This situation would be a little more comforting if it wasn't for the fact that their English skills are fairly limited.

Age 25, currently debt free

I am doing the full match plus some in my 401(k) at work

Have the emergency fund built up and in a high interest savings account

I have maxed my Roth IRA contributions for 2019 already (at wealthfront, not paying a fee yet, may move it if I can someday, clueless on how that works)

Is there somewhere I can start an investment account for free and just pay the expense fees on ETFs, and not on anything else?  I don't really know when to buy or sell, my thought was just sit on these for 40+ years.

As I understand, a general rule is 110 - 25 = 85% in stocks. Would I do something like:

&amp;#x200B;

VTI 35%

VOO 30%

VEA 10%

VWO 10%

VTEB 10%

And 5% in something fun in MJ/YOLO or ARKG or something?

Buckle Up. 

I’m male, between 40-45. I live in a large southwestern city. I have some marketable skills, but no degree in anything. 

Due to circumstances beyond my control, I lost a high-paying and well-benefitted career approximately 5 years ago. I used to make just under $100,000 per year. I had been with that company for nearly 13 years when all hell broke loose and I had to leave. 

Because I was vested in the company, I technically “retired”, and, due to the shit-storm that was happening at the time I took the age-penalty and started drawing my retirement early. Had I waited until I was 55, I could’ve taken slightly more than $3,000 each month, but because I was pushing 40 at the time, my monthly benefit amount was penalized by about 66% so, currently, I get just a teensy bit more than $1,000 each month after the taxes are deducted. That benefit will continue for life. 

I currently use this money to make my mortgage payment and my power bill. 

I own a home, I’ve lived in this house for about 18 years. Due to the aforementioned shit-storm, I was able to qualify for HAMP and, through the use of a specialized attorney, I was able to stay in my home and modify the loan. I currently pay $800 per month for my house including my escrow account (taxes and insurance). My loan is at 2%. I could not even find a simple 1-bedroom apartment in my city for less than that, unless I were to move into a scummy daily/weekly, and I’ve accumulated a commensurate amount of stuff to fill my house with over the past nearly two decades, so moving/downsizing is not an option. It's a three-bedroom home, but aside from the one master bedroom, the other space is an office and the third space is basically storage / a bigass walk-in closet, so having a roommate is not an option. 

The same attorney who helped me keep my house also filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy for me which was successfully discharged in late 2016. 

I was doing okay, right up until January of 2019. I had a decent job making $850 per week flat rate (so, my paycheck every two weeks was between $1400-$1500) plus cash tips which were actually pretty good some nights. Some nights I walked out with $70, other nights I left with over $200. I met someone - romantically speaking - and when we met, this person had a dream of going to a specific (and notoriously expensive) city for their next birthday. 

I saved my tips for a few months and was able to take my S/O to the place they dreamed of. That trip cost me about $6,000 with airfare, hotel and spending money. When I came home, I had emptied my stash of cash and went back to work to hit it hard and make more… but three days later I was surprised with a meeting wherein I was told that my position had been eliminated, sign here for your final check, hand over your keys, and GTFO. (Funny story, on my way home from getting fired, a truck kicked up a rock on the freeway and busted my windshield... so there went $300 right away after spending all my money on vacation and getting fired.... fun)

So here I am. Early 40’s. Been on unemployment benefits of $400 per week since the end of January. My dad loaned me $10,000 from his 401K retirement account to keep me afloat. I have been living off that and my own $1,000 per month and my unemployment. I have about $1,500 left in the bank. 

Thanks to an unexpected change in tax law last year and not realizing that my tax bracket was higher than the year before, I owe the IRS about $1800, actually $1090 of that is the penalty for not having Obamacare…. But anyway.

Due to an uninsured trip to the hospital ER a few years ago, I have about $4,000 sitting in collections right now. 

I have a 2.5 year old car, but previously (before this relationship) I had been dating someone in another state so my 2.5 year old car has over 71,000 miles on it and I don’t even have the money to fix it if something goes wrong. Obviously no warranty. My partner doesn’t drive or own a car, so I’ve been driving them back and forth to work since I have all this free-time on my hands. Long-story short, I need a car. My most recent job was a 25 mile trip one way. My partner’s work is 14 miles away. It’s hot here and public transit sucks, so ditching the car isn’t option. The car payment is $470 per month and I owe about $17,000 on it yet. As far as a trade-in, with the high mileage and wear-and-tear it's probably worth about $13,000. Maybe 14K if I'm lucky.

My partner doesn’t make much money and has like 5 credit cards… and they recently bought the new iPad Pro and they’re paying for it in installments on their phone bill… so their monthly phone bill is like $400!! They pitch in for groceries or gas here and there, but their paycheck is really only like $800-$900 every two weeks, so I can’t really count on my partner for any financial assistance at this point. 

Oh, and I have one credit card that’s maxed out at $5,500. I’m making the minimum payments of about $180 per month.

So I start a new job in a few weeks, thank GOD… but I’m expecting $800-$1000 bi-weekly pay. Significantly lower than the $1500 bi-weekly paychecks I was getting prior to January (and not to mention this job won’t be sending me home with $70-$200 cash tips two or three nights per week). 

The good news is that I have —easily— $100,000 equity in my home. Probably closer to $125,000, but considering a discharged Chapter 7 three years ago, no income right now, and $4k in collections, I don’t see me getting a home equity loan any time soon. 

I was thinking maybe when I can prove income, take out a loan against the house and pay off the IRS, Collections, and the car loan and have one loan payment to make each month… then I have money available to repair the car if anything needs fixing. Or then sell the car, put that lump sum as a big payment back to the home equity loan and get something less expensive? 

See guys, I’m too close to my own problems here and I’m spinning my wheels. I can’t see the forest because of the trees. Do you guys have any advice on how to proceed once I start getting income flowing again? Maybe you will come up with something I haven’t considered. 

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok PF, I’m seeking your best advice with what has become my own personal financial disaster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buckle Up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m male, between 40-45. I live in a large southwestern city. I have some marketable skills, but no degree in anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to circumstances beyond my control, I lost a high-paying and well-benefitted career approximately 5 years ago. I used to make just under $100,000 per year. I had been with that company for nearly 13 years when all hell broke loose and I had to leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I was vested in the company, I technically “retired”, and, due to the shit-storm that was happening at the time I took the age-penalty and started drawing my retirement early. Had I waited until I was 55, I could’ve taken slightly more than $3,000 each month, but because I was pushing 40 at the time, my monthly benefit amount was penalized by about 66% so, currently, I get just a teensy bit more than $1,000 each month after the taxes are deducted. That benefit will continue for life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently use this money to make my mortgage payment and my power bill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own a home, I’ve lived in this house for about 18 years. Due to the aforementioned shit-storm, I was able to qualify for HAMP and, through the use of a specialized attorney, I was able to stay in my home and modify the loan. I currently pay $800 per month for my house including my escrow account (taxes and insurance). My loan is at 2%. I could not even find a simple 1-bedroom apartment in my city for less than that, unless I were to move into a scummy daily/weekly, and I’ve accumulated a commensurate amount of stuff to fill my house with over the past nearly two decades, so moving/downsizing is not an option. It&amp;#39;s a three-bedroom home, but aside from the one master bedroom, the other space is an office and the third space is basically storage / a bigass walk-in closet, so having a roommate is not an option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same attorney who helped me keep my house also filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy for me which was successfully discharged in late 2016. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was doing okay, right up until January of 2019. I had a decent job making $850 per week flat rate (so, my paycheck every two weeks was between $1400-$1500) plus cash tips which were actually pretty good some nights. Some nights I walked out with $70, other nights I left with over $200. I met someone - romantically speaking - and when we met, this person had a dream of going to a specific (and notoriously expensive) city for their next birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saved my tips for a few months and was able to take my S/O to the place they dreamed of. That trip cost me about $6,000 with airfare, hotel and spending money. When I came home, I had emptied my stash of cash and went back to work to hit it hard and make more… but three days later I was surprised with a meeting wherein I was told that my position had been eliminated, sign here for your final check, hand over your keys, and GTFO. (Funny story, on my way home from getting fired, a truck kicked up a rock on the freeway and busted my windshield... so there went $300 right away after spending all my money on vacation and getting fired.... fun)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am. Early 40’s. Been on unemployment benefits of $400 per week since the end of January. My dad loaned me $10,000 from his 401K retirement account to keep me afloat. I have been living off that and my own $1,000 per month and my unemployment. I have about $1,500 left in the bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to an unexpected change in tax law last year and not realizing that my tax bracket was higher than the year before, I owe the IRS about $1800, actually $1090 of that is the penalty for not having Obamacare…. But anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to an uninsured trip to the hospital ER a few years ago, I have about $4,000 sitting in collections right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a 2.5 year old car, but previously (before this relationship) I had been dating someone in another state so my 2.5 year old car has over 71,000 miles on it and I don’t even have the money to fix it if something goes wrong. Obviously no warranty. My partner doesn’t drive or own a car, so I’ve been driving them back and forth to work since I have all this free-time on my hands. Long-story short, I need a car.

Besides dumpster diving and going to foodbanks do you know any ways of financially affording food?

&amp;#x200B;

I simply can not take the past back, its like trying to defeat a stronger force than my life itself. I did have the money but somehow I lost it all and the opportunity to have money forever really, kind of lost the starting engine. If I had I could live off my holdings and savings indefinitely. I do regret but can not do it. Sometimes I do starve but I feel a bit dumb that is just unreal to put myself in that situation when I had the chance to scape, probably forever.

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't want to share this bit due to regret, but I had the chance to get about 1000 btc back in 2012 but somehow I never did it, I feel fucking sliced. I could have lived off those 1000 btc and be infinitely ok, eventually. My job would have been an tip on the ice or something. I know thinking about the past is not going to help me. I had the chance to get a fortune but it passed through me while I couldn't do anything about it, somehow, I can not understand this, even I remember trying to buy this btc back then but somehow not doing it, it's just unexplainable, It's like there is some sort of thing that doesn't let me get saved, If I can not do whats right for me, It looks straight up like some sort of life thing where my life just can not live a proper smart life where everything is ok.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if what happened there was my destiny or I simply not able to get rich in my life, which is not the case, I just can not get why this happened. Imagine having gold and everything you would need in your life in your hands, but somehow it dissapears, you can not explain why, there wasnt anything wrong you did what it had to be done but it just never got to you.  


Maybe is that or maybe is not, It feels like an external force that didnt let me escape my current situation now. Even though that may not be true, how can this happen I still can not explain it. I do relate this to a lot of people that find their salvation and worked hard for it, had the chance with like something else maybe not so btc but the same thing happens, they just dont get it. Knowingly and fully in control of it, it just doesnt happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

the years feel like lashes and it is not good, in 2012 the btc could have saved me, 2013 I had the opportunity to buy more btc and continue somewhow it didnt, 2014, eth came I knew what that was it was about 0.10 per eth, now is almost 300. 2015, similar story but I did nothing, even me trying to get a job it just didnt happen, 2016 I had some bought but lost it all. 2017 despite of my failure I tried again with 4.5 BTC, I lost all of it thinking it was going down to 200 it went to 20K, 2018 I finally given up on this in a way I am severly broke and I cant do anything. 2019 I'm fucking dead.

  
My years are not only about btc, but the fact that I couldnt get hired and a job either to save myself, I've just made 45K in all this time. I finished school in 2010, I made some horrible choices and never got anywhere until 2013 where I got into university, I had some job stuff but somehow never got hired. fast forward 7 years later still broke no cash and no job either.

&amp;#x200B;

You can see a pattern here right? 2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019. It feels like I got shot 9 times in the chest. I still broke even though I got some cash and lost it all somehow. No job and I""ve never being hired before for a real 100K job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25 but since 2012 I have had the chance to save myself but somehow it didnt happen. Look I did make some bad decision but I made very good ones, the fact I knew about this I could have saved myself but I don't know. I dont have a job either, I finished graduate in 2014 and i have tried to get a job that pays 130K, but somehow I have never gotten hired in all these years.

&amp;#x200B;

Shit happens, I just happen to be a guy that just had to be hammered like this, I would need your advice, but I dont have magic powers to fixed all this. This is my story I have been floating out of school since 2010 and 9 years later I am just in shock, how can I be broke, this is just not bad choices only it just has to be something I did in the beginning probably in 2009 when I was in high school, I think I chose the wrong career that got me no where. I see that when a tree is destroyed, the root is damaged. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont want to mention my friends either but it's brutality. most of them are set for life. and they finished in 2014 and got hired, well I didnt and I am a broke shit with no life. If I think about this it has to be simple, I chose the wrong thing i probably wasnt meant to do this. and they were. Is like if you pick the wrong road you cannot see the right destination. Maybe. but this is just crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like I had to be thorough with this so you can just see what I did.  Besides that I am roughly 50K in debt with loans and stuff from the past, my credit is destroyed and I have about 14 accounts in collection, my score is less than 440, I no longer want credit as I have left this, but I have no means of repaying fast as of now. Some of the extra loaned cash I lost with btc. I have lost roughly 6000 in loans with btc. I succeeded with the 4.5 BTC I had I could have pay off everything and still have some if I never moved it, when it hit 20k I could have erased all my debts and the 9 years of craziness could have been fixed.(yes the loan stuff was very bad but it worked, but I lost all of that when it actually worked). I did it but it didnt happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Look I tried and tried but I didnt do it, I lost the loaned money for nothing when If I had the btc it could have pay everything off. sold it off thinking it was going to go 200 but it went 20K.  My situation is far worse than you think but it is within the 50K-100K range so someone that has higher debts probably is in a much worse situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I once had amazing credit it was 728, I had all the 14 accounts 0ed and perfectly done, I had over 20K in credit and I could have amazing stuff now, definitely 810+. But no I destroyed this forever, no fucking way and no i will never use this again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Guys I can not have an income right now, and the amount of money I have is very thin.

I could have lived off those 1000 btc and be infinitely ok, eventually. My job would have been an tip on the ice or something. I know thinking about the past is not going to help me. I had the chance to get a fortune but it passed through me while I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything about it, somehow, I can not understand this, even I remember trying to buy this btc back then but somehow not doing it, it&amp;#39;s just unexplainable, It&amp;#39;s like there is some sort of thing that doesn&amp;#39;t let me get saved, If I can not do whats right for me, It looks straight up like some sort of life thing where my life just can not live a proper smart life where everything is ok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if what happened there was my destiny or I simply not able to get rich in my life, which is not the case, I just can not get why this happened. Imagine having gold and everything you would need in your life in your hands, but somehow it dissapears, you can not explain why, there wasnt anything wrong you did what it had to be done but it just never got to you.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe is that or maybe is not, It feels like an external force that didnt let me escape my current situation now. Even though that may not be true, how can this happen I still can not explain it. I do relate this to a lot of people that find their salvation and worked hard for it, had the chance with like something else maybe not so btc but the same thing happens, they just dont get it. Knowingly and fully in control of it, it just doesnt happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the years feel like lashes and it is not good, in 2012 the btc could have saved me, 2013 I had the opportunity to buy more btc and continue somewhow it didnt, 2014, eth came I knew what that was it was about 0.10 per eth, now is almost 300. 2015, similar story but I did nothing, even me trying to get a job it just didnt happen, 2016 I had some bought but lost it all. 2017 despite of my failure I tried again with 4.5 BTC, I lost all of it thinking it was going down to 200 it went to 20K, 2018 I finally given up on this in a way I am severly broke and I cant do anything. 2019 I&amp;#39;m fucking dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My years are not only about btc, but the fact that I couldnt get hired and a job either to save myself, I&amp;#39;ve just made 45K in all this time. I finished school in 2010, I made some horrible choices and never got anywhere until 2013 where I got into university, I had some job stuff but somehow never got hired. fast forward 7 years later still broke no cash and no job either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see a pattern here right? 2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019. It feels like I got shot 9 times in the chest. I still broke even though I got some cash and lost it all somehow. No job and I&amp;quot;ve never being hired before for a real 100K job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 25 but since 2012 I have had the chance to save myself but somehow it didnt happen. Look I did make some bad decision but I made very good ones, the fact I knew about this I could have saved myself but I don&amp;#39;t know. I dont have a job either, I finished graduate in 2014 and i have tried to get a job that pays 130K, but somehow I have never gotten hired in all these years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shit happens, I just happen to be a guy that just had to be hammered like this, I would need your advice, but I dont have magic powers to fixed all this. This is my story I have been floating out of school since 2010 and 9 years later I am just in shock, how can I be broke, this is just not bad choices only it just has to be something I did in the beginning probably in 2009 when I was in high school, I think I chose the wrong career that got me no where. I see that when a tree is destroyed, the root is damaged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont want to mention my friends either but it&amp;#39;s brutality. most of them are set for life. and they finished in 2014 and got hired, well I didnt and I am a broke shit with no life. If I think about this it has to be simple, I chose the wrong thing i probably wasnt meant to do this. and they were. Is like if you pick the wrong road you cannot see the right destination. Maybe. but this is just crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like I had to be thorough with this so you can just see what I did.  Besides that I am roughly 50K in debt with loans and stuff from the past, my credit is destroyed and I have about 14 accounts in collection, my score is less than 440, I no longer want credit as I have left this, but I have no means of repaying fast as of now. Some of the extra loaned cash I lost with btc. I have lost roughly 6000 in loans with btc. I succeeded with the 4.5 BTC I had I could have pay off everything and still have some if I never moved it, when it hit 20k I could have erased all my debts and the 9 years of craziness could have been fixed.(yes the loan stuff was very bad but it worked, but I lost all of that when it actually worked). I did it but it didnt happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look I tried and tried but I didnt do it, I lost the loaned money for nothing when If I had the btc it could have pay everything off. sold it off thinking it was going to go 200 but it went 20K.  My situation is far worse than you think but it is within the 50K-100K range so someone that has higher debts probably is in a much worse situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once had amazing credit it was 728, I had all the 14 accounts 0ed and perfectly done, I had over 20K in credit and I could have amazing stuff now, definitely 810+. But no I destroyed this forever, no fucking way and no i will never use this again.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope this post provides enough information to help us make a good decision! Let me know if I can be more clear about anything.

My partner earns 38k/ year. I earn roughly 34.5k/year. Collectively, we pull in about 72.5k +/- 1k due to my being hourly.

My partner has roughly 5k in CC debt, whereas I have 3k. I do not pay interest on my CC debt as I move this balance around every 18-22months while taking advantage of promotional 0% APR balance transfer periods. Usually they'll charge a fee of 2-3% to transfer (I have only done this once so far, but intend to keep doing it until I've paid of my debt. I was at 8k, now at 3k w/o interest...woohoo!) My partner DOES pay high interest on his CC debt.

My partner and I bought a home last year and currently pay $2.4k/mo ($2.1k mortgage, $300 PMI). We have a roommate who rents a single room (of 3) for $600/month, making our monthly payment $1800 between the two of us. We have 12% LTV on a 365k loan for the house.

We were recently gifted 18K with the idea that it would be used for a new (used) car. We are currently driving a 2002 Chevy Trailblazer and it just passed 100k miles in January, and has been a huge pain in the ass ever since. We have put in 1.5k in repairs since January, but of course it's hard to know if the car will continue to cause problems or if it was coincidental that the issues started around the same time. We are definitely interested in purchasing a new car with this money, but we are not interested in a monthly payment.

Before we dive into car shopping and committing that money for that purpose...is there anything else we may want to consider doing with the money? It's a vague question, I know, but I'm wondering what other ideas there are to do with a large sum of money that we may never see again. We have never had this type of money to spend and are looking to determine how to most responsibly use it.

I got the idea that I could take a personal loan, pay off the 401k loan, and then turn around and take out a new 401k loan to payoff the personal loan and some credit card debt. I know 401k loans are not a great idea, but i already had one, so it didn't seem terrible.


So I paid off the 401k loan and currently have the following:
1. $5000.00 personal loan @ 18.25% for 36 months 
2. $3500 credit card balance @ 26.98%
(and yes, I know the rates are ridiculous)


I originally planned on taking a $8500 401k loan at 6.5% for 59 months so the payment would be $168.00 per month, but now I'm second guessing myself. In pure numbers, it makes sense, but it feels like I am making it too easy on myself. I shouldn't have let my credit card balance get so high (currently maxed out) and a ""get out of jail free"" card doesn't teach me anything. 


Other ideas: 
1. Pay loans as they are now - 191.00 to personal loan + whatever I can to credit card [min ~$100.00]
2. Take a 401k loan for $5000 just to pay off the personal loan. Payment: $100 - $155 for 401K loan (59 or 36 months) and all else to credit card
3. Take 401K loan for $3500 and pay off credit card only. Lower credit limit and cut up card itself. Payment: $191 to personal loan for 36 months and $70-$110 for 401K loan

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I can devote significant amount of time to study investment and become an expert that can get high rates of return, so I am wondering what are some lower risk strategies someone in my situation can take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that higher return = higher risk, so I am having unreal expectations about investing here, just hoping someone can points me to some directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much, I appreciate any help, thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;

My girlfriend works full time 40hrs a week but makes less than me (about 13.50/hr) and she has rent (500$/month, she covers all utilities, roughly 300$/month, and chips in for groceries when she can.

My credit score fluctuates anywhere from 630-660 depending on what I do during the month. Me and my girlfriend want to get married and get a house of our own in the next 1-3 years and I really want to be rid of all of this crap before than and raise my score + have some money for a sizable down payment. 

I have nothing in savings I can reach for unless someone wants cobwebs. I used to try and save $50/paycheck but I always end up just needing it for something. We only order out maybe 1-2 times a month unless I get a really good check we’ll occasionally add an extra “treat” in there. 

I moved from CA to UT a year ago and while that has helped me the biggest help was my dad giving me $4k to pay down my credit card and other loans (Chase was over 4k before and PayPal close to 8k) so I can’t ask him for any more help with money. I’ve definitely made some stupid money moves in the past couple of years here and am paying for it now. I’m not drowning, but I am just barely floating here.

So, I’m 17 years old currently, obviously in high school and I’m going to be going to Pre Medical for university to hopefully get into Medical school and become a doctor. I do have a summer job right now paying around $15/hr (mind you, this is in Canada, taxes are bs, especially in my province) this is my first job but don’t plan on getting one once school starts so I don’t have to stress on pulling all-nighters to get good grades. I am not the smartest or don’t know much about taxes or anything, I do have a bank that I don’t use much. 

Real question: 

So, I obviously live with my mother and we aren’t the best off in terms of money, my mom struggles to make ends meet every month a lot so she has had loans, I haven’t gotten a clue on how much. She is pretty good with properly putting her money where it matters. But, I’ll skip the sad part of things. But she has been telling me that she is sick and how amazing my life will be once she passes. But she said this should be around my early to mid 20’s. She said i should have around $500,000. But I don’t know what I’d do with it. I’m planning on putting about a 1/4 of that in a savings account for an emergency fund and the rest I’ll be fooling around with in terms of paying off any types of debt that is passed onto me. And hopefully trying to move that into paying off my pre medical schooling and using the rest for living. But besides that, I don’t know when my mom will pass, it could be any day. And another thing is we have two vehicles, should I sell one? I haven’t gotten a clue.

Sorry for the long text but I am getting a lot of stress put onto me, just because she mentions this just about everyday. I want to be prepared on how to move my money, call me an asshole but my family hasn’t helped my mother so I don’t plan on giving a dime to any family members.

I've been working my first web development job for the last 7 months at a startup that doesn't have very much funding.  I only make about $12 an hour but I'm also a 1099 employee working from home.  My monthly expenses come to around $1050 and depending on how many hours I put in, I make about $1800 a month.  I have $2500 in credit card debt, and $9000 in a student loan.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  As a 1099 employee,  how much should I expect to have to pay in taxes? 
2. Working from home,  what kind of things can I write off?  I've been saving all of my receipts for things I can attribute to work (web cam, a new monitor) but what else would I be able to write off?
3. My first thought would be to pay off my debts asap.  Is this the direction I want to go? 
4. Should I open a solo 401K or a Roth IRA account?  Who would I open one through?

as a side note, I am putting feelers out for other positions as I know I'm being paid less than half the average starting salary of a web developer in my area.

&amp;#x200B;

A family member of mine has suffered lately from some severe mental health issues and is making very poor financial decisions.  One of those involved not making payments on a HELOC taken out just prior to a divorce proceeding.   The house was owned outright before taking the loan and is worth about $300K. The HELOC is $80K up from an original amount of $50K.   Due to the mental illness issue, the family member believed they did not have to pay back the loan even though it was ordered as part of the divorce decree from the Judge.   There may have been an intention of spite at the ex to affect their credit by not paying since they were jointly on the HELOC.   The ex is not on the title. 

&amp;#x200B;

The mentally ill family member has very little income and can't keep up with HELOC payments or other bills.   The rest of the family is considering filing a motion to obtain guardianship and attempt to settle some debts, lawsuits etc.    One thing we're wondering about is whether a HELOC settlement is possible.   From what I've read typically, loans secured by a house are not good candidates for settlement negotiations since the lender has recourse to foreclosure.   But if the family member filed Chapter 13, there would seem to be some leverage to negotiate.    Although it doesn't matter too much, the bank in question may have colluded with the ex to get themselves added to the title which was rejected by the family member in question....a precursor event to the subsequent divorce.  So the attempt was made but blocked.

&amp;#x200B;

In any case,  question for the sub: under what circumstances would a bank negotiate a HELOC settlement?  Based on what I described above, would that possibly work in this case? If yes, how would one go about it--work with a local banker to orchestrate everything or call into the national HELOC office (this is a major bank--Wells Fargo--if it matters). 

&amp;#x200B;

Second question if you have any experience with guardianship matters in Arizona: how far gone mentally does a person  need to be in order to obtain guardianship in your experience?  

&amp;#x200B;

Happy to answer any questions to provide more context or if the query seems unclear.  Thanks so much.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location: Arizona&lt;/p&gt;

I graduated last December and landed a well paying job. I have saved up, worked on my credit score and now ready to buy a new car. The problem is I am working with Optional Practical Training (OPT) Employment Authorization Document (EAD) which will expire in 7 months. It will get renewed for me 2 more years as a STEM student. My company is impressed by my work and said they will sponsor for H1B Visa. That gives me 3 years of employment authorization and possibly more if I get H1B visa.

&amp;#x200B;

My Question: Is it wise to lease the car for 3 years, save up and buy out  or finance for 4 years?

Yes I know I'm young and still have a min to figure everything out. Here's where it gets rough though. I deal with untreated chronic pain due to old injuries (and hopefully not something else ) and can't find a job that I can stay in let alone like, and make money in (I've been working in a kitchen for $9/hr for the last year ...I'm aware that due to what Im doing  I'm very underpaid.) I just bought a car for $7000 that I'm making small affordable payments on just to build credit with, but currently making only around $800 every month really won't cut it for buying a house ( which is what I would prefer to do as rent where I am, is to high to not be paying to own the place )

I live in a tourist economy in northern Indiana. Jobs like mine that are year round simply don't pay out and jobs like my SO's that are seasonal do... But only for 3 months out of the year and that's no where near stable ( he's gunna be out of a job in late August again ). 

I know that in order to be able to do what I want to we will both need to have more income but I guess I don't know how or where to start. I'm just starting to feel quite hopeless and lost as someone that at 23 has days she can't get out of bed due to chronic pain, this makes me unable to work any kind of manufacturing , warehouse  or otherwise physical labor which tend to make the most money for us who don't have a college degree up here. I need something that embrasses my Creative talent and attention to detail in order to be mentally ok as well. Which is why I like cooking kinda but would definitely appreciate something that's easier on my body. I definitely don't have the money or time available to go to school , and even if I did have all of that available, anything I would want to go for just doesn't cut it for income in the end. Like ok ..  I've always wanted to be a florist ... 11k a year and that's commission pay ... That's less than I make now and requires college education. And forget making money as an artist , the market is incredibly over saturated and I have no idea how to make anything digital , I could remedy that by saving up and buying a drawing pad and learning it but that $1000 to try to break into the same super over saturated market. If anyone has any ideas on this I'd be open ... But the answer is actually probably moving which I can't afford to do unless anyone has some online suggestions that could supplement my income. I just feel so out of place and un-needed in current society.

The current plan I guess is to try to find a house to fix up that's really really cheap and maybe needs alot of work that we can do gradually. We would like to find a place in South West Michigan but don't know much about there housing laws and taxes. Or really even if it's a good idea to take on something we know needs work. 
Lately I've felt not suicidal ( dont come at me with that I like being alive ) but like giving up. I feel like I've been sprinting in place for a very long time and don't really know where to go from here and I'm so tired. I'm not one to just jump into things.

FICO credit score is 717, recently lowered from about 740 due to 3 hard inquiries. Credit score was based solely on an authorized user credit card I've been using and paying off fully for over a decade (thanks mom). Foolishly thought I could apply for higher end cards due to my high credit score, but had 2 credit card rejections before finally getting approved for the citi doublecash card today with over $5000 limit. This is my first individual credit card and I hope to use it to build my credit as much as possible prior to applying for a home loan.

So my plan right now is to move in to my first home in 1-2 years max (depending on overtime availability, future raises, and finding a home in my price range). 

Step 1.) I'll be moving all my expenses over to the citi double cash card from my debit card so I can get 2% back + start building my credit for mortgage application in a year or so + I'd like to get more specialized cash back credit cards down the line once I'd actually be accepted for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 2.) Moving all my current savings over to a BBVA money market account for 2.5% interest and a $100 bonus. This seems like the best place to put my money currently because I like having the freedom to withdraw the money sooner than 1 year in case i manage to save more than I expect over this next year (excludes 1 year CD accounts) and the $100 bonus is better than the extra .07% interest I'd get with weatherfront given my time frame for savings.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 3.) Once I have 20% down available for my first home + a decent emergency fund, I'll purchase my first home! I'll try to get the lowest 30  year fixed rate mortgage I can.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 4.) Once I have moved out and adjusted my budget to living alone (food, mortgage payment, utilities, etc) I'd like to get more cashback credit cards to cover the categories I spend most in with more cashback. Uber card for restaurants, Ducks unlimited for gas, Amazon for Amazon, and the Blue cash preferred for groceries ( I eat a lot).

&amp;#x200B;

Step 5.) Ultimate long term goal of paying off this home and keeping it as a rental property for additional income while I move on to another home to have a family and kids (way long term right now).

&amp;#x200B;

Some things I'm still unsure about:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) My credit profile and its relevance for future mortgage applications. I have never had any installment loans, and the only thing on my credit report right now is my 10+ year authorized user account with very small purchases made on it over the years.

\- Will my newly acquired citi double cash card be enough for me to establish credit prior to applying for mortgages in a   
year or so? Should I be doing more? 

\-My friend recommended I carry a balance for about 6 months since I have 0% intro APR for 18 months and then pay it   
off to improve my credit even more. Is this a good idea? 

\-Should I be applying for even more credit cards before I buy my first home?

2.) Is there anything else I can be doing right now in general to better my financial future besides just earning as much and saving as much as possible? All ideas are welcome! 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, I have really enjoyed actually having enough income to warrant organizing over the past couple weeks and have really enjoyed geeking out about my finances.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I little about me. I&amp;#39;m 25, still living with my parents, only assets are my car and my motorcycle (both bought with cash). 0 debt and have never had any debt. Recently acquired my first real job and want to stop burdening my parents financially, but would like to do so in the most financially responsible way possible. Parents love having me around but I am definitely feeling like I&amp;#39;m getting too old to be living at home, I&amp;#39;m happy to have the income now to comfortably move out.  I just want to utilize this lack of rent/food expense life for a little longer to set myself up in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FICO credit score is 717, recently lowered from about 740 due to 3 hard inquiries. Credit score was based solely on an authorized user credit card I&amp;#39;ve been using and paying off fully for over a decade (thanks mom). Foolishly thought I could apply for higher end cards due to my high credit score, but had 2 credit card rejections before finally getting approved for the citi doublecash card today with over $5000 limit. This is my first individual credit card and I hope to use it to build my credit as much as possible prior to applying for a home loan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my plan right now is to move in to my first home in 1-2 years max (depending on overtime availability, future raises, and finding a home in my price range). &lt;/p&gt;

So I'm not entirely sure if this is r/personalfinance material. Mods, please remove if not. TLDR at bottom. 

Basically, I'm in grad school online part time and I work full time in MA. For my field, I actually get really great pay. My husband is moving back to TX in a few weeks. I've been applying for jobs back home in TX since February and haven't gotten a single interview. I want to stay in MA and continue working full time with a guaranteed paycheck until September. I have a scholarship for fall semester so I won't have to worry about tuition payments come September so I think it will be better to be unemployed/job search then vs. move back with my husband and be unemployed for who knows how long while I still need to recoup the cost of summer tuition (3k) which I did not have a scholarship for.

My husband will be living with his parents and I'll be living out of my car/on friend's couches to avoid double housing costs while we're apart/allow me to maximize my savings from my paychecks. 

I have zero student loan debt from undergrad and I'm paying for grad school in cash installments so no debt there either.  I have no car payments and my husband has maybe 1800 in credit card debt but that's really it. I was going to pay his cc debt off in full once my bank account recovered from my summer tuition.

I think it will be easier to get a job back in TX once I'm there but I'm afraid of how long it may take. I'm incredibly unexcited about separating from my husband and dog for a month while living in my car/couch hopping but I feel like I have to do it in order to maintain our savings trajectory. 

I can't afford to pay someone to review my resume/cover letter right now but once my campus is officially back in session, I'll be able to schedule a virtual appointment with the career center. This is at the top of my to do list.

So, what I'm here for is - what would y'all do in this situation? Would you move back at the end of July without a job lined up but with the possibility it will be easier to find one once you're actually there or would you stay in MA for another month, give yourself a little extra time to find a job, and move back come September even if you don't have a job lined up? Either way I'm likely facing unemployment for a while, just don't know when would be best to deal with it. Rip the band-aid off or do the slow pull? 

TLDR: Haven't found job back home yet, no debt payments to worry about, summer tuition already paid in full but bank account not recovered yet, I have a scholarship for fall semester so no payments to worry about come September.

I am working my first job, will net me around $2K by the end of the summer before Uncle Sam takes its cut, and I'm somewhat lost about how I'm going to keep the money until I need it.

I have these accounts now:

* 0.25% APY checking
* 1% APY savings
* UTMA Custodial brokerage (plan is to put it all into SWYNX, ""Schwab Target 2060 Index Fund"")

The checking &amp; savings accounts are joint with my parents (they're not the type of parents that'll take my money) and yes, I'll pull all the funds into an individual account when I turn 18.

I have no expenses as of the moment. Parents already have a 529 paying for 4 years of in-state tuition so I'll probably be saving for other expenses during that time.

I have around $400 in the checking, $3-4K in the savings, and $1.5K in the brokerage right now (no pay received yet).

Questions:

* I'm thinking about a 10%/40%/50% split between checking/savings/brokerage, does this sound good? Or is something else better? Or is this too ambitious/liberal? Or is this too conservative?
* IRAs? What's the difference between a custodial Roth IRA and the UTMA account I have above? From what I understand, the money put in is tax-paid so does an IRA exempt me from paying taxes on earnings?
* Taxes at the end of the year: do I have to file my own return or will it be filed under my parents? If I file by myself, could I use IRS Freefile? The job is not under-the-table, I filled out a W9. Am I taxed at my parents rate; if so, is it better for me to file by myself when considering the child tax credit (or talk to a CPA)?
* My local credit union is offering a 2% APY account up to $1500 then 0.1% afterwards. Is it worth it to create an account and transfer ~$1400 to it?
* Anything else I'm missing that's really obvious?

&lt;p&gt;I am working my first job, will net me around $2K by the end of the summer before Uncle Sam takes its cut, and I&amp;#39;m somewhat lost about how I&amp;#39;m going to keep the money until I need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have these accounts now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.25% APY checking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1% APY savings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UTMA Custodial brokerage (plan is to put it all into SWYNX, &amp;quot;Schwab Target 2060 Index Fund&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The checking &amp;amp; savings accounts are joint with my parents (they&amp;#39;re not the type of parents that&amp;#39;ll take my money) and yes, I&amp;#39;ll pull all the funds into an individual account when I turn 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no expenses as of the moment. Parents already have a 529 paying for 4 years of in-state tuition so I&amp;#39;ll probably be saving for other expenses during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have around $400 in the checking, $3-4K in the savings, and $1.5K in the brokerage right now (no pay received yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;

Per the new policy the company will only contribute based on last day rules. Meaning they’ll only contribute at the last day of the year, but they also have the discretion to not pay anything.

If I leave the company before end of year, I will not get the matching contribution. But if I remain employed at the time they will make the contribution, but they also have the right to not make any payment into my plan account. And any delayed payments are deferred until the last day of next year! 

Based on what I think they’re doing, is making  a system where they are no longer allowing pay increases at my company, and using the 401-K contribution to act like the bonus or merit increase. “Well, we did make the benevolent decision to contribute to your retirement account this year, so no real need to consider you for a bonus or merit increase. Can’t be greedy.” 

But the retirement plan is a job benefit as a condition to working there, not an award. Benefits are not supposed to be subject to job performance or merit. It’s a benefit I should automatically receive without hinderance or review. This is bullshit.

I currently rent, but I have enough money to buy a $600k piece of property, and if necessary I'd have enough salary to pay for the mortgage by myself.

Having a condo in a downtown area would be really nice and has long been a goal of mine. But I don't consider it to be a savvy financial move. More of a lifestyle choice, and I don't think I have enough wealth saved up to do something like that yet.

The alternative is to buy a house in a suburb, and rent out part of it. The ideal situation for me would be a duplex, where I can live on one of the floors and rent out the other floor. This gives me more control over tenants, and it will help me to pay off the mortgage sooner which means in a few years I can then convert it to a total rental property and *then* buy a condo for myself while also having a rental property.

What happens if I lose a job and have to move to a new city? Then I'd have to worry about finding a new place to live and renting out the house I bought.

Renting has allowed me the flexibility to grow my career. Now that that growth has almost plateaued, it makes sense to me to pick a spot and settle down.

Posting this on behalf of my fiancée. She is currently in pharmacy school with three years to go. She is very fortunate to have a large amount of investments passed down to her and is currently using that to pay for school, it should be enough to get through entirely bearing no major downturn in value. 

A couple years ago her nonexistent credit took a hit from an unpaid medical bill and she has been trying to get it up by opening a credit card (for the first time) and keeping up with the payments. It has helped a little but slowly. 

We’ve been thinking about taking out a private student loan that is interest free but allows small payments while in school. When she graduates the investments would be used to pay off the loan. 

Obviously if the interest is higher than the average return on the investments it’s a bad idea, but if it is similar or lower, could this help her credit? I can Co-sign on the loan as I have good enough credit for a minimum rate (I think). 

In the future, if one of our credits is much worse than the other will that change rates we would qualify for?

The pay is around $60k/year, and the parent company matches 25%/$1 on up to 8% of your personal contribution. I'm going to go ahead and set my contribution to 8% to get the full match, of course. The default fund is Target Date, though, and I'm not sure how best to spread based on the available options. Below, I've included the options on the TransAmerica platform my company uses. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!

Also, on a somewhat related note, I have \~$270k in Federal Direct loans (materially all unsubsidized) @ an average of 6.03%. I'm overwhelmed as I research the potential repayment options. There's the income driven plan (that seems to defer - and I imagine will significantly compound) and there's a forgiveness plan that requires 120 cumulative (not consecutive/subsequent) payments while working at a public or non-profit organization (many hospitals have this status). (I believe there's a discretionary income calc/etc. that goes into determining the monthly payments/annum.) My current residency program is non-profit, and I'll be there at least the next three years. Would it make sense to enroll in this program (with the evident limitations), or are there good refinancing programs that could get that interest rate closer to inflation? Any and all sharing/suggestions/etc. would be extremely appreciated on this front as well!

The pay is around $60k/year, and the parent company matches 25%/$1 on up to 8% of your personal contribution. I&amp;#39;m going to go ahead and set my contribution to 8% to get the full match, of course. The default fund is Target Date, though, and I&amp;#39;m not sure how best to spread based on the available options. Below, I&amp;#39;ve included the options on the TransAmerica platform my company uses. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, on a somewhat related note, I have ~$270k in Federal Direct loans (materially all unsubsidized) @ an average of 6.03%. I&amp;#39;m overwhelmed as I research the potential repayment options. There&amp;#39;s the income driven plan (that seems to defer - and I imagine will significantly compound) and there&amp;#39;s a forgiveness plan that requires 120 cumulative (not consecutive/subsequent) payments while working at a public or non-profit organization (many hospitals have this status). (I believe there&amp;#39;s a discretionary income calc/etc. that goes into determining the monthly payments/annum.) My current residency program is non-profit, and I&amp;#39;ll be there at least the next three years. Would it make sense to enroll in this program (with the evident limitations), or are there good refinancing programs that could get that interest rate closer to inflation? Any and all sharing/suggestions/etc. would be extremely appreciated on this front as well!&lt;/p&gt;

By the end of the month I should have about 9K in savings, but I have no interest in plunging that all into repaying this or settling it as I'd want to be at about 6 months expenses minimum to do so. I have no other debt and my credit is starting to get better.\n\nMy questions are this...\n\n1. If I choose to rehab it will it instantly go back on my credit report and tank it? \n2. How can I get the cheapest repayment terms? Consolidate then REPAYE or IBR? Do I even qualify for IBR at certain income levels? \n3. How should I communicate with Coast Professional? Should I ask them to validate the debt first with a certified letter and then what? Any other tips to protect myself?\n4. If I do contact them will that put me back on their radar and have them speed up the process to garnish my new wage? (Only had this job about 5 months now) Can I defend against garnishment in anyway? Will I get a letter? I've never gotten a letter from Coast Professional at all, never had a phone call. No one is calling or contacting me to collect right now.\n5. Can I get any kind of settlement to get this down or more manageable? \n\nIdeally I just am interested in paying the minimum (until I have 6 months expenses saved) and also waiting for political reform to happen that may open up new options.

They&amp;#39;re owned by Coast Professional right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just started making decent money but I do have decently high rent $2000/mo and a dependent with my disabled mother. By the end of the month I should have about 9K in savings, but I have no interest in plunging that all into repaying this or settling it as I&amp;#39;d want to be at about 6 months expenses minimum to do so. I have no other debt and my credit is starting to get better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My questions are this...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If I choose to rehab it will it instantly go back on my credit report and tank it? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How can I get the cheapest repayment terms? Consolidate then REPAYE or IBR? Do I even qualify for IBR at certain income levels? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How should I communicate with Coast Professional? Should I ask them to validate the debt first with a certified letter and then what? Any other tips to protect myself?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If I do contact them will that put me back on their radar and have them speed up the process to garnish my new wage? (Only had this job about 5 months now) Can I defend against garnishment in anyway? Will I get a letter? I&amp;#39;ve never gotten a letter from Coast Professional at all, never had a phone call. No one is calling or contacting me to collect right now.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Can I get any kind of settlement to get this down or more manageable? &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally I just am interested in paying the minimum (until I have 6 months expenses saved) and also waiting for political reform to happen that may open up new options.

&amp;#x200B;

I come to you regarding negotiating a pay rise at my current job, some of the things regarding arguments are specific to myself and my position but still it's worth noting. This time I do not seek help, but would like to share some info since it's all the things I learned out here.

I've been at this job for several years now (engineering) - as a part time job, helping during college and a year after graduating. Everytime my pay got changed, it was in reaction to my value changing (e.g. getting a masters) but still undervalued compared to what other companies could give me. Everytime this happened I was disappointed.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned a few tips here that seem to be the only ones that work:

* Go to job interviews - it's best to find a good job while you have current one + what can happen at worst is you get better at interviews by training and visiting multiple of them
* Try finding average pay of your job position - use glassdoor or your country's equivalent
* Work better than others - multiple factors - enthusiasm, time spent, activity, willing to participate in work and projects outside of your job description (For this I created a spreadsheet of things I did outside of my job description + also a decent chunk of plans of activities for the future, that might be interesting for the company)
* Treat negotiating as a business, they do as well - usually, the company won't pay you more unless they have to, even if you work hard for dozens of years. Tackle it as a business with no hard feelings but genuine interest in making the agreement work. Sometimes the company truly doesn't have enough money, sometimes it's just them negotiating from a better position.

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of unethical, but justifiable: Since my contract was a one year one with plans to change the contract to a regular one afterwards, I didn't have to put my two weeks in (actually two months in my country). I worked hard and did extra tasks and filled my spreadsheet with interesting plans and I waited in silence. Meanwhile I attended job interviews, landing a couple of decent offers for better pay, but I wanted to work for this company, only for adequate pay. Just as my contract was nearing to end, I approached my superiors regarding future collaboration. When a question of changing pay came out, the manager was ready with his arguments, nearly saying I don't do enough work. Not only I had my spreadsheet ready to help me with argumentation, I also had complete offers for jobs paying more and was ready to just stop coming to work in a couple of days. When I mentioned the pay I would need to at least counterbalance different offers, they realized they cannot pay me the sum of money offered elsewhere. Now the more specific, at this point I'm in quite valuable for my company and they genuinely don't have money for adequate salaries for their workers, but they seemed to work hard with higher ups to manage a counterbalance offer with nearly the same pay compared to my different job offers. Now that both sides know I can leave pretty much anytime for interesting pay, while being a quite valuable asset here, the negotiation goes better for me.

TL:DR: While undervalued I negotiated a 40% pay rise following tips from this subreddit. Thanks a lot guys!

EDIT: formatting","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come to you regarding negotiating a pay rise at my current job, some of the things regarding arguments are specific to myself and my position but still it&amp;#39;s worth noting. This time I do not seek help, but would like to share some info since it&amp;#39;s all the things I learned out here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been at this job for several years now (engineering) - as a part time job, helping during college and a year after graduating. Everytime my pay got changed, it was in reaction to my value changing (e.g. getting a masters) but still undervalued compared to what other companies could give me. Everytime this happened I was disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a few tips here that seem to be the only ones that work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to job interviews - it&amp;#39;s best to find a good job while you have current one + what can happen at worst is you get better at interviews by training and visiting multiple of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try finding average pay of your job position - use glassdoor or your country&amp;#39;s equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work better than others - multiple factors - enthusiasm, time spent, activity, willing to participate in work and projects outside of your job description (For this I created a spreadsheet of things I did outside of my job description + also a decent chunk of plans of activities for the future, that might be interesting for the company)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat negotiating as a business, they do as well - usually, the company won&amp;#39;t pay you more unless they have to, even if you work hard for dozens of years. Tackle it as a business with no hard feelings but genuine interest in making the agreement work. Sometimes the company truly doesn&amp;#39;t have enough money, sometimes it&amp;#39;s just them negotiating from a better position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit of unethical, but justifiable: Since my contract was a one year one with plans to change the contract to a regular one afterwards, I didn&amp;#39;t have to put my two weeks in (actually two months in my country). I worked hard and did extra tasks and filled my spreadsheet with interesting plans and I waited in silence. Meanwhile I attended job interviews, landing a couple of decent offers for better pay, but I wanted to work for this company, only for adequate pay. Just as my contract was nearing to end, I approached my superiors regarding future collaboration. When a question of changing pay came out, the manager was ready with his arguments, nearly saying I don&amp;#39;t do enough work. Not only I had my spreadsheet ready to help me with argumentation, I also had complete offers for jobs paying more and was ready to just stop coming to work in a couple of days. When I mentioned the pay I would need to at least counterbalance different offers, they realized they cannot pay me the sum of money offered elsewhere. Now the more specific, at this point I&amp;#39;m in quite valuable for my company and they genuinely don&amp;#39;t have money for adequate salaries for their workers, but they seemed to work hard with higher ups to manage a counterbalance offer with nearly the same pay compared to my different job offers.

My husband and I bought our first home in Colorado a few years ago. Our mortgage and title are both under my father-in-law’s name.  But for all practical purposes, its our home. From what I understand, if we go to sell the house we would be facing a capital gains tax since FIL is not using this home as his primary residence. 

It seems like a way to avoid this tax would be to transfer the title to us. But we are concerned that this may compromise the good mortgage rate he got for us, and perhaps include other hefty costs.

We don't have an exact timeline for purchasing another home, but this is definitely a big factor. Even in the scenario of us keeping this home as a rental property (which is our goal), the fact that its under FIL’s name seems to pose limitations (maybe some we’re not even aware of yet).

Any advise or comments on how we could sell this house with minimal penalty?

What is the extra $75.00 here? Is this the fee to purchase? Sorry if this is a dumb question, but the Fidelity site doesn't specify and I can't figure out why it says ""$2,500.00 minimum investment"" but then requires a $2575 minimum in reality.

I'm 27 (M) and roughly make 40k a year. I put 6% to my company Roth 401k as that is required for company match. I would like to do a Roth IRA as well via schwab and that SWYJX would be sufficient enough for that. $6k is to much for me to max every year so as a side note, how much additional money should I be putting into that Roth IRA every year as well as the 6% to the roth 401k.

Maybe I'm being naive, but I still think that apartments are the better way to go. I've had apartments down at school before and was able to manage them fine on a much lower income.

I want to be able to start saving money to be able to use for a down payment for a home someday, but I know that I have a lot to learn until I can do that. 

I would like to start by saving money in general, especially for an emergency fund (for vet, unexpected issues in the future, whatever I will need it for) but the problem is I am not sure what would be appropriate for me to start saving if that makes sense? I dont even know where to put any money I want to save, like do I physically have to hold it?

I have several issues:

I'm on disability assistance, though I hope to not need it someday at all and really dislike it, I get monthly payments that range from 600-1200 depending on how much I work that month. 

The real issue here is because of being on assistance, I'm not allowed to save more than $5,000, which seems totally ludacris to me as not all people on disability support are aiming to stay on it and I am mainly on it just to help cover my HIGH medical costs and medication. I wouldnt be able to afford it on my own. I hate that I cannot save much and plan to get off as soon as I can, but it is what it is.

I have two methods  income. I work at a company doing illustration and graphic design for clients and sometimes some Freelance, as well as work nights part time as a grocery clerk just stocking shelves (the physical stimulation and lack of customers is what I was looking for) where I can make up to 2,400 a month overall from these.

Because of that, I usually dont get much more than about 600 a month from assistance, which is more than enough but since I'm going back to university for another advancement in my degree, there is a rule that apparently they cannot touch my disability income for the 2 months before school starts, meaning I'll be getting about 1200 both these months before this September no matter the amount I make.

My boyfriend that I live with is very supportive and makes a decent pay as well, though is more traditional when it comes to saving and so his advice although appreciated, has not been applicable for me. He just kind of puts money away whenever, but I need schedule and specific numbers if possible.

He helps me physically in the sense that he comes with me to banks, public places etc. To help with things and make sure I dont have miscommunication or issues (I've been kicked out of a bank before after a meltdown due to not knowing where to stand). He can help me with this along the way and is very loving and supporting.

I am sorry if my grammar and proper speech is lacking, I am very anxious about asking for help and this is very hard for me to do. I dont even know what questions to ask. Been debating posting here for a while on my old account.

It is truly the place i want to retire to when i am older (currently 21). 


https://imgur.com/a/iOmNwGD

It is a 2 hectares area, there’s a famous resort club build near and many other big houses that do front the beach. There is a lot of other unused land and i don’t believe it would garner too much value if any.

I’d buy it purely to have a resting place for the future, i still live with my parents and i have not finished my degree yet.

Building the house i want to have would cost me about 40k of which i’d only have half after buying the deed, 40k is moneywhich i am not willing to spend outright since i don’t have any need right now to move or have my own property.

I am aware i could leave my money on bank noes for a yearly 3% and not pay property taxes (although very low) for the next 10 years and make bank compared to locking in money.

Thoughts? Maybe something better to do with the money?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings pf, i’ve come across this piece of land that seems to god to be true as it had its price cut from 64k to 22k, the land is in a very secluded area, 2 hours away from my country’s capital, it is surrounded by the prettiest scenery i have ever seen and it is a place i actively visit throughout the month as a resting place during week days. It is truly the place i want to retire to when i am older (currently 21). &lt;/p&gt;

The wiki and general wisdom floating around here has really helped me learn to manage my finances over the past few years since graduating college and entering the working world.

For the past three years I’ve lived in the same apartment, and worked the same job, living off an annual salary which I was payed monthly, and thus budgeting was quite easy. By following some of the general rules regarding what you should spend on housing, transportation, savings, etc. (and applying it to my situation I really got my budget down to a very precise science).

I am now about to begin a masters program, and am not exactly sure how some of the standard advice applies to graduate students. I’ve made a budget for the next year (although there are still a few unknowns), and was hoping someone here could give it a quick look and tell me if there’s anything obvious that I’m doing wrong. My biggest worry is housing (by extension utilities as well) as I’ve said in the title, because I’m worried that I’m spending too much here.


My current debts, assets, etc:

Emergency Fund: $5,000 (roughly 3 months)
Foreign Pension Fund: $8,000 (I can withdraw this penalty free, and will do so soon and place it somewhere in the US, possibly an IRA)
Checking Account: $2,000 

Federal Student Loan Debt: $60,000 (Interest at an average of 5.8%.  From undergrad. I did not make the best choices as an undergraduate, and knowing what I know now probably could have escaped with far less debt, but what’s done is done and I’m left with this horrible number..)

Credit Score: ~ 700



Monthly Income (once beginning graduate school), post tax:

Total: $1,600

Graduate Stipend: $600 (this comes with full tuition waiver as well)

Graduate Stafford Loans: $600 (I plan on taking $7,200 a year in loans, although I’m feeling if possible I should reduce this number..

Freelance/part time work: $400 (I do some stuff online (teaching English, freelance translation) for some extra money. I could theoretically increase this number but I want to focus on my studies..)

Monthly Expenses: 

Total: $1,585

Rent: $550 (a great one bedroom apartment. I have not yet signed the lease though, still deciding..)

Electric: $100 (this is a pretty rough estimate, maybe high)

Water: $30

Internet: $70

Phone: $60

Transportation: $50 (I won’t own a car. I’ll primarily bike but will occasionally need to take buses).

Health Insurance: $240

Groceries: $150 (sort of a rough estimate, as I’m not too familiar with prices in this city. For better or worse though, I eat more than almost anyone I know)

Gym: $15 (great gym on campus)

Fun money: $100 

Savings: $150 

Vacation Fund: $50

Miscellaneous: $20


So my main concern is housing. I’m really happy with the apartment I’ve found, but realistically if I had roommates I could be living a lot cheaper and reduce the amount of loans I’m currently taking. For example, i have the opportunity to live in a 4 bedroom house with three other people and pay $350 a month, with all utilities included. That would save me nearly $5,000 a year... those kind of savings are hard to turn down, especially when I’m taking out $7,000 per year in loans. That said though, I had roommates in college and it was fun, but I’ve been living alone for the past three years and I love it so, so much and I think it would really impact my quality of life and ability to work effectively if I lived with multiple roommates. I realize that sounds a bit pampered, but sort of just how I feel.. 

A couple additional points: I’ll be graduating with $75,000 in debt if I take out the loans I’m planning on. I should get a job post graduation making $55,000-$65,000. Within 5 years I should be making around $85,000 and by the ten year mark there’s a lot of variance.. I could still be hovering around the $85,000 mark but could also very well be making much more than that (150,000+?).  I’m 27 years old. Did a lot of screwing around in college and got a bit of a late start to adulting.

I was told by the finance manager that 2 out of the 3 banks declined to provide finance due to high debt-to-income ratio. I sign the paperwork and drive off with the car.

On July 5th, I called the salesperson back and was that they don't have a copy of the handwritten credit application. I was forwarded to the finance manager and was told that they were certain that the income was submitted to the banks as $8,000 monthly. I decide to call the bank loan underwriter that finalize the loan and was told that the dealership actually submitted the income as $800 monthly. They knew the loan would not get approved so without contacting the dealership to verify they assumed it was an error and added an extra zero at the end.

The interest rate on the loan is higher than any of my previous auto loans and the finance manager also extended the term of the loan to get a lower interest rate. I decided to get the payoff details and closed the loan to stop accruing $6 interest each day.

I was wondering if i may get everyones help on what to do here.

The long story short timeline version is.

1. around june 2018, my mom got a new job. she is eligible to get full benefits after 90 days and if she was full time.

2. the company didnt give her full time until around september? so she kept her insurance under obama care's washington health care.
for couple months (September 2018 onwards, when she got full time employment) she didnt get any notice regarding her benefits kicking in soon and to sign up. so she waited.

3. around november? (RIGHT under 90 days of when she got full time employment) she went to her normal PCP to get an annual check up, under her old insurance (obama care)

4. she gets a notice saying that her insurance is no longer covering her due to her income increase and/or?? new job. (which is odd to us because A. she was working part time befoer sept. B. she didnt get ANY notification)

5. turns out also, she cannot sign up for health insurance with her new company because the deadline to do so ended long ago (at the time when she was part time/less than 90 days since employment).... and thus not eligible, and was denied back then too.

6. we finally got everything sorted and was able to get her covered with her new employer and insurance.

7. now the issue is that we got a bill last week for the annual check up she did on point 3 from LabCorp.

and this is where the confusion starts again....

on 2017 (2 years ago) my mom got hurt at her old job. so she went in and got workmans compensation filled and everything.

now, with her check up she did 11/2018, it somehow ended up with LabCorp first billing her old health insurance (obama care) and once found that it is no longer covering her, LabCorp, by themselves, billed it to something called labor and union health insurance. and the bill came back to us as a workmans compensation paperwork....

how can i get this resolved?? I am still confused on exactly what happened here, and how this happened. As well as why labcorp would just randomly bill it under any company that is under my moms name.

and how can i get this bill covered by my moms current insurance? because the only reason my mom got this check up is because on 11/2018, she and her PCP thought she was still covered by her old health insurance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello.

At the time we separated I had no recent substantial work experience. I've never worked full time in my life, due to serious chronic health issues and being a SAHM. 

I have no college degree, but have a bunch of college credits from unaccredited institutions earned 20-25 years ago. I've been taking a few classes at a local community college to fill in some gaps, take care of prerequisites, and gain skills such as learning more about Microsoft Office Suite while trying to figure out what to do. The community college won't accept many of my credits, so I'm applying to a few other institutions that may accept more of them so that I could complete a degree faster. 

What to get a degree in is a huge question. There are lots of things I'm good at and enjoy, but the health issues are a huge wild card, and I know I can't handle a high-stress job working a lot of hours long-term. 

I'm getting As in the classes I'm taking, my PSAT/SAT scores as a teen were high enough to qualify for significant scholarships, and I haven't used any of my Pell Grants yet. With 2-3 of us in college and my low income, I qualify for substantial financial aid to complete a degree.

Ex and I have 4 children ranging from college-age to preschool (youngest will be entering kindergarten in the fall, oldest will be starting college with enough grants and scholarships to be able to pay the balance with what they can earn working over the summer and a few hours per week during the school year).

Ex makes 6 figures, I had no substantial income during the marriage. I am now working part-time as a caregiver at $15.50 per hour (as of my July 1 raise), grossing about $1200-1400 per month before withholdings. My employer also contributes 50 (I think now becoming 65) cents per hour to a retirement account for me, but I would need to work at least 3 years at this job before the retirement account becomes vested and actually belongs to me. 

We live in a high cost of living area, with very high daycare costs.

I got the family home in the divorce, along with 1 month's living expenses worth each of bank accounts and his retirement fund (a very small percentage of the total) and will owe him money if I sell the house within X number of years. He got all the other joint assets in order to buy him out of his share of the family home, along with substantial assets that were determined to be his separate property. 

I am receiving currently enough child support and alimony to cover our basic living expenses without going into debt if I am frugal, which I am being. The alimony will last for 4 years at this level and then reduce and stop over the next few years. So I have a 4-5 year window of opportunity to get an education and improve my earning power before I have to be able to make enough income to support a family. 

I did refinance the house to get it into my name and get money out for urgent repairs. I own an older used vehicle with well over 200K miles on it--no car payment. 

I am currently living on the child support/alimony and saving almost all of the income from my job in a high-yield savings account, trying to pretend that money doesn't exist in my budgeting but occasionally having to dip into it for emergencies and school expenses.

My only debt is currently the mortgage. Mortgage, utilities and property taxes is close to half of the child support/alimony we're living on, but is about the same I would be paying if I downsized to a 3-bedroom (either rental or purchase) for myself and 4 children. My income isn't high enough to qualify to rent a 3-bedroom as most places around here require 3 times the rent to qualify, so that's part of why I negotiated to keep the house.

It's possible that once our youngest gets a little older I may be able to work full time, but the likelihood that I'll be able to work full time long-term is not high. Many with my health conditions become fully disabled at a young age, and I have been in the past more disabled than I am currently and there is always the chance of relapse. So I am building up as much of a safety net now as I can.

I may have some potential income from the home if I were to rent out extra living space and pasture. The ability/reliability of doing that is questionable though due to various issues.

My question is, what should I be doing with the money I'm saving from working currently? My taxable income is low enough I should owe little to no taxes with 4 dependents filing as head of household. So I'm thinking maybe I should max out my Roth IRA contributions?

If I have some money left over once the most urgent home repairs are done, should I put it into making less urgent repairs and upgrades on the house (i.e. replacing badly worn and outdated stained carpets, or windows that are losing energy efficiency), save for an emergency, invest, or put back into the principle on the home loan?

The loan to value ratio on the mortgage is somewhere around 55-60%. (The house/property is worth almost twice as much as the remaining principle on the loan.) So there is equity in the house, and the LTV ratio is improving as I make payments and property values go up.

I'm currently paying about $35 extra each month to the principal, by rounding my payment up to the next even hundred. My interest rate is 3.875% and I have excellent credit.

Also, what are my best options for being able to make a living enough to support a family on one income either working part-time, or combining earned income with passive income? It cannot be anything highly stressful or physically strenuous, so I'm looking into options like tech, writing and graphic design. I am not opposed to sales, but I need a reliable base salary and health insurance, and am definitely not interested in anything MLM or predatory.

Ex and I were married long enough that I will qualify for part of his social security (if it still exists) once he hits retirement age, even though divorced.

Oh, one more question: Should I be buying life and/or disability insurance on myself, if I can qualify for a policy? There is life insurance on ex that would replace his income until our youngest is in high school, but I am not aware of his having any disability insurance.

The stand in realtor shows up and agrees with me that the home probably wouldn’t meet the requirements for a Hope/FHA loan, even though the sheet says FHA loans were okay. We do not even go inside the house.

However I asked her a few questions about what to look for in pictures, or finding these obvious things out first so I do not waste anybody’s time.

Honestly I do not know quite what to think about the conversation. I mean I should want an inspector who does a good job, but the way this relator made it sound that I would never get a Hope/FHA loan approved with an inspector like that. 

Shouldn’t I want an inspector who will be thorough at his job? I mean the appraiser will just come out later and could note those same problems, and then I am out more money than just the inspection.

&lt;p&gt;The stand in realtor shows up and agrees with me that the home probably wouldn’t meet the requirements for a Hope/FHA loan, even though the sheet says FHA loans were okay. We do not even go inside the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I asked her a few questions about what to look for in pictures, or finding these obvious things out first so I do not waste anybody’s time. Well one thing led to another and we got onto the subject of the inspector I used on the house I liked, and she said from what my realtor told her the person I used was just too nitpicky and likened him to another inspector realtors call the “deal breaker”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly I do not know quite what to think about the conversation. I mean I should want an inspector who does a good job, but the way this relator made it sound that I would never get a Hope/FHA loan approved with an inspector like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shouldn’t I want an inspector who will be thorough at his job? I mean the appraiser will just come out later and could note those same problems, and then I am out more money than just the inspection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is sub’s experiences with home inspections?&lt;/p&gt;

In 2015 I took advantage of an early retirement offer (where I was given two years full pay and benefits) to fulfill a dream of traveling. No regrets there - life is short and it was an amazing opportunity. Plus for years I was tired of the corporate grind and this was my ticket out.

I owe $93,000 in the form of 3 Parent Plus loans. I'm on a 30 year plan, which means if nothing changes, I'll be paying pretty much until I die. My payment is $709/month. I take home $4900 a month from my combined pension/salary ($4000 pension/ $900 salary).

Even though I know it's considered a cardinal sin to withdraw from a 401K to pay off a loan (the interest on this loan was 6.8%), I decided to take a gamble and use the windfall of the past 6 months to pay down this debt. If the market dips significantly, I figure it's money that I saved from losing. At my age, the long hall isn't as long as when I was in my 30's. It may not have been the best decision, but it feels good to have some of this debt relieved.

I work some long hours so don't spend much time at home. But, I'm really looking to move out to get some independence and I feel like my age requires it at this point (24M).

Alternatively, another option besides moving out that I'm also exploring is continuing to live at my parents for a few more years or so and save up enough to put money down to purchase an apartment.

Some basic info to start: 


 I am 30 years old. I make 52k in a new union position at a large company, under current contract this will gradually rise to 75k over 10 years. I don’t have a college degree and don’t feel particularly drawn to getting one so currently plan on staying as long as possible.

Financials: 


I have no debts other than a mortgage. I’m currently working towards a 10k emergency fund. I have 15k in a rollover IRA 2055 target date fund at Vanguard. 2k in the new job’s traditional IRA in another target date at Fidelity.

Questions: 


How strongly should I be racing to catch up my retirement accounts to 1x salary, should I be panicked? 


Does home equity count at all in this equation? 


Following the flowchart, once I complete the emergency fund, the next step is maxing a Roth (which I believe is 6k). That is 11% of my salary, in addition to the 6% 401k contributions, that is 17% of income into retirement. However later in the flowchart it states you should be saving 15% of pre-tax income.

Quick background: I am 29 and I saw my mother struggle raising me her entire life. Growing up my father threatened to kill her if she went after any kind of child support. So she did it on her own, but that also meant we didn't have many things. A lot of times I'd want the new gaming system, the newest toys, etc. But the answer was usually low. I remember one Christmas in 1997 I got a few wooden toys that I could paint on and a few other things and my mom swore she didn't buy them because she couldn't afford it so I just assume our landlady left them for us and she brought them inside. 

Fast forward, 18 married, no job, no car, ended up homeless, got a job making under minimum wage, saved, worked many hours, bought a house with cash. Divorced lost a lot of cash. Got over $8,000 in debt, paid it off, my mom was over $20,000 in debt, helped her pay that off. Paying off credit cards is super easy if you become a minimalist. Now I have $23,000 in stocks, $20,000 in the bank, I own my own house with no mortgage, and everything I do is for my sons future. With that said.

1. If you feel the 9-5 is for you ( definitely not my thing ) but you're in debt, pick up a side gig like he stated in his story. If you're married, can you live off your income alone? if so, then use your income for daily life, food, electric, rent, mortgage, etc and the side gig money, plus your wife/husband's money pays the debt down. 

2. Do you really need that? I personally sell things online a lot, I am a minimalist, I hate things. I hate furniture, I hate almost everything. I personally would like to live in an empty house, with my laptop and a blanket ( no bed ) to sleep on. Nothing else. But I sell things online a lot, which means I have to have things. I buy stuff all the time and resell it and 90% of the time I buy something I think who really needs this? well some crazy person is willing to pay $200 for it, but if I wasn't reselling it I wouldn't pay $1 for it. I don't expect everyone to have a minimalist attitude about life like I do. But you can definitely buy less. You can't take things with you when you die. Everyone finds happiness in their own ways. I suggest finding happiness in looking at your bank grow rather than more stuff you have to hoard. 

3. I love eating out, everyone makes it sound so bad. It's not. Don't even count it in your budget. I don't and never will. You live once and food and travel are the best parts of life, never stop eating things you like. I live a free life, I've been to Asia twice for periods of 1-2 months, South America 11 times mostly over 2 months at a time. I reward myself for hard work with fun traveling. Find other things to cut of your life, like that $300 dollar stroller. Your kids will be cool in a $15 dollar stroller you picked up at a yard sale, put that other $285 in BP stock and collect the dividends, thank me later.

4. Invest in stocks, maybe not now, I think we're near the top, but once you're out of debt start buying a few shares here and there. Warren Buffett said most people won't be able to time the tops and bottoms but America keeps growing, so whenever you have free money throw it in stocks and over the long term you'll do fine. If you don't know much about stocks just buy an ETF like SPY, you'll collect dividends and have exposure to a good variety of the market. 

5. If you own your house and have equity in it and think there's anyway you can downsize, do it. I flip houses, one house I sold recently to a lady was in a decent area that needed a lot of work, she had equity in her house and had saved up some money, so she decided to buy the house with the money she saved up and then sell her house and repair it with the equity money. She now has no house payments. 

6. Be cheap on almost everything. Need a new car? no you don't, buy a used one. Most of the depreciation has already hit. I have 43,000 in the bank basically and drive a car with 240,000 miles on it, my driver side door won't open, and I don't care what people think about me. I have $43k in the bank and they're in debt. Be cheap on bills, I feel just as comfortable using a fan as I do an AC, so I choose the cheaper option. I look at every possible thing I can do to save a dollar. I'm personally cheap on everything besides food and travel. Maybe there's something else you need to enjoy you daily life, so don't forego that, but if it doesn't bring you that much pleasure, cut it out of your life.

7. Stop Amazon, immediately. Do whatever means to find your item cheaper, Amazon charges around 16% in fees, plus shipping isn't free, trust me, I know. I have over $1,500 in gift cards on Amazon and can't find anything on that terrible site I want. I usually convert my GC's into Starbucks gift cards or some other place just because everything on Amazon is honestly way overpriced. And you pay $119 a year to be overcharged. Jeff Bezos must love me right now. But I have sold there in the past and if I buy something for $5 I have to resell it for $17 to even make a few bucks with all their fees. Just go find it for $5 and stay away from Amazon.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw a story on here a few days ago about a man that wrote a long post about how he got out of $16,000 in debt so I thought I&amp;#39;d share my story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick background: I am 29 and I saw my mother struggle raising me her entire life. Growing up my father threatened to kill her if she went after any kind of child support. So she did it on her own, but that also meant we didn&amp;#39;t have many things. A lot of times I&amp;#39;d want the new gaming system, the newest toys, etc. But the answer was usually low. I remember one Christmas in 1997 I got a few wooden toys that I could paint on and a few other things and my mom swore she didn&amp;#39;t buy them because she couldn&amp;#39;t afford it so I just assume our landlady left them for us and she brought them inside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward, 18 married, no job, no car, ended up homeless, got a job making under minimum wage, saved, worked many hours, bought a house with cash. Divorced lost a lot of cash. Got over $8,000 in debt, paid it off, my mom was over $20,000 in debt, helped her pay that off. Paying off credit cards is super easy if you become a minimalist. Now I have $23,000 in stocks, $20,000 in the bank, I own my own house with no mortgage, and everything I do is for my sons future. With that said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel the 9-5 is for you ( definitely not my thing ) but you&amp;#39;re in debt, pick up a side gig like he stated in his story. If you&amp;#39;re married, can you live off your income alone? if so, then use your income for daily life, food, electric, rent, mortgage, etc and the side gig money, plus your wife/husband&amp;#39;s money pays the debt down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you really need that? I personally sell things online a lot, I am a minimalist, I hate things. I hate furniture, I hate almost everything. I personally would like to live in an empty house, with my laptop and a blanket ( no bed ) to sleep on. Nothing else. But I sell things online a lot, which means I have to have things. I buy stuff all the time and resell it and 90% of the time I buy something I think who really needs this? well some crazy person is willing to pay $200 for it, but if I wasn&amp;#39;t reselling it I wouldn&amp;#39;t pay $1 for it. I don&amp;#39;t expect everyone to have a minimalist attitude about life like I do. But you can definitely buy less. You can&amp;#39;t take things with you when you die. Everyone finds happiness in their own ways. I suggest finding happiness in looking at your bank grow rather than more stuff you have to hoard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love eating out, everyone makes it sound so bad. It&amp;#39;s not. Don&amp;#39;t even count it in your budget. I don&amp;#39;t and never will. You live once and food and travel are the best parts of life, never stop eating things you like. I live a free life, I&amp;#39;ve been to Asia twice for periods of 1-2 months, South America 11 times mostly over 2 months at a time. I reward myself for hard work with fun traveling. Find other things to cut of your life, like that $300 dollar stroller. Your kids will be cool in a $15 dollar stroller you picked up at a yard sale, put that other $285 in BP stock and collect the dividends, thank me later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invest in stocks, maybe not now, I think we&amp;#39;re near the top, but once you&amp;#39;re out of debt start buying a few shares here and there. Warren Buffett said most people won&amp;#39;t be able to time the tops and bottoms but America keeps growing, so whenever you have free money throw it in stocks and over the long term you&amp;#39;ll do fine. If you don&amp;#39;t know much about stocks just buy an ETF like SPY, you&amp;#39;ll collect dividends and have exposure to a good variety of the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you own your house and have equity in it and think there&amp;#39;s anyway you can downsize, do it. I flip houses, one house I sold recently to a lady was in a decent area that needed a lot of work, she had equity in her house and had saved up some money, so she decided to buy the house with the money she saved up and then sell her house and repair it with the equity money. She now has no house payments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be cheap on almost everything. Need a new car? no you don&amp;#39;t, buy a used one. Most of the depreciation has already hit. I have 43,000 in the bank basically and drive a car with 240,000 miles on it, my driver side door won&amp;#39;t open, and I don&amp;#39;t care what people think about me.

We can manage this until I start school in September. I'm very confused on what the best idea would be in this situation, though. So I'm just looking for advice on what you guys would do in this situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have been living at our apartment for 4 months (short residency), he's had his job for about 3 months (short time at a job) but he makes about $3200 a month so it's at least a good paying job. We plan on saving up about $1200 for a down payment. His credit is about 525. I was willing to co-sign but my friend said with me having my own couple of open loans, and again having short residency, she doesn't think it'd help much and I'd just be putting myself in a compromising situation (co-signing is always scary it seems lol)

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is my boyfriend thinks that walking into the dealership, cash in hand, hes about to walk out of there with a brand new car. He's ""willing"" to pay a higher monthly payment but I think that's so unnecessary. What if he got injured or lost his job? I don't want to figure out how to pay a $400 car payment lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I'd like to go with my friends idea. Find a smaller dealership, find a car for under $10,000 (less if possible) pay it off, and once his credit is better and hes been at his job for a while, then he can go get his fancy car in a few years lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything you guys can tell me to show him how this works? am I just gonna have to take him into carmax and have them tell him he's not getting what he thinks he is?

Hi yall, I recently started working at my first full time job and they are offering me options for health insurance and they both come with an HSA that allows for the money to roll over year by year and even for me to invest it (idk how common this is but it's a wild concept to me). I get to choose how much to invest, from 0 to the IRS limit and my company will put money into the account regardless of my contribution. Because it's basically free my mom wants me to stay on her insurance and be on my company's health insurance as well. I was confused about the legality of this so I went on google and found some other redditors in a similar situation and someone mentioned it's not allowed to make contributions to an HSA when the owner has other health insurances. Assuming this is correct, should I leave my parent's plan so that I can invest in this HSA which I can use down the line and eventually for retirement?

I know asking for legal advice is not allowed on this sub, which is why I am assuming that I can not be on both health insurance plans without the IRS getting angry. I am trying to find out what the best plan is for the long term. Health wise, I am decently healthy and go in for physicals once to twice a year.

I work as a nurse, and I make 61000 per year gross. I graduated college back in 2017 and started working in July of that year. 
I am looking for help trying to figure out a realistic budget for expenses that aren’t already set in stone. I have two student loan profiles. One is at $23,292.52 the other is at 39,980. The larger is a federal loan and has a mixed interest rate but is pretty low. Private loan interest is 5.99%.
Basic budget that is set 
Rent $1050
Renters insurance $22
No car payment
Car insurance $56
Utilities ~100
Tv/internet 60
Phone 66
Gym 55
Gas ~240   I drive because I’m a homecare nurse 
Oil change roughly every 2 months/22 per month
Entertainment 150 mostly gaming and occasional baseball game or movie
Student loan payments:
352.54 for private loan 
74 for federal loan in income based repayment (I worked half a year during this registration period)
Food is probably my worst category as I’ve spent about $900 on average over the last few months ( I eat out a lot because of being on the road) for 2 people (my fiancé is very small and doesn’t eat much, I am overweight and eat too much.
From expenses I can track I’m at about 3200 per month spending. Plus some misc
I make 1740 after withholdings biweekly, with a reimbursement for mileage which usually totals to about 200-250 for a month, I have about 1500 in a 403b
My one credit card has a balance of 875.40 due to some medical bills I had to pay. But there was a 0 balance previously and I will pay it to 0 when I’m payed. 
I have two checking accounts one with $540 and one with $100 and I have about $96 worth of stocks in a robinhood account.

I have a meeting with my executive director and manager Monday.  Usually this type of comment on Reddit is followed by panic and terror, I however would be shocked if something bad were to happen, not saying it's not but I feel that I am an exlempory employee for the company the last 9 years.

I actually think they are going to offer me to be a Senior Network Engineer vs just a Network Engineer.  The funny thing is that it's basically the exact same thing that I have need doing for the last 3 years really just different job title.

So when I got started I had no experience and took the job way, under the going rate for this title in the state I am in.  I look it as getting paid for college and I have learned a crap ton.  I am very appreciative of their patience with me and am leading projects on my own a lot of times now.

So the problem is two fold:

1) let's say they offer me 20k which in my instance is basically 33% more than I make now, it is still massively under what a senior position would make at other companies.  I do know that my company doesn't really offer more than a percentage of what I make as a raise.  At the same time I like the company and don't feel like dog shit going to work everyday.  Also things like I live five minutes away and other perks like that  come into play for being happy with work life balance.

2) my wife and I Love where we live but due to the geography of the state it causes her to have massive migraines among other conditions.  We have talked about moving in two or three years to another state that would not present the same issues that she has here.

I guess my questions are should I feel obligated to tell them of our plans with the knowledge that I don't have to be in the office to do my job and can telecommute, but may be moving out of state?

Also do I bring up this desparity in pay for title when I know there is nothing either of them can do about it really?

Either way i know if I wanted pay closer to what my title was worth, I would have to move on to another company which I was begrudgingly going to start that search in 8 or 9 months because 3 years with just cost of living raises is not cutting the bills anymore with my wife's medical problems.

I am 36 and have an autoimmune condition which is disabling.  It affects my nervous system, so it comes with a side of anxiousness at times.  My long-term girlfriend covers our expenses, but I've been sitting on my savings and wasting its potential for too long.  She keeps telling me I should invest, and I've known for a while that I could do better - I am just overwhelmed at the investment options and don't relish paying fees unless it gets me more in the end (I suppose that's probably true for everyone with limited means).

I applied years ago for Social Security Disability, but the system is majorly broken so I am still in the process of appealing and due to my age may still get denied (they can discriminate based on age).  I wouldn’t get nearly as much money on a monthly basis as if I could work (have been attempting experimental medical treatments in hopes of improvement, as I hope to be a functional member of society again someday), however I am including this scenario in case I persevere in my case AND remain disabled.  I expect receiving somewhere from $600-1200 a month would make a difference in the recommendations I'd be given for the future.

I’ve added to my cash savings by selling many things that I had accumulated over the years and don't really have a use for anymore (musical instruments, rare tech collectibles, etc.) and between that and my former savings, I have almost 60k that should be working for me instead of sitting around in bank accounts.  I’ve looked at investing but am overwhelmed by the number of choices and whether some providers are more reputable than others.

I’ve been told Vanguard’s Admiral Fund is good and reliable with annual yields that are good over the past 10 years.  Though, I don't know the best way to acquire mutual funds nor if there's a better option for me to choose.  I’ve also seen advertisements for Wealthfront 2.75% APY accounts, which would be better than what I have now and leave the money accessible.  I've considered whether I should do some of both, but not sure how much.

So my question is this - with someone with limited to no income and cash on hand, how would you suggest investing?  Would it be best to split the money between an account such as the Wealthfront and put some into mutual fund(s)?  Should I consider stocks with the amount I currently have available?

I figure I'll get some questions as to my situation, so I'll try to put a few more details here with hopes I'll answer most.  I've been with my girlfriend for almost two decades, so I'm not super worried about an emergency where I'll need the cash.  She has an emergency fund, which she is also growing, and a good job.  We have two cars (rural midwest) and mine is paid off.  If any other specifics would help, please ask.

Would it be best to split the money between an account such as the Wealthfront and put some into mutual fund(s)?  Should I consider stocks with the amount I currently have available?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figure I&amp;#39;ll get some questions as to my situation, so I&amp;#39;ll try to put a few more details here with hopes I&amp;#39;ll answer most.  I&amp;#39;ve been with my girlfriend for almost two decades, so I&amp;#39;m not super worried about an emergency where I&amp;#39;ll need the cash.  She has an emergency fund, which she is also growing, and a good job.  We have two cars (rural midwest) and mine is paid off.  If any other specifics would help, please ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for any advice you may have and I look forward to the opportunity to better my situation as much as I can!&lt;/p&gt;

I've recently ran into a pickle, and really need some advice. I hope this isn't taken down for Rule 5/7 as it deals with being paid under the table, as I know no where else to ask since it's mainly focused on the financial aspect.  If it does not belong here please point me to a proper subreddit to ask.

I will warn you this will be a long one. I'll leave a TL:DR down at the bottom.  I'm around 20 and live in Ohio, and still financially supported by my family. I live with my mother, eat dinner at home, and don't really have any major monthly cost other than gas, (insuarances/phone is covered by family, I know it *real mature* of me).  I am also planning on doing a work-study when I get back to college to bring in \~$200-300 a month. In general, I am a very light spender, spending maybe $60-150 a month, if even that. My main goal for summer working was to earn some money for fun at college next semester. I also have around $1600 in my bank So I am relatively financially stable.

So let's talk about my *""Job""* and boss. I recently started working at a college fund produce stand. I knew nothing about it when I applied other than to just give a call to apply. It's ended up being a little shady. My Boss, we'll call Bob for the sake of anonymousness, runs the stand and can be a little aggressively, such as calling someone 3 times angrily for them not being able to work on some weekends because he has baseball games for his college in the middle of the day. He also yelled at a girl for not giving him enough notice of for missing a day of work, as she had a funeral of her great grandfather( she gave a 2 day warning).

The whole ""job"" is under the table, I found out about 3 days ago when I never had to fill out a W2 and got paid in cash. We make tips from people, between usually $10 if working with 2-3 other people and up to $40 if we're working alone. We make $7 an hour if we work at town #1 and $8 an hour at town #2. He also gives a 5% of the total profits at the end of the month, which is very vague as he did not explain how it's divided, whether it's 5% for each employee, or 5% divided between employees. There is also town #3 where we restock produce. I've worked every day usually around 11 hours a day, not counting driving time to and from work.

My normal workday is me leaving my house at 6:40AM to drive from town #1 to town #3, arriving at 7AM, I then load produce into my vehicle till about 7:30AM. I then drive back to town #1 to unload produce for one of our stands at town #1, which is about a 15 minute drive.  Then we drive up to town #2 as Bob has the rest of the produce needed in his vehicle, which is about a 20 minute drive. This means I spend around 70 minutes driving everyday for $10 bonus at $8 an hour.  We get a $10 a day as comp for driving. I then run a stall standing in the hot sun with no lunch break(we are allowed to snack on things that do not contain sugar while we have no customers). We are also not allowed to sit down at all, meaning I am on my feet everyday of the week for $7/8 an hour for 9.5 hours.

I do not get compensation for overtime, even though I work around 70-77 hours a week, nor get paid extra for working on the 4th of July.

Bob has been very happy with my work ethic and effectiveness. He has offered me the option to now run a stand in town #1. I would still work 11 hours a days, maybe longer, and would not even be able to think about taking off a day unless it was an emergency, but instead I would get 50% of the profits we earn everyday from that stand and my tips, but I think I would not earn an hourly wage. He said last year that averaged around the person earning around $100-200 before tips.

I am planning to ask on Monday for weekends off, even though it's our busiest days. I may ask for other benefits as well, and I am also considering on waiting till my next payday and quitting, which is in about a week and 2 days, as I can feel my body taking a toll as I come home and fall asleep within an hour and a half of being home, and have been feeling sunburned.

If I do get the extra money, I was planning on saving most of it for college spending, and giving the 1-2K to my guy who manages the 5-6K worth of assets. What do you think? I am really split what to do. Should I try to get legal support possibly?

# TL:DR College kid considering on taking 50% profits by solo running a stand, or quitting the job because it is under the table, no days off, grumpy boss, has no overtime pay, no holiday pay, and is below minimum wage, but offers tips, and 5% of total profits at the end of the month.

I&amp;#39;m also planning for my rent budget to be $2000 or under each month.  I also estimate my food spending to be about $300 a month maybe, not sure how realistic that would be.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there&amp;#39;s two things that I really want to get once I move to the US, and that&amp;#39;s a cat and a car.  Right now I&amp;#39;m thinking of getting an electric vehicle like a Tesla etc, because they seem like they can last me awhile to use.  Took a quick look at the Tesla sites, and some of their financing options seem to be around $500-$1100.  I&amp;#39;m not sure how much to estimate for car insurance given I&amp;#39;d be fairly young at 23.  So I&amp;#39;m wondering that if I do get a car, should I just put the minimum down payment and then use their financing, or pay more upfront?  Or would getting a car be an unwise decision completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

If this is the wrong sub I'll be happy to move it to the proper one.

&amp;#x200B;

My current role is the following (small services provider):

&amp;#x200B;

* Base Salary: $94,000/yr
* Healthcare (Dental and Medical) Stipend: $4600/yr (cash)
* Fully work from home position
* 1 week vacation
* No bonuses
* Some stock options (worth almost nothing)
* No 401k
* 52ish hour weeks, ""always on"" kinda thing, lots of slow and then rush to get it done situations.

&amp;#x200B;

We (Wife and I) pay $300/mo for health insurance, with limited coverage.

&amp;#x200B;

Wife has a 15 min commute and is earning around $22/hr.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to figure out whether it'd make sense financially for me to take a position that looks like the following (small well known company since  2001):

&amp;#x200B;

* Base Salary: $130,000
* Healthcare: $0 Deductible, fully covered (spouse included)
* Dental
* 401k matching (not sure of the %)
* On-site gym
* Unlimited (""reasonable"") vacation
* Parental leave
* 28 mile commute each way, around 50 min morning rush and probably 1h30m evening rush.
* Flexible schedule (arrive early leave early or arrive later leave later)to avoid rush hour.

I think that the fully remote position brings at least $12k \~ 18k in value in car related expenses (our gasoline bill is around $200/mo) plus being able to have lunch at home and the flexibility of taking breaks for errands mid day to get stuff done that would otherwise need permission from my team lead on the new role.

&amp;#x200B;

Would you take it?, what's you opinion? both companies are 10 \~ 50 employees my current role seems a bit stagnated TBH and I've started to dislike (ran out of patience) working with a specific coworker (nothing extreme but every time I have to do something with him I get in a bad mood), there might be room for growth in the  future but it's such a small flat department that I'm not sure if it'd be worth staying or if it's a better decision to look for roles similar to the second one, I'm at least 25 miles from any high paying jobs in the area.

&amp;#x200B;

Also not sure if the extra 750 hrs/yr spent in traffic are worth the salary increase, with my current base salary it turns out to be $47/hr, that times 750 is $35,250 which is roughly proportionate to the difference.

&amp;#x200B;

If we relocate near the new job (20 min away), then my wife's commute would become a  30 \~ 50 min each way and our housing cost would increase probably by a $500 \~ 1000 extra per month based on a quick search in an area.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever been in a similar position?, how did you approach it?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am curious to get some thoughts on whether a higher expense ratio is worth it if a fund has high returns (after all expenses) and is beating the S&amp;P 500. I am looking to invest for the long term. One of the funds I am considering that is beating the S&amp;P 500 is [FKASX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/314172636). It's expense ratio is \~1.4%. The other 2 funds I'm considering are below a .5%. According to the quarterly returns box (and assuming continuing performance in the future), FKASX has about a 12% return after all taxes and fees. I presume that includes the pricier expense ratio. I have 2 questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is expense ratio a percentage of your contributions, earnings, or both? Hypothetically, If I invested $100 in a year, then lost it all in 1 fund with a 1.4% expense ratio, even tho i earned 0 dollars, would I be charged $1.40?
2. Any further thoughts on all of this? Also a note, the load fee is waiver at fidelity, so it is relevant for this fund.

Backstory: 

My wife and I (both 28) moved to the US (Nevada) 3 month ago. 

I do a freelance job (\~45-75k\\year) 

She currently does 10$\\h caretaker job, while trying to pursue career of a make-up artist.

Assets: 2004 toyota paid upfront, 20k+ in cash (between BoA checking account and physical cash)

None invested, but no debt either.   
 we share checking account, and each have BoA credit card w\\500 limit that is barely used. 

Risk tolerance – I say low to medium.   
Questions: what would you suggest to do in terms of mid-term\\long term (retirement) investment?   
\- Vanguard, 401(k) – don’t understand too well how these things work, what should I watch or read to get some fundamental knowledge?

For background, I grew up low income but managed to fund university without debt for 2 years with family assistance.  While I was attending, my mother had me apply for a CC with her as a co-signer in order to build up credit. Her work slowed down and unfortunately after my second year I had to decide to take on a student loan or withdraw.  I withdrew (2009) due to hating the idea of debt, cut up my credit card, and last year worked my way in a new industry and am now earning ~110,000.00/year with it continuing to accelerate.   I was hoping to only work in this industry for another 6 months despite the pay as I was forced to move to Toronto to take a promotion.  I feel I need the friends and relationships I’ve had at home, and honestly don’t need to earn this much money to be happy.  I planned to start a business back home as honestly I believe it is the only way to become wealthy, which brings us to the subject.

My mother kept the co-signed credit line open and continued to use her card.  I discovered this in 2015 when I applied for a CC for work and it wasn’t approved unless it was a secured card which shocked me.  I confronted my mother but it was more due to her innocent ignorance in realizing that simply paying off the CC after missing payments doesn’t undo the damage on my credit report.  She paid it off, and closed the account, but it is now 2019 and I will have these marks until 2021-2022 which I fear will affect my ability to get government grants/business loan to start a business despite my own funds.  I will likely have 40,000.00 – 50,000 saved by end of November this year.  I am not opposed to working another year and continuing to save aggressively but I would REALLY like to have my friends close again.  They are “my life,” not this job.

To break down my credit report, everything has always been kept at near zero balance and it is spotless for missed payments other than the single joint credit card referenced in the title.
-I financed and paid off an auto loan with no missed payments (2013 – 2018)
-Currently began financing a motorcycle but will pay it off in full this year when ready to move back
-TD $500.00 limit Visa opened May 2016  -  (initially secured as mentioend, upgraded to unsecured and am keeping open to increase my Avg age of accounts)
-TD 10,500 limit opened Feb 2017 – Keeping open for AAOA
-MBNA 12,000 Limit opened April 2018 (unused now, I 0% financed a medical procedure with a promo)
-Amex 5,900 limit opened Dec 2017 (keeping open for AAOA)
-Amex CHARGE card opened March 2019 – Likely will close after using all the flight points (to visit home)
-Finally an RBC joint credit card with a 30 – 60 days late in Sept 2014, and a 60 – 90 late in March 2015

My question is whether or not there is any hope of solving the 3 missed payments on my report from 2015?  The irony of this is that if RBC had just approved me without a co-signer I would have had a perfect credit history.  What are my options here as I know these are bringing my credit score down from &gt;850 to around 680 with Equifax.  I have already tried speaking with the branch manager but they essentially tell me they tried escalating it but there is nothing they can do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi PersonalFinance,&lt;/p&gt;

Rent — $730

Food — $360

Going out/Dates — $150

Insurance — $135 (25/50/25 — used to be 10/20/10 but that’s playing with Fire)

Gas — $120

Smile Direct — $80

Phone (w/ $25 lease) — $70 (AT&amp;T, me and dad combined pay $130)

Misc. (tp, paper towels, small items etc.) — $50

Cat (emotional support animal) — $25

Apple Music — $5

** Total $1,775**
Left over $325

**Income $2100** ($18/h ~35/h week) ($18x35 hours * 0.17 in taxes)

I live in a 5 bedroom 3 bath and all tenants pay $730 (student housing). 

Currently -$600 on my CC so I’ll be using my next paycheck to pay them off. Just consider me at $0 right now. Rent for August has been paid already, so rent isn’t due until September. I get paid again the 12th, 26th &amp; 9th so assume I have ~$3500 in income coming in with 2x of every payment due besides rent. 

I try to budget myself to $12 in food a day for 30 days. I shop exclusively at Aldi but have an expensive taste (chicken breast, fruit, almond milk, fish, snacks for work etc.). Groceries usually last my 2 weeks and cost $70-$80 but don’t cover 3-4 meals a day. The rest of the money goes to either breakfast or lunch out. But I always try and spend less than $10 a day eating out and will make dinner at home. 

Going out/Dates is maybe a $10 AYCD twice a month, or maybe $18 on a bottle twice a month, maybe an actual date with a chick where I have to cover myself (~$15 after tip). Couple $3 wine bottles a week. Maybe some gas for the beach. Ya know, regular college things. 

Everything else is pretty static though. I know it seems like I’m answering my own question with this post, but maybe I’m missing spots I can save money on. 

Thanks for the help. I’ve been considering going to a food bank for food because I had been living off loans for a point in time before I got this internship and I don’t really know my future for employment. 

I know that I’m in a great position, and there are a lot of people far worse off, but I still want to be as efficient as I can be with my finances. I really hope I don’t offend anyone with this post.

I went on credit karma and looked at my credit report and saw that as of right now there are 4 accounts open in my name:

I also know that the electricity bill is under my name, but I'm not sure how that affects me.

I’m single, work full time and don’t have any big expenses. I have enough money at the end of month to save and my employer pays for my car( lease, gas, taxes, insurance) 

I recently inherited some money and have about 375k € in a savings account. I currently live with a friend but I’m looking to buy an apartment, costing about 350k €. In my European country there is usually about a 5 month period between the agreement of purchase and the actual payment. This means that if i find the apartment of my dreams tomorrow, I’d still have 5 months were the money sits idly on my savings account. 

I had a call with my banker because I hate seeing that amount of money on a savings account when the interest rate is lower than inflation. 

He tried to convince me that it would be smart to invest a portion for 20 years ( lets say 100k €) and keep the rest on the savings account. When it would be time to pay for the apartment I would use my savings and supplement with a mortgage with a fixed rate. Since an investment on 20 years would have a higher return than the cost of my mortgage I would be making money. 
It would also be smarter as it would diversify my money.

My thought is that it will be best to keep all expenses on my cc, due to the ability to receive rewards etc. for the spending. I will also avoid having to open a new account.

My favorite hockey team is taking a road trip to California for about a week and it seems like a good excuse to travel somewhere new, by myself, for the first time. I could use some advice on unexpected travel expenses and whatnot. First, my plan:

Fly into San Jose on 11/22, pick up the rental car from the airport, enjoy the city, and spend the night at an AirBNB. On 11/23 I'm going to go to the Islanders @ Sharks game and explore the city some more. On 11/24 I will be checking out of my San Jose AirBNB and drive down to Anaheim, check into my Anaheim AirBNB and explore the city. On 11/25 I will go to the Islanders @ Ducks game and meet a friend that I've known for a while who is going to show me around. On 11/26 I'll do whatever I feel like I suppose. On 11/27 I'm going to go to the Islanders @ Kings game and do whatever in LA. On 11/28 I'll check out of my AirBNB in Anaheim, drive to the airport and leave.

So I made a spreadsheet that the automod removed so let me try to replicate the results of that here:

1. Flights $348  
2. Food $240  
3. Lodging $220  
4. Rental car ~$450  
5. Game tickets $200  
6. Gas $60

Some notes:
The flight prices are as of today, they can change per day depending on how long I wait to book. I used Skyscanner to find flights.
I found some awesome AirBNB places and chose to go with the best deals in a good location for me. I only went with reputable superhosts that have good reviews.
The food estimates are much higher than what I would actually spend because I eat very little, and what I do eat is usually fairly cheap, but I may splurge on a day or two for a good meal out at a restaurant.
The rental car is through a company called Sixt, which quoted me about $450 after fees and under 25 fee for a Hyundai Elantra or similar, with insurance + extra liability insurance. I would normally just use an uber to get places, but I figured that the freedom of going wherever and doing whatever without stressing over Uber prices during rush hours is worth it.
The gameday tickets are through StubHub which I've used without problems for Isles games in the past, the final game against Los Angeles is better seat than the other two because I figured why not.
My grand total appears to be about $1,500 before any kind of extra spending money is taken into account. Before I get into this mess, would you say that my itinerary is somewhat accurate based on expected costs? Am I missing something that I've failed to take into account?

A lein will be put on our house and it will be financed through the water utility by default at 2% until we start making payments, then it increases to 4%.

We will also need to connect within 12 months of completion of the project. Costs are $8k to decommission our septic tank and run a pipe 150 feet from the house to the road. We will also need to pay a $5,800 hookup permit to the sewer department.

So we are looking at about $38k to connect.

Let me just preface this by saying I have made SEVERAL idiotic decisions that have led me to where I am and I take full responsibility for them. Whatever I need to hear, harsh or kind, please let me have it. 

This will be a long post as I have zero idea what to do and just want to lay out where my head is at.
Also forgive me for I'm posting on mobile and the formatting will look messy. 

I have the following debts - 

CC1 - 5k unpaid 
CC2 - 850 unpaid 
Personal Loan - $7.1k unpaid
PayPal Credit - $410 unpaid 

I got here because I was going through a bout of depression last fall / winter...shit, all of last year...and my head was not on straight. I took out some loans to buy career related things. I also was schemed out of some money by a friend in a story I am way too embarrassed to share. Long story short, here I am. 

I pay $400 a month in order to help my mother out with some bills. I'd like to contribute more.

I quit my job on June 3rd for a very silly reason; I was the best ""customer service"" accountant person in an office full of people where English was their second language. A lot of speaking duties were put on to me and I quit in a fit of rage after feeling taken advantage of (I just got my degree in accounting and in 6 months of me being there, I did more collection calls, training other employees, admin work, and handling speaking duties than beginning to advance my career). It was also 9-6 with a 1:15-2 hour commute one way. This was dumb but I can honestly say I was MISERABLE!!!!

I'm fortunate to have a car in which I just pay the registration for and repairs. 

I know how to cook for my preferences and my workouts so I can save my self a lot of money in this department as well. 

I start a new position on Monday paying 18/hr. I'm excited because it will be actual accounting work and if they hire me, I'm going to try to negotiate a higher pay rate. I'm worried because it is a temp job and if they don't think I'm a good fit, it is back to square one. I've been hitting the courses hard and staying in the gym to be mentally prepared for the role to make sure this doesn't happen. 

Why am I considering bankruptcy? 
- In September I won't be covered under my mother's health insurance anymore and I definitely don't want to go without health insurance. This will cost me &amp; add another debt. 



- I want to get my CPA liscense which will require extensive studying which I am willing and able to do. Only thing is, I have these debts. Do I get a second job and pay off these debts as soon as possible? Or do I study, pay minimal amounts, and bank on my salary increasing once I get the license? (Which can take a minimum of 2 years with me going back to school &amp; what not) 

- my credit score sits at 700 as of now which is one thing I've done right....and I'm not sure if it's worth ruining. 

-My savings dried up and I need to build a new one ASAP! But the debts looming over my head affect my thought processes and I don't know whether to pay those or save sumn. 

- The silliest reason.. I've finally built the social life I've wanted for years and don't want to skip out on events and become the miserable, depressed person I was last year. Trust me when I say I do NOT want to go back.

So things I learned from this sub that seems to have helped... keep an eye out on who touches your CC, Fast food places should not take your card out of view, don’t panic if fraud happens on your card, use CC vs bank card as it is not your money that is being stolen, and monitor closely charges on your account!

I have recently been accepted to a German Hochschule to study Software Technology and given my current financial situation, I was wondering if there are any pointers you guys could throw my way. For the sake of simplicity I will just list out relevant information:

* 23 year old American

* The program is 1.5 years, from October 2019 through March 2021

* The program will cost ~$1,900 USD per semester for 3 semesters, a fraction of what it would cost in the US

* I will not be paying rent, at least not until I become ready to move out, and will be staying with good people that I know already

* I intend to work as soon as possible as much as possible (B1 German speaker, good field of study). Hoping for at least a 20-30 hrs/week earning a few hundred Euros per month with the hopes of getting my own place by the end of my studies

* I expect to have around 9,000 USD (8,000 Euros) in September which is when I plan to leave

* Recent US college graduate, current loans(~$85k) will go into deferment

* I have studied abroad in the UK before and have also been to the city I am studying before twice so I shouldn't have any surprises in this arena

* My expected monthly expenses will be food, phone plan, and insurance which I expect will cost ~350 Euro/month (spit balling) and transportation will be 200 Euro/semester

* I will have financial help if I absolutely need it, but that is obviously the last thing I want to have to do  
  
  

I believe that this is doable and at least somewhat responsible as long as I find work, which I have been assured by people in the city that I will be able to find with effort along with my current German speaking level and popular field of study. 

Obviously there are other factors like will I visit home and how often, can I find work within a decent time frame, etc.  
  
  

***QUESTIONS:***  
Does this seem like a foolish choice financially? I do expect my earning potential to multiply with this degree. I think of this as an investment in myself and I like the way it looks for my future.

Do you have any insight on how I can best prepare myself financially in the coming months or once I arrive in Germany?

Would a travel rewards credit card be worth trying?

Do you know of any resources that would be useful for my situation?

Anything else you can think of!

I know that you won't *truly* know how much things will cost until you get there, so I have tried to overestimate (for example right now I have groceries down as about $40 more than what I spend now and I've gone with the highest insurance quotes etc) But I'm honestly feeling like I'm going crazy trying to figure this whole thing out.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to work for one of the big 4 accounting firms at $53k/yr in FL (not Miami) for reference. I really want to live alone because most of my school friends are from town and aren't going to move out for probably another year and I don't want to live with random people as that hasn't gone well for me in college (I've always had problems with how sloppy and messy other people are so I've just accepted I must be the problem and should live alone). However when considering the future 12+ hour days 6-7 days a week I feel like I need a washer/dryer, no roommate, location with good access to the interstate just all for convenience and peace of mind, but rent will end up being a bit over 1/3 and I keep seeing people saying you should aim for 1/4 but I honestly can't find anything that seems well kept, safe, and convenient for those prices.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have no debt, I've been blessed to have good scholarships and a family member who reimbursed tuition if we passed so I have actually ""made"" money off of college, as well as being gifted a 2013 Honda CRV when I was 16 from teh grandparents which I hope will continue to last me for a long time. Here's what I currently have:

&amp;#x200B;

Fidelity Investments- \~$19,000

&amp;#x200B;

Fidelity Roth IRA- \~$6,000 (I submit whatever the maximum I'm allowed to per year but I didn't work FT in school so it isn't always a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

Fidelity Savings- \~$8,000 (just because it gets better interest than my credit union savings)

&amp;#x200B;

Credit Union Savings- $8,000 (planning on keeping it here just for all the moving expenses and logistics as it's easier to get this to checking)

&amp;#x200B;

and a couple hundred in checking.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now it seems my monthly income will be $4,416, after subtracting my 401k up to the match, the average insurance cost ($360) and dental ($50) I found on our provider's website as well as parking is supposedly pretax and taxes/FICA I will have $3,042 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

My top 3 places range from $950-1160 per month base rent without water/electric/utilities so I've just rounded rent to $1,200

&amp;#x200B;

Water estimated $30

&amp;#x200B;

Electric estimated $100

&amp;#x200B;

Gas estimated $60 w/ toll guru

&amp;#x200B;

Car Insurance is currently $947/12 mo on my parents policy so 79 a month

&amp;#x200B;

Groceries estimated $200

&amp;#x200B;

Renters Insurance estimated $30

&amp;#x200B;

Which leaves $1,403 left which doesn't include if you want to go out or keep up Spotify (my parents said they won't kick me off of Netflix/Hulu or make me give up my Sam's club card and things like that where the cost is the same for them anyway). My dad has agreed to pay my phone bill until the contract is up in 4/2020

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'm trying to overestimate and all but it seems kind of impossible to balance everything, but I really don't want to give up quality of life since I'm a homebody. I do think groceries will be definitely overestimated during busy season as they order in lunch and dinner almost every day but I don't know what to do

EDITED because the car insurance my mom had told me was 12 months not 6, my mistake, updated the numbers","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey y&amp;#39;all, I know that there&amp;#39;s help in the wiki and my parents have also helped me with some of the budgeting I&amp;#39;ve done so far. I know that you won&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; know how much things will cost until you get there, so I have tried to overestimate (for example right now I have groceries down as about $40 more than what I spend now and I&amp;#39;ve gone with the highest insurance quotes etc) But I&amp;#39;m honestly feeling like I&amp;#39;m going crazy trying to figure this whole thing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to work for one of the big 4 accounting firms at $53k/yr in FL (not Miami) for reference. I really want to live alone because most of my school friends are from town and aren&amp;#39;t going to move out for probably another year and I don&amp;#39;t want to live with random people as that hasn&amp;#39;t gone well for me in college (I&amp;#39;ve always had problems with how sloppy and messy other people are so I&amp;#39;ve just accepted I must be the problem and should live alone). However when considering the future 12+ hour days 6-7 days a week I feel like I need a washer/dryer, no roommate, location with good access to the interstate just all for convenience and peace of mind, but rent will end up being a bit over 1/3 and I keep seeing people saying you should aim for 1/4 but I honestly can&amp;#39;t find anything that seems well kept, safe, and convenient for those prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently have no debt, I&amp;#39;ve been blessed to have good scholarships and a family member who reimbursed tuition if we passed so I have actually &amp;quot;made&amp;quot; money off of college, as well as being gifted a 2013 Honda CRV when I was 16 from teh grandparents which I hope will continue to last me for a long time. Here&amp;#39;s what I currently have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity Investments- ~$19,000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity Roth IRA- ~$6,000 (I submit whatever the maximum I&amp;#39;m allowed to per year but I didn&amp;#39;t work FT in school so it isn&amp;#39;t always a lot)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fidelity Savings- ~$8,000 (just because it gets better interest than my credit union savings)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Union Savings- $8,000 (planning on keeping it here just for all the moving expenses and logistics as it&amp;#39;s easier to get this to checking)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and a couple hundred in checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now it seems my monthly income will be $4,416, after subtracting my 401k up to the match, the average insurance cost ($360) and dental ($50) I found on our provider&amp;#39;s website as well as parking is supposedly pretax and taxes/FICA I will have $3,042 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My top 3 places range from $950-1160 per month base rent without water/electric/utilities so I&amp;#39;ve just rounded rent to $1,200&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water estimated $30&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electric estimated $100&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas estimated $60 w/ toll guru&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car Insurance is currently $947/12 mo on my parents policy so 79 a month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groceries estimated $200&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm due to receive an inherited IRA, however I have some questions related to the process.

&amp;#x200B;

1: Is the financial institution required to show me the transactions that occurred on the account prior to my actual receiving of the funds that are in it? I'm mainly interested in the transactions that occurred after the deceased's passing and my possession of the funds, just to ensure that nothing shady was done since the passing and my acquisition.

&amp;#x200B;

2: How long does this process normally take, after initially signing the forms to open the account at the same institution? I'm worried that the FA handling this is delaying things. It's been about 3-4 weeks since initially contacting them.

&amp;#x200B;

3: Am I required to use/pay for a financial advisors service's at this firm for just having an inherited IRA account with this institution? More importantly, can I have an account open there, and prevent the advisor from manipulating the account without my consent? It's mostly stocks, and I don't want them making trades(which gets them commission) without my permission, on the basis of ""managing"" my portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

4. If I was to decide that I wanted to transfer my inherited IRA to a different institution, what steps can I take to prevent an unscrupulous FA from hindering or delaying a transfer, and how long and to what extent can one block or delay that transfer?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit, 5: One last question - I've actually inherited two IRAs, one of which is a Roth IRA. From what I've researched, a Roth IRA must be held for 5 years by the decedent before a beneficiary can withdraw tax free. The beneficiary I had inherited from(about a year ago)  had inherited the Roth IRA from someone who had passed about 2 years ago, who had the account open for well over 5 years. Will distributions withdrawn from this Roth IRA count as taxable income because the person I inherited from held it for less than 5 years? Or will it be eligible due to the chain of inheritance which was held for longer than 5 years?

I appreciate all input.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

Long story short my past couple years have been a lot of bad financial decisions on my part.  I have a pretty steady job which pays me approximately $1,800 a month.

I called the local community outreach and there are no money or housing services at this time in my town.

I have been offered admission into Iowa State University, and I'm grateful for the opportunity. I'm not able to afford college, so after almost a year of research, I've decided to enlist in the Air National Guard and have also filled out the FAFSA. To explain more - the Air National Guard (ANG) pays 100% of college tuition (not including fees) in Iowa State (and some other states as well). The requirements are minimal - things such as a 6 year enlistment contract, GPA above a specific number, etc. All fine by me. 

My problem is that after I've filled out FAFSA, my 'Total Financial Need' is $37,844 - that's the same as my estimated cost of attendance. Yet it's estimated that I'll be receiving a Pell Grant of $3097 per year. This number is from a revised document - on January (originally) it was an estimated $6195. 

My question is: How come my aid was reduced? Is this a normal number for a student showing real financial need? (When filling FAFSA, I wrote that my Expected Family Contribution is $0 - because that's really how much they can help me with.)  

I'm sorry this post is all over the place - I'm a little confused. I'm going to be calling ISU's Financial Aid department when their office opens, but for now I'd really appreciate some advice into my situation.

I have the purchases of the tickets on my credit card, completely a different price from my friends bank statement. I'm not sure if the airline only charged a certain amount onto my friend, but it doesn't make sense how these numbers work out.

They did not give any receipts or proof of the purchase outside of our tickets, which we threw away at this point. The tickets did not display the price if I recall correctly. My friend called the airline and they said that they couldn't do anything since we bought the tickets at the airport through an agent there instead of from the airline directly. We also don't have much proof of everything since we weren't given any receipts, and the descriptions on our bankers statements are unhelpful (i.e. ""Airline name - Travel).

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read through this, and any advice you have.

I didn't learn how to be responsible with money when I started making it. I spent my paychecks as a teen on gas, food, and stupid things I didn't need with no one to keep me in check. Also, I live in a rural area with no businesses within walking/biking distance and on a lot of hills. A car is a necessity where I live.

I worked fast food part-time for a few months as my first job. Only a small amount of credit card debt as on my mom's advice I opened an account to start building credit history. Long story short, the heat of the kitchen led to emergency room visits which led to finding out I have a heart condition. I had to leave the job for that reason, and decided to start college after I found a job working at a local shop.

Half a semester into college riding 100% on student loans as I only made about $80/week, I wrecked my car by hitting a dead animal at night. I lost traction and slid into a ditch. Liability insurance, so I was broke with no transport. This was the day after my birthday, so my brother stayed in town with me and my family for several weeks, taking me to and from school and work, and helping me figure out my car situation. A friend of his came through and allowed me to make payments on a cheap SUV they had.

That vehicle ended up costing a lot of money to keep running. Halfway through my second semester, I was too broke to get to school every day. I didn't have any gas or money and the SUV was leaking just about every fluid it could and running rough. After my grades dropped and my teachers could not help me, I applied for a hardship withdrawal. It was denied. I appealed and provided all of the evidence I could, but it was denied again. Therefore I still owed the full amount of the student loans. I picked up another job and started saving to replace the SUV. When I got the money together, I got another car and sold the SUV. The store I worked at closed, and I went back to the local shop I worked at before, back to $80/week. Around this time my dog got pneumonia and it cost over $1,000 to treat him.

A month into owning that vehicle and bring surprised with a suddenly failed crankshaft pulley and fuel pump, I was T-boned. The guy was speeding around a corner and pulled into the right-turn lane I was making a left through just in time to hit me so hard the car flipped over. No cameras, no proof of speed or where he was, only that I was making a left turn. All fault on me, no money to recover from insurance. Broke and carless.

A couple of months later, selling everything of value I could, saving every penny I could make, my brother comes through for me again. He gave me his old car just in time for me to land a good full-time job making a decent amount of money. I spent some of the money fixing the car up, as it had several minor mechanical issues. I spent another chunk of that being stupid becauze I felt like I deserved it. Then the car broke down and I ended up getting another credit card just to pay for the repairs. Fast forward 3 months of using most of my income to pay down debts, and they decide they didn't need me there anymore. I was devastated, but got right on to the job hunt and had a new job in 2 weeks. Only part time but with the intent to go full after training. Turns out I was only bridging a gap while they were short-staffed and working on cross-training to save money. I found email evidence of that but decided I'd try to work really hard and prove my worth. It didn't work and I lost that job.

 It took almost 2 months and hundreds of applications to get a new job. In the meantime I lived as frugally as possible, I hardly ever went out, but I still had to eat and get myself basic needs. I used my credit cards for that and my money on paying the credit card bill. I finally got a job, and it turned out to be a ""1099"" position, but they only did it that way to avoid paying taxes. Three weeks in, my car spins a crankshaft bearing and the engine was ruined. The repairs were too expensive, and the consensus was that I needed to sell and replace it. Well, I sold it. And despite having a ride to my job for every scheduled shift I had, my boss fired me because it created ""reliability issues"". 

So my income stopped suddenly and now I'm stuck without much money, a car, no way to get a loan, and debt drowning me. I don't have any friends or family that can/will put a loan in their name, or loan me money personally. I've sold almost every item of value I have. I spend every day looking for cars and trying to make something work. I want to be more responsible with my money and NEVER have to go through crap like this again. I'm miserable every day and feel hopeless. I'm done being stupid and spending it on junk. Lesson learned. I'm roughly $20K in debt between student loans, hospital bills, and credit cards.

TL;DR - I was dumb and also some bad things happened and now I'm broke, in debt, jobless and carless. I don't know what to do and I'm desperate.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about to turn 26 in the end of the month, and have been struggling with credit card debt for 2 years now, mostly helping family out, didn't expect interest to hit me this hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Last February I had to quit my high paying job due to health reasons, and ended up traveling around the US searching for a new place to call home, its been 4 months now, with money still in my savings account I moved in with my sister who is okay with me staying over, just to save more money.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't pay rent, I never order take out, with two warehouse jobs right now, and my credit score just went below 600.

&amp;#x200B;

I need advice in how to increase my credit score quickly, and if a personal loan is a good idea, I have until early September to go somewhere else, I can't stay here longer than 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Any response is appreciated, I should apologize in advance if i don't reply quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for the advice everybody,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm editing this post to remind some redditors that I made this post for advice, I needed to know what are the options, whats the best way to tackle my current situation. that's all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that poor choices were made, I didn't spend money on meaningless material things, family members were stuck in a situation that I believed at the time I should lend a helping hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not here to read that I should cut out my family, and that I'm stupid and irresponsible, I should learn how to spend money first. I should quit vices like smoking or drinking. (I don't drink or smoke)  

&amp;#x200B;

The road trip wasn't planned, after quitting my job, I had nowhere to be, I just got in my car and drove. 

&amp;#x200B;

For all of you in the same situation I wish you the best of luck, there is a lot of great advice shared in these comments.

I chose an out-of-state college because none of my state colleges had my intended major, linguistics. And, looking back on it, I was also following what my friends were doing and going to an out of state college. The state I went to for college is very far away and has a climate that I have now learned makes me depressed the majority of the time that I am there. Also while taking my linguistics classes there I began to realize that I did not really like linguistics that much (and, looking back, certainly not enough to warrant losing my in-state college scholarships). However, I learned that I am really passionate about teaching English as a foreign language and hope to do that after college for a couple years, save up some money, and use that to travel the world before I head back to the United States. 

The problem is that I am terrified that debt will hold me back from teaching English and traveling the world afterwards. I have finished my first year at the out-of-state college and despite having a really good scholarship am $6500 in debt because of a school and a major that I don't really like that much. I am considering transferring. The problem is, though, that if I rush the linguistics major next year it is possible for me to graduate with only 2 years in college. This is a feasible plan but the thought of going back to that school scares me. I would not go back if I had to stay for much longer. Also linguistics isn't the most marketable major and you don't even need a linguistics major to teach abroad.

My other choices are to go to one of my state colleges. My choices are a large state college that seems pretty good for my intended major (Global Studies) and costs more than the college I am transferring out of. I will probably be there for 2-3 more years. The other in state option is a smaller school that doesn't have as much opportunities for my intended major but is within driving distance from my parents' house and I would not have to pay for housing. Transferring also gives me to try out other fields that interest me like CS and Architecture.

I am very scared and anxious about this decision. It keeps me up all night and I know that making a decision and sticking to it will be best but I am the worst at making decisions. I can't even order off of menus without taking a long time.

So it seems I have a few options.

1) Switch to a no fee broker like Vanguard. However most of these seem to have $1000-$3000 minimums which may keep me from investing for the next year or so...
2) Stick with Ally and invest quarterly or every 6 months and in which case the 10% fee becomes more like a 2% fee.

I'm looking for some objective advice on a possible investment opportunity.

A small holiday house on a rental plot at a holiday park became available, I heard through a friend that also has a house there. It is not in the best location in regards to being connected, but it is a great place to retreat to and the park itself has some really nice up to date facilities.

Now it is a nice small and secluded house that does need a bit of maintenance, especially the kitchen, but is overall in a pretty good shape and comes fully furnished. The buying costs are 5000 everything included, even plot rent until the end of the year. After December plot rent will be 250 a month.

Now holiday houses at the park usually go for double that amount, so I could potentially buy it and sell it somewhere in the coming year. This attractive to me because, a. profit potential, and b. I have to leave my current apartment next summer and with this holiday house I could potentially leave early and half my monthly rent for a while, which would be nice as my current contract at work expires next January and there is no chance of an extension of the contract. It can also serve as a place to retreat while I do the writing necessary for my job.

My issues are these:

* I have never spent this much money on anything before and as such am horribly inexperienced and am worried I am not seeing the whole picture.
* I could pay this whole, but it would take a big chunk out of my savings (about 2/3s).
* I would pay approximately 100 a month in fees for extras (internet, gas, electricity, water) on top of my normal expenses, which is doable, but will cut into my savings potential.
* While there is potential for profit, there is no guarantee.
* I am a bit of a homebody and I am afraid I won't make enough use of the place to warrant the expense.

My employer match is as stated: *&lt;Company name&gt; contributes a match of 10% of dollars contributed to your personal cap for the year set by IRS guidelines with immediate vesting upon enrollment.* 

So if I contribute the max 19k for 2019, they will contribute $1900 if I'm reading that correctly. Most matches I've seen on this sub is a percentage of salary and so then the general rule of thumb is to invest up to the match and then put the rest into a Roth IRA up to 6k. 

Given this scenario though, how should I invest my money? I don't think I can reach the 401k cap for this year. Let's just say theoretically I have 15k to put in. Should I still put all 15k in my 401k to get $1500 or put some of that into a Roth IRA?

Again, I'm still fairly new to all of this so if there is any additional information I need to provide or I'm misinterpreting some stuff, feel free to let me know and correct me.

I don’t have anyone in my life who knows these things, and never had someone growing up to help teach me. 

Here’s the problem: when I had the mental break, I quit my job in part to stay home and raise a high-risk kiddo I had taken guardianship of (while I was very young).

When I did get a new job, I immediately set it up so that part of my paycheck went automatically into a savings. I’ve paid off a few thousand in two years, but I work in a non-profit and paying the total off is taking me longer than I had hoped. I feel dumb because I knew this is how credit debt goes and let it happen anyway. 

Now I have accumulated a couple thousand in savings, but am still several thousand more in credit debt. I would like to pursue my master’s degree, but feel uneasy doing so with so much debt. I also feel that because I am 25, letting go of the little I have in savings also feels irresponsible. 

I’d like to get a side hustle but it is crucial in my current work that I get down time, and unfortunately if I work more on the radar I will have to be paying off my student loans which I’m currently on an income driven payment plan for. 

The debt stress takes a massive toll.

Short term financial goal - save around £500,000 in 5-6 years to buy an apartment in London.

Current (non-retirement) savings - Around £120,000 (with about $50,000 in the Chase checking account) 

So here is our financial plan - 
1. Close the Chase account 

2. Have a high yield joint checking account for joint expenses and maintain $10,000 in buffer cash (we are considering Consumer Credit Union (CCU))

3.A personal “spending” checking account for each of us - (considering Charles Schwab (CS))

4. Move a chunk into an short-term investment account for 5-6 years until we need the money to buy 
the house.

5. Move the rest into an retirement account (need to research these more, IRAs seem to be the starting point)

6. We don’t plan to have an emergency fund for now outside of the $10,000 buffer cash because our expenses are such that one of our paychecks is enough to maintain our lifestyle. In the extreme scenario that we both lose our jobs at the same time, my dad would be able and happy to lend us the money easily.

FYI: I live in Raleigh NC","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been reading that mortgage rates are going down a lot recently. My wife and I got a 30 year home mortgage at 4.625% in January. They now look to be around 3.7% or so for a 30 year mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking about refinancing our mortgage, but to be honest I don&amp;#39;t really know how to go about it. Any recommendations on going about finding a lender, what are reasonable closing costs (should I haggle?), and the rest of it? I am also wondering if I should wait a bit to see if rates go down further? &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

\~5 years ago i bought small amount of stocks listed in TSX.V through one of the European banks, this was a mistake since i know nothing about markets or trading to this day (+ stock price dropped 50% :)

&amp;#x200B;

1. During that time that bank closed it's branch in my home country (also EU), and raised fees for non-residents of Estonia.
2. Bank no longer supports buying/selling stocks in TSX.V

Bank support says that the only way of selling is transferring stocks somewhere else, but where?? for example Interactive Brokers does not accept transfers for this stock.

I just do not see a way out of this.

I'm in my early thirties. I was a victim of the recession and bad job market when I graduated from college, and have been bouncing between part-time jobs ever since (usually working two or three, but right now I'm down to one). I have not been able to turn any of these part-time positions into full-time, much less a potential career path.

I have been stuck in my mother's house since my college graduation (I have a bachelor's in B.A.). She has been charging me rent (though she has not drawn up any official papers, just a notepad where she jots numbers down). In addition, she had to take out a Parent Plus loan for me to finish my college education as my father divorced her and moved to cut us all off, forcing her to take drastic measures just for me to finish. She has been insistent that I pay the Plus loan before I move out, and I have not been able to consistently pay my own student loans, much less the Plus one. Every time I have made enough money to try to get out of here, she slams the Plus loans down on me and keeps me trapped.

My car broke down around Thanksgiving 2017, and after a year of it sitting in the garage, as my mother and youngest brother (I have two brothers who also live in this house) have kept taking from my credit card and my car shop credit card to fix their own cars, I finally junked it. I have been forced to beg for rides to go to work, and one of the reasons why I finally left one of my positions is because I could no longer be reliably transported to said position. Before you ask why I didn't use Uber or Lyft, I didn't even have a cell phone until extremely recently as I couldn't afford a plan, and as it is I needed help from a long-distance friend just to open a plan.

I have not been able to accrue enough credit on my credit card to use it as a resource, as it is it is actually overdrawn.

Now here's the crux of the situation. My mother had severe medical issues around Christmas of last year, and it caused her to fall behind on her bills. She is blaming me for being unable to pay her enough rent to pay her bills and credit cards, even though I am giving her every cent I can spare (and sometimes more than that). I have been applying for additional positions but so far I have not been able to land one. She is not doing well emotionally or psychologically, and if I describe the current situation in detail to anyone I know, they feel that I am in an abusive environment with her as the abuser and I am the victim. To hear my mother tell it, she feels I am the abuser. I do not know what to think.

The IRS has decided my mother is not paying her taxes quickly enough and is moving to slap a lien on the house, possibly garnish her wages, and possibly could seize a vehicle. I am the only person in the house with a credit rating good enough to take out a personal loan, although it most likely will not be enough to cover the $6K+ the IRS wants. She has been trying to force me to take it out even though I am in no position to be able to pay that loan off. It will further entangle me in debt and even if it works, it is only a stopgap measure for one year. Plus, I will not be able to purchase a vehicle with a personal loan on my record.

I cannot withdraw from my 401K or take a loan from that account as there isn't enough in there to do so under my employer's policy (as well as Alight's policy), and as I have no documents in my name I can't claim financial hardship. So any chance of me using that, even just to buy a cheap car and drive out of this financial and psychological hell, is gone.

The house is falling apart, we lack several basic amenities and no AC. My mother will not let my brothers or I invite anyone over. It's made it impossible to form meaningful friendships, much less any romantic relationships. I have some long-distance friends, but they are in no position to bail me out of here, plus that is a lot to ask out of them. I have no one close enough to room with, and no way to obtain a vehicle to try to escape.

I feel like I have nowhere to go, and my relationship with her and my brothers is deteriorating as they are taking her side (the youngest is in the best position as my mother will not charge him rent due to him graduating with a master's degree, so he in particular has no reason to take my side). I have to make up my mind as to whether I should play ball or not, as the IRS will slap the lien down in the middle of next week.

What should I do?

Here we go:

I’m 24m, no debts, just moved to a different city and got a job making 39k/y. I have 9k saved for emergencies. 

My salary goes to:
- food 540$
- public transport (I don’t have a car) 180$
- phone 51$
- credit card (signatures I don’t want to cancel) 300$
- house bills 230$
- recreation: 600$

I don’t pay rent because I live with my mother in law, something I don’t want to do forever. 

My salary it is more than ok for me right now, last month I was able to save almost 1,5 and it made me feel pretty good. 

I want to do a MBA in my field so in the future I can be better at my job and of course, ask for a raise or get a new job at somewhere else. 

MBA 930$

The thing is: if I do I won’t be able to save any money. Maybe I’ll need to get about 100$ monthly from my savings. This is if I don’t do anything different with the rest of my salary, like the money I use to recreation, going out once a week and do something. I really don’t want to change that. 

It is for about 2 years and of course many things can happen in that time. Like, getting fired. Unpredictable things can happen. Our washing machine is having problems, pretty sure it will die soon.


Ask for a loan it is not a option. 

I tried to ask help for my company and they didn’t gave an answer yet. 

I know ending the month with 0 is better than be negative but I need to hear better from you since there are (small) risks involved.

&lt;p&gt;I tried to ask help for my company and they didn’t gave an answer yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know ending the month with 0 is better than be negative but I need to hear better from you since there are (small) risks involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

My dad works in a mechanic shop but all the money he makes go right back into rent and maintenance very rarely he brings $300-$1000 home. He can't sit around and not work so he just goes there. He was recently injured and has ongoing dental problems. Dental alone is costing thousands for a fix and his therapy on top of that. He has multiple bank accounts. SO many that he can't remember which one's he has open and he keeps on taking out loans for his shop.

My mom recently had an injury but she recovered and is working 12 hour shifts constantly just to keep us afloat. She's studying on top of that. Each course is costing her about $1000 or more. She finished 3 years and she has 1-2 years left.

I only worked during the latter half of 2018, and will be working most of 2019 at a much higher income. As a result, my income will rise from **$35k in 2018** to **$100k in 2019**. I live in CA, so my taxes will go from 21% (fed + state) to 33%.

I've claimed zero allowances and my new employer is currently withholding at last year's full rate (21%). This means that, come tax season, I'll owe a shit ton of cash to the government. :(

Some questions:

1.) I'm guessing .33-.21 = .12 x 100,000 = $12,000 likely owed. Is this the correct amount I should put aside?

2.) Is there any way to have more withheld, or do I just have to wait until next year?

**3.) My biggest concern: I'm not too familiar with tax penalties, but I get the impression that having more than a few grand owed means you're paying an extra fee on top of that. Will I get penalized for owing so much?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** I think I figured it out! I was judging my tax cut based on my last paycheck, which was the first time I had federal/state taxes withheld from this company (I started last month but the first few paychecks only had FICA taken out because I miss marked something on my W4 and had to get that fixed). I only worked 2 out of 5 days (I'm an hourly W2 employee) and so my income was 40% of what it is normally. That explains why my tax cut was so low—I was thinking that taxes were calculated based on projected annual income and not by paycheck. I feel like an idiot now.

I’m sure it’d be awesome to be old and retired with a huge lump sum to make me comfortable. I just fear looking back and regretting life because I had no experiences or adventures.

So is a truck and a boat plausible in my situation for next summer?

Income: 
After taxes, health insurance, and 6% to retirement, I take home $7,000/mo

Rent: $1,300/mo

Bills: $300 (Does not include car insurance as paid in full all the way to June 2020 already)

Food: $400/mo

Now debts...
Car: $9,600 with monthly payments of $306 at 1.84% interest. At that rate, I’m thinking about continuing minimum payments or kick it up $350.

Credit Card: $7,000. I’ve designated $3,000 each month to come out of my paycheck the next 2 months so this WILL be paid in full no later than October.

Student Loans: $120,000 at $1,400/mo. Currently in process of refinancing from 6.14% to 5.4%. I still feel like I can beat 5.4%.

This is where I know I am wrong. I have no emergency fund. I’m being cocky and arrogant in this regard in that I am very fortunate with parents that have $$$ and would easily give me if something were to happen. I do work in specialized field in healthcare that does not get laid off and am in demand. I suppose I could get fired for negligence, but I go into work with patient first aspect and am not that type of person that is a lazy worker.

Checking/Savings: $150. I’ve been throwing all my cash into debt. Feel like I’m better off getting rid of debt rather than putting money away in savings outside of retirement. Don’t know see how I can get a better return right now than the piece of mind of watching a 6%, $120k crater leave my name.

Back in May, I decided to switch from ATT postpaid plan to a prepaid one. Somewhere along the lines, something got messed up. Apparently, they had been continuing to charge me for data even though the original postpaid account should have been closed. Now I have a bill of $1200 that I have no idea how to pay. I have tried contacting them since I first got notification about the bill, but I have just been getting the run around ever since then. I got a letter in the mail that I'm on my final notice and that the account would be sent to collections fairly soon. They keep telling me that the charges are valid and that there is basically no way of reversing them, so I guess I'm going to have to figure out some way of paying it even though I never got any notice or bill that I was still being charged after I switched my account to prepaid.

I've been working on increasing my credit score as of late and have been doing fairly well, getting it to almost 700. And I've heard that collections can seriously ruin that and any decent chances at a good score. I'm 23 and will be graduating college in two more years, so I don't want something major that would affect my chances in the future. I stumbled upon LendingClub while browsing CreditKarma and was wondering if a personal loan is a good route to take instead of maxing out the pair of credit cards that I do have.

I'm 23, I bring in about $1000 a month. I have car payments at $230 (about $7000 remaining on the loan) and a phone bill at $60. I suppose I could also use the loan to pay off my remaining credit card debt &lt;$1500 too, but I'm not really sure what is a good route to take. I bank with Wells Fargo and Navy Fed (prior military) if either of those provides better loan options.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Though at one point she owned the house outright, because of chronic spending issues she now has a reverse mortgage with $200K in principal growing at 5% per year.

I'm her only child, not currently a homeowner, and have just shy of $100K saved up for a down payment.

Recently, my mom brought up how much the reverse mortgage is bothering her, and that she is considering selling her home so she could buy something smaller and without a reverse mortgage. However, she would **strongly** prefer to remain where she is, but she hates that her financial irresponsibility has resulted in this reverse mortgage and wants out.

During that conversation, the possibility was brought up that we convert the reverse mortgage to an outright mortgage, and that I take on responsibility for the payments. For me, this would be out of the question without some security measures in place, and even then I'm still unsure.

I was looking into an irrevocable trust.  The idea would be that the home is transferred to the trust and the reverse mortgage converted to a 15-year mortgage, either on the $200K or some smaller amount based on how much of my savings I decided to put in. I would then be the responsible party for making the mortgage payments and the property taxes on her home. We'd also want an additional non-beneficiary trustee to be added to prevent perceived (or actual) impropriety.

The only real benefit of such a potential arrangement is saving my mother (and me) from her financial irresponsibility. Without her home under her control, she couldn't continue to accrue credit card debt and bail herself out by giving up more of her home. Then, the assets of the house would be available to her in the case of emergency. What I would need would be some legal entitlement to the $200K plus future interest accrued, in the same vein as the bank currently holding the reverse mortgage.

Is something like this possible?  What are the potential downsides?

We&amp;#39;d also want an additional non-beneficiary trustee to be added to prevent perceived (or actual) impropriety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real benefit of such a potential arrangement is saving my mother (and me) from her financial irresponsibility. Without her home under her control, she couldn&amp;#39;t continue to accrue credit card debt and bail herself out by giving up more of her home. Then, the assets of the house would be available to her in the case of emergency. What I would need would be some legal entitlement to the $200K plus future interest accrued, in the same vein as the bank currently holding the reverse mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is something like this possible?  What are the potential downsides?  Is there another way to achieve a similar result?&lt;/p&gt;

Throwaway account… Need help with retired family member’s finances who is claiming they’re now destitute. Something seems fishy to me, and I need pointers on what advice to give.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finance Breakdown:**

* State of Residence: NJ
* Family Member Age: 70 (never married, no children, retired at the age of 42 in the early 90s, had inheritance from my grandmother/great aunt to live on in addition to a pension and IRA) 

**Income:** 

* $26,000 annually from social security and his pension
* Said he made $160,000 from the sale of his townhouse in 2014 (when he moved into the apartment he’s currently living in) – said he put it into his investment account, withdrew about $45,000 from it annually, and it is now gone.
* Claiming an IRA and investment account are now tapped. In 2009 or 2010, I had spoken with him and his financial advisor was present, who mentioned that there was about $1,000,000 in his investment account alone (not including social security/pension or even his IRA I don’t think) – this is what seems really fishy to me? Wouldn’t he need to be drawing something like $100k+ annually to drain that entirely by now??   


Important to note that he doesn’t make any of his own investment choices, and his financial advisor who manages his portfolio is a fiduciary advisor who has been in business for decades (the firm also handled my grandparent’s money, and also my tiny IRA)… I don’t see them making risky investments, and I thought the market had been doing well the past few years?

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses (Annual):**

* No credit card, car, or other debt.
* Rent: $24,780
* Food: $7,500
* Prescriptions: $7,200
* Country Club: $4,000
* Federal &amp; State Taxes: $3,000
* Medicare Gap Coverage: $2,784
* Tax Installment Payment (for a past IRA withdrawal): $1,800
* Medicare: $1,608
* Electric: $1,500
* Cable/Phone: $1,500
* Car Insurance: $1,400
* Investment Portfolio Management Fee: $1,000
* Medicare Part D Coverage: $897.60
* Gas (Car): $800
* Gas (Utility): $500
* Laundry / Dry Cleaning: $500
* Tax Preparation: $300
* Renter's Insurance: $125
* Apartment Maintenance Crew Gratuity: $120
* Oil Changes (Car): $100
* Car Registration: $40  


**Total: $61,454.60**

  

**My Advice Plan:**

He’s asking me to make up the difference between what he spends per year and what he makes off social security/pension per year. There’s no fucking way that’s happening. He literally spends about twice what I spend in a year (I live in a HCOL area), I just paid off my last student loan this year, finally saved up an emergency fund in 2018, and was able to contribute to my own IRA for the first time in 2018. I will have no pension, I’m 10 years behind on retirement savings, and graduated college during the recession. I make okay, steady money, but I’m not a fucking millionaire (I make less than $100k per year). Even just the fact that he thinks I could somehow manage that is enraging to me and shows how out-of-touch with reality he is…

But, I’m going to offer advice:

* He already acquiesced that he has to cut his country club membership. He doesn’t play golf, he doesn’t play tennis, he literally was paying this club thousands of dollars per year to be able to hang out there and for nostalgia. FFS…
* He has to move, he says is lease is up in August. I’m going to tell him to look for places that are no more than 25 – 30% of his annual income…But I’m almost wondering if that should be even lower?
* I’m thinking I’m going to recommend he move out of NJ. It’s a really expensive state to live in, and while he grew up in NJ, he has no family left there. I was thinking of recommending states like North Carolina or Tennessee which I think are cheaper in both taxes and cost of living?
* I’m going to tell him to stop giving gratuities to people if he can’t afford to support himself.
* I’m going to tell him that he has to drastically reduce his food budget. He eats out every meal. His food budget is insane.
* He needs to stop buying clothes that need to be dry cleaned and start doing his own laundry.
* I think he should consider getting a part-time job – I know this will go over about as well as a lead balloon. He hasn’t worked at all since the early 90s, has never used a computer, and refuses to learn.  
   
 

**My questions:**

* Do pensions or social security “run out?” Does he need to worry that those sources of income will go away?
* What's a good target for housing per month? Is 25 - 30% of his income still okay in his situation or lower?
* Are pensions and social security taxed? If he lives in an apartment and doesn’t work, WTF is he paying federal and state taxes on?
* Is there a way to reduce any of his medical expenses? Does he actually need Medicare Part D and Gap coverage? He says the prescriptions he takes that can be generic already are, so I don’t know that there’s a way to reduce the cost of his prescriptions… He’s diabetic, obese, and has severe arthritis, those are the health issues I know about.
* Does he really need renter’s insurance, or is it a rip-off? 
* Any other advice I can give him? Any other resources that might be available for seniors for housing/help with finding a small job/budgeting?
* Am I right that something else happened here to drain his investment/IRA like that? He's saying it's just the annual expenses listed, plus a used car purchase a couple years back when his old car died and some dentistry work last year (totaling $3,000). Is there more to this story?   


**Backstory:** 

I (currently 32 years old) was just contacted by an estranged uncle (he’s now 70). I haven’t heard from him in 6 years. We didn’t see each other much when I was growing up, maybe once a year. We were close when I was in college and for a couple years after graduating, but he stopped speaking to me when I refused to take up financially supporting my mother after my father divorced her and got remarried (they’d lived separately since I was 5 but my dad had been paying her essentially non-court ordered alimony since they separated, the new wife – logically enough – said that had to stop). My mother’s a long story… She has a lot of mental health/substance abuse issues, and not only was I in a mountain of student loan debt but honestly, she was a fucking shitty mother, and I refused to threaten my financial security to enable her. My uncle’s view was that she was my family and I needed to make the payments to her that my father was stopping… He wanted me to give her about $14,000 a year, essentially for the rest of her life. Even if I’d wanted to, I wouldn’t have been able to make those payments.  


So, anyway… My uncle retired in 1991 when he was 42. He was a senior VP at an investment bank in NYC, and they offered him early retirement with a pension in lieu of a lay-off. Instead of getting another job, he took care of my elderly great aunt and grandmother until they passed away (great aunt passed in 1998, grandmother in 2001). He inherited a fair sum from both of them and lived off that rather than returning to work (no idea what the actual amount was…).   
 

He has no children and never got married. He was averse to owning property for some reason, and rented for the majority of his life. He did eventually buy a townhouse in NJ, but sold in 2014 and moved in to another apartment. He said he made about $160,000 from the sale of his townhouse, but that’s gone. He never travels.  


I’m not heartless, but the situation makes me really angry. Just that he could be asking me for this large amount of support and thinking that I’d actually have it to give, like there’s no comprehension how insane of an ask this is of anyone, let alone someone he hasn’t been willing to speak to for 6 years… But, that's all aside the point now, I guess.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway account… Need help with retired family member’s finances who is claiming they’re now destitute.

OK, I started my PF journey about 3 years ago, fresh out of school with 100k in student debt and a job that almost makes all that debt worth it.  I've been living frugally (at one point too frugally. It was actually a problem...) and paying it down/establishing myself. Unfortunately I've developed a bit of an unhealthy fear of spending money which I'm working on and am making progress on, but thats for /r/therapy, not here, lol

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Current picture:\*\* 28 Y/O, down to 50k student loans (35k at 5.45%, the rest at 3.5%). 15K E-fund + sinking funds for medical and car repairs. Takehome is 4k a month and my non-debt expenditures are usually around 2.5k. On average about 2k-2.5k a month goes to debt or savings, after averaging in my 3 paycheck months and the guaranteed portion of my yearly bonus (it's base + performance). My SO has loans similar to what I started with, but her income just doubled and she will be able to pay hers off within 10yrs. We aren't married yet, but thats something to consider.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Goals:\*\* Goal is to have student loans paid off in about 3 years (Conservative estimate). After that I'll max my 401k for 19k a year, and the goal is to retire in my early to mid 60s (63-65). I dont honestly have aspirations to retire lean or early, just to be able to hang up my tie and continue living the same QoL that I had while working. I do want to own a house (because a house means having a 2 car garage), so I'll start saving towards 100kish for downpayment + closing + home repair fund. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Heres the rub: I am, and have been since I could talk, a car guy. My only major splurge since starting my career was a fun daily (used Scion FR-S, paid cash of course), and I love it, prior to that I've always leaned towards fun no matter the budget (old integras/civics etc). I do AutoX with it, go to meets, etc, but it is a daily, and my only car, so I dont track it, mod it crazy, etc. I plan to drive it until god sees fit to take it from me. And even then he'll have to fight me for it. But the thing I love most about cars is building, restoring, and racing, experiences you cant really get with a daily (nevermind that a daily also needs to be safe, reliable, and practical, which a second car doesn't necessarily need)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After loans are paid off I'd like to spend 15k or so on a nice fun weekend car (cash of course). A convertible of some sort I can take to the LA canyons, cruise around with the SO in, track without worrying about crashing my commuter, keep nice and maybe tastefully modded, and drive until its damn near considered a classic. Probably a used vette (reliable but bit large, with a community filled with old men that dont drive them), or ideally a 987 boxter (yes, I know porsches are expensive to maintain, but I do most of my work myself. All my dream cars have been porsches, from the modern GT3s to the now unobtainable classic aircooled models that wont stop appreciating long enough for normal people to buy them). Once I have a home and a full garage of my own I'd also love to get a true classic to slowly restore on my own, probably a 240Z or maybe a 944T if neither have shot up in value by then.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Long story short: Am I a fucking idiot?\*\* Do I need to just get a couple models to stare at or videogames to play until after I have a house paid off and am on the cusp of retirement, or is this an ok dream to have? I have a hard time telling if I'm rationalizing a decision by thinking it will be ok, or just combatting my past attitude that spending any money at all is wrong. Basically I have 2 voices in my head and I don't have the perspective to decide which one is lying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Before anyone asks, I don't fit in any of the ""good"" miatas. I'd have to swap to an airbagless steering wheel to fit in an NA (and cut the foam out of the seat), and thats just not a risk I like in a car that will see \~3k a year of driving. an NB would be even worse. So unfortunately the dream of the 2k guilt free roadster doesn't work for me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; thanks for the sanity check guys. “You’re an idiot” is a valid answer and looks like the right one. I’ll save the daydreaming for a much later date, once i’m fully “ok” financially (maybe once I pay off a house?). Planning on wasting 5 figures on bullshit is stupid, even if you wait until you aren’t in debt to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I started my PF journey about 3 years ago, fresh out of school with 100k in student debt and a job that almost makes all that debt worth it.  I&amp;#39;ve been living frugally (at one point too frugally. It was actually a problem...) and paying it down/establishing myself. Unfortunately I&amp;#39;ve developed a bit of an unhealthy fear of spending money which I&amp;#39;m working on and am making progress on, but thats for &lt;a href=""/r/therapy""&gt;/r/therapy&lt;/a&gt;, not here, lol&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Current picture:** 28 Y/O, down to 50k student loans (35k at 5.45%, the rest at 3.5%). 15K E-fund + sinking funds for medical and car repairs. Takehome is 4k a month and my non-debt expenditures are usually around 2.5k. On average about 2k-2.5k a month goes to debt or savings, after averaging in my 3 paycheck months and the guaranteed portion of my yearly bonus (it&amp;#39;s base + performance). My SO has loans similar to what I started with, but her income just doubled and she will be able to pay hers off within 10yrs.

A bit of background about myself:

I have just finished my first year of university and am swiftly moving onto the next (studying in the UK). I have a summer job paying £8.21 an hour and a term time job paying a similar wage. Between this and my 4500 pound annual  maintenance loan I can take care of myself for the year. This does mean between my school fees and maintenance loan fees I am accumulating a debt of just of over 13k a year with an interest rate of about 6%. I also have access to a £1000 overdraft which has no interest for a year, not something I particularly need to use at the moment. 

I have no other significant financial barriers in my life at the moment. 

My plan 

I was originally going to put it into a savings account and an ISA but they all have crap interest rates. My current idea is to set aside a grand for any expenses that might suddenly crop up. Just leave this in a savings account taking the crap interest rate but its money that I can access at a moments notice. I was also going to put about 13 grand into a HSBC investment account, choose 6 funds and put just over 2 grand in each and watch it grow. As for the remaining grand I was going to create a standing order to put 250 pound into what HSBC call their regular saver. I can put up to 250 a month into it and im not allowed to touch it. At the end of the year they will give me 3% on what ever is in the regular saver. This obviously only gives me 4 months of run way but between birthdays christmas's,overtime,holiday pay and any money I can take out of my investment account I can cover the other 2 grand. I was also thinking the interest from this could offset any losses which might result from a bad performance of  a fund.

&amp;#x200B;

As to why im not paying off my debt. The student debt Only needs to be paid back once I make more than 27k a year. Also its more like a tax as any thing I make over 27k will be ""taxed"" at 9% (I think its 9). Not only this but the money I believe can be better spent. It can be used to cover rent for the year or used to put a deposit down on a house or buy me a car so I can commute to work. All of this gives me ""better earnings potential"" than simply paying the debt

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound like a reasonable plan and do you have any other suggestions. 

Thank you

Also its more like a tax as any thing I make over 27k will be &amp;quot;taxed&amp;quot; at 9% (I think its 9). Not only this but the money I believe can be better spent. It can be used to cover rent for the year or used to put a deposit down on a house or buy me a car so I can commute to work. All of this gives me &amp;quot;better earnings potential&amp;quot; than simply paying the debt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this sound like a reasonable plan and do you have any other suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

Well the first week that we received payment from Unum, she found another job and put in her two weeks.  She told them to cancel short term disability because she wouldn't need it anymore since she's leaving the company.  They confirmed it and said the paperwork was sent in. 

The week she started her new job we saw a new deposit in our account from Unum for one week's salary.  So my wife called up her old company and questioned it.  They told her the paperwork was sent in already and it should have stopped.  So she called Unum directly and they said it was an error on their part and they will withdraw it back.  

So we waited two weeks and nothing happened.  My wife who works in finance said they have two weeks to withdraw money from our account before the bank won't allow them to do it so since they went past that date, another arrangement needed to be made.  So she called Unum back and asked them why wasn't it taken out of our account.  They told her they have no record of it and no record of talking to her before on it and to them they see everything as perfect on their end.

She tells them she hasn't worked at that company for over six weeks.  Unum said there's nothing they can do because her old company approved it.  She tells them to stop payments and to take the money back out.  

So we wait another two weeks and they never do it again.  The money is still in there.  So we move it to savings again so we don't spend it.

My question is.. will their audit system find this?  I mean they said my wife's old company approved the disability so Unum thinks these two payments are 100% valid.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have no idea if i should do it or not, i don&amp;#39;t have any savings due to my current situation.&lt;/p&gt;

While living in the US, I continued to use my UK debit card to pay for things as it has a good exchange rate and no international fees. I use a modern, digital bank which has a great app showing all of my payments in real time. 

In the UK, we rarely ever swipe our cards (only PIN and contactless which withdraws payment immediately), whereas in the US it seems like at most restaurants and hotels when swiping, a hold is placed on the card, it remains pending for a few days, then gets taken out. I guess more people use credit cards? I’m not sure. 

On quite a few occasions, the pending hold would appear on my account straight away then a few days later, it would get reversed and I’d get the money back. This didn’t happen at every restaurant but a fair few, around $30-50 a time. The most that ever reversed was about $200 from a hotel stay. All of these transactions were over the course of a year and not one was taken back out of my account.

US: Illinois - Chicago, near suburbs
37 y/o; soon-to-be-officially-single dad. Two elementary age kids, living with me half time.

income: 55k 
Savings: currently about 20k, I anticipate about 10k after divorce is final.
No debt at all once this house sells (car is paid off in one more payment, CC balances are paid in full every month)
If it matters, excellent (825+) credit.

This was the first home I've ever bought, so it's the first one I'll ever sell. Currently the difference between our sale price (after broker fees, lawyer fees, etc.) minus the remaining principal is about $120k. Divided in half (soon-to-be-ex-wife gets the other half), that's 60k. Do I walk away with all of that? Is there anything I'm missing? Is it taxed? If so, how do I estimate how much? Also if taxed, is it at time of sale or on my tax return after the end of this year?

Onto the rent budget question (with the above info in mind):

I've never been the most educated about budgeting, etc. I've always been fortunate enough to have a lifestyle-income ratio that made it so I didn't have to pay super close attention to budgeting.

Without having a clear sense of what my future budget was going to look like, I ballparked my rent budget until now (only went under contract on the home last week) at ideally 1500-1600, but willing to go to 1900, especially if some utilities, parking, or some other perk was included. Everything I'm finding in that range, though, is missing some of the things I want for my kids and me in our new home. On a personal values level, having a comfortable home for us is a big priority for me, but obviously I'm limited by my budget.

If my earlier assumptions are correct (I'm walking away with 60k take home, plus my already existing savings), can I afford to increase my rent budget to 2500/mo? I know this is WAY over the 1/3 of income rule of thumb but....

My figuring is this: One year at that increased rent will be an extra $7,000 (approx) paid in rent (over my previous top-of-budget). I still have over $50k of my profit on my house, and have had a year to figure out if that housing expense is sustainable with my new lifestyle post-divorce.

Would love to hear any thoughts/insights.

Also, I know that if I pay tax on that home sale, that changes things significantly.

I'm an authorized user on 2 of my parents credit card accounts. I haven't actually used either of those two cards in probably about two years, but I'm still on them.

Am I going to be in danger because of this in any way? I'm annoyed because we didn't get to talk it over at all. My dad didn't even talk to my mom about it. He just suddenly did it out of nowhere. My mom is concerned they may somehow be able to take my savings or something.

Not sure if this is the right forum, but I have a feeling this miiight be some sort of a scam, but not sure.

Ok, background - my mother-in-law is a single, just turned 60 year old lady in a Baltic country (Eastern Europe). She has two grown-up children (including my wife) and a medium-sized house and shared garden with her son. Income is ok for sustaining herself, maybe little savings, but nothing significant.
She has been single for the past 10 years or so.

Now, the story develops over the past two weeks (we found out about it a week ago). Apparently there is this US Army officer/doctor (don’t have the exact details on all of this but please bear with me), who is on his last mission before going into retirement, he is 62.
So somehow he has found my MIL online (Facebook) and they are exchanging long messages and chats all day. His background is that he had a wife and kid from our country, who passed away in a car crash some years ago, so he is seeking for someone to ‘age beautifully’ with, but from the same country.

Apparently the messages are very passionate, he is already speaking of moving to our country after his mission ends and moving in together with her.
The latest info is that he’s asking her to go to Asia with him (they haven’t met yet). However, we stressed that they need to meet here first.
They are conversing in English and she is extremely happy that she has found someone. But all this seems very odd to me. 

Another weird point is that even though they started speaking on Facebook, he said that due to army rules he can’t use it a lot and asked to move the convo to ‘hangout’, which I think is a dating app.

All this seems very strange and a ‘dream come true’ for a 60 year old. However, I can’t really come up with a scam strategy...

So when my stepdad got the check from the sale, he cashed it and then wrote one to me for the same amount, minus money for a furnace.

Could that portion be considered a gift?  

If so, follow up: The gift of equity is over the annual amount, but the check was below. Could the combined amount be considered a gift from my mom and stepdad below the $30k limit to avoid the form on their end?

My tax situation for TY2019 is expected to be one W2 and one 1099, both myself.  We are MFJ with 2 kids, lIving and working in MA (though the 1099 is from RI).

I found out recently that my employer matches dollar-for-dollar the first $2500 we put into dependant-care FSA.  Being as my wife is a SAHM, I never much payed attention to it...however we recently had our second and I have until EOB Friday to change my benefits and elect DC-FSA since we recently had our second child.

We are considering putting our first in preschool this fall.  Since she doesn't work, I know I'll have to pay taxes at the end of the year for money used out of DC-FSA...but with the matching funds, would it make sense anyway for me to start contributing?  The preschool is only about $200/mo, but every little bit helps, ya know?  This way I would pay $100 and get an extra $100 match.  I suppose I'd be paying taxes on $200/mo at tax time, but it seems that $100 of that would almost be a raise, of sorts.

Thoughts?

My goal is to aggressively attack my credit card debt while saving some money and enjoying a modest social life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a spreadsheet of my financial situation:  [https://imgur.com/a/adUB9NO](https://imgur.com/a/adUB9NO)

I am very concerned about my $500 monthly food and fun allotment and being able to stick to that but will try my hardest.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have to purchase a vehicle next week.  I have budgeted up to $300 per month for an auto loan and am willing to put up to $2000 down on the vehicle.  I am giving myself a firm $20,000 out the door price limit and ideally want that number closer to $15,000. I expect my APR to be between 4%-6% with my credit score of 708.

Assuming that I do put down the $2,000, then I have $4700 cash in my bank account.  I am considering putting all of that towards my Discover Card.

&amp;#x200B;

**Credit Debt Plan:** 

My debt plan is to avalanche my debt, starting with my Discover Card. After the car purchase I plan to transfer my Discover card balance to a 0% introductory rate card.  Given my experience with this in the past I don't believe I will be approved to transfer the full balance.  So whatever is left over I plan to pay off immediately.  Then do the same on the Capital One card in October, and again with the Citi Card in February 2020.  As long as those cards are at 0% I am comfortable paying the minimum monthly and putting money towards my next highest interest rate, which in this case would be the 6.5% from one of my student loans.  

*Is this a good plan?*

**Savings Plan:**

I have an HSA with my new employer where they contribute $3000 at the beginning of every calendar year without me having to contribute anything. I don't plan to contribute anything additional for the first year or two, even though I know there are tax incentives. I think that money is better off being spent on attacking my credit debt first.  I am in good health and don't have any recurring medical expenses.  

*Thoughts?*

I will be eligible to start on the 401K plan at the beginning of 2021.  The company contributes 10% of your base salary every year, without requiring you to contribute anything.  However I would like to be in a position by that time to contribute.  

I plan to squirrel away 10% of each paycheck into an account for emergencies and vacations and those types of things.

Is this a good looking plan?  Would you do anything different?  Did I miss any details?  Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has taken me a few years to climb in my career to a point where I can actually make a plan for my financial life beyond &amp;quot;pay everything on time and pray for no surprises&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to aggressively attack my credit card debt while saving some money and enjoying a modest social life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a spreadsheet of my financial situation:  &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/adUB9NO""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/adUB9NO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very concerned about my $500 monthly food and fun allotment and being able to stick to that but will try my hardest.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to purchase a vehicle next week.  I have budgeted up to $300 per month for an auto loan and am willing to put up to $2000 down on the vehicle.  I am giving myself a firm $20,000 out the door price limit and ideally want that number closer to $15,000. I expect my APR to be between 4%-6% with my credit score of 708.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that I do put down the $2,000, then I have $4700 cash in my bank account.  I am considering putting all of that towards my Discover Card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit Debt Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My debt plan is to avalanche my debt, starting with my Discover Card. After the car purchase I plan to transfer my Discover card balance to a 0% introductory rate card.  Given my experience with this in the past I don&amp;#39;t believe I will be approved to transfer the full balance.  So whatever is left over I plan to pay off immediately.  Then do the same on the Capital One card in October, and again with the Citi Card in February 2020.  As long as those cards are at 0% I am comfortable paying the minimum monthly and putting money towards my next highest interest rate, which in this case would be the 6.5% from one of my student loans.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this a good plan?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savings Plan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have an HSA with my new employer where they contribute $3000 at the beginning of every calendar year without me having to contribute anything. I don&amp;#39;t plan to contribute anything additional for the first year or two, even though I know there are tax incentives. I think that money is better off being spent on attacking my credit debt first.  I am in good health and don&amp;#39;t have any recurring medical expenses.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be eligible to start on the 401K plan at the beginning of 2021.  The company contributes 10% of your base salary every year, without requiring you to contribute anything.  However I would like to be in a position by that time to contribute.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to squirrel away 10% of each paycheck into an account for emergencies and vacations and those types of things.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

But I just need some advice on how to proceed. 

So I’ve been living in my apartment in Texas for about 7 months.  It’s a great community and I love it. But it’s expensive. I was able to afford it at the beginning of my lease, but some things have come up that have left me scrambling to pay my rent the past couple of months. Last month, I was five days late on rent, so there’s the late fees for that, which I haven’t paid because I’m unable to, and now I’m late on this month’s rent which I don’t even have enough for the base amount due, let alone the fees. Nobody has contacted me about eviction in any way whatsoever, but I’m just waiting for it to come any day now. I don’t know the laws or process when it comes to how eviction works, I’ve never had to deal with it because I’ve always been pretty good about paying everything on time. But this year has been different. I’ve had to sell some of my stuff to make rent and I did not like that. But that’s beside the point. I know that I have the option to terminate my lease at any time without any repercussions. It won’t go on my credit report and won’t affect me in the future when I try to rent/buy. But I will have to give a 60 day notice and also pay ~$2200 within 3 days of moving out. The thing is, I don’t know if I’d be able to pay that amount within that time frame. Maybe most of it, but definitely not all of it. 

I don’t know what to do about this, any advice would be appreciated. 

Tl;dr - scared about getting evicted; should I let it happen, or beat them to the punch and terminate my lease at the risk of not being able to pay the fees in full within 30 days?

Thank you to everyone who has responded to my post about this. I appreciate all of the feedback. I feel better knowing my next step and will go ahead and terminate my lease early so I avoid getting evicted.

My husband and H both are using GI bills that we've budgeted to pay for our housing year round.
We were originally planning on renting an apartment, but the more we discuss moving there, the more we want to stay there after school. We both have job security there as well for when we graduate. I graduate in 1.5 years, my husband and H graduate in 4 more years (both dual majoring). My husband doesn't want to move inbetween semesters, so once we move we will be living in that place for at least 4 years.

The more I think about renting, the more I dislike it. I don't like the idea of putting money towards rent and never owning, when we could buy a new construction property in the area for the same cost. I understand renting is more 'secure' if something major happened to the place, but I'd really like to own, have equity, and do what I wish to my home.

Husband and I discuss this often as we plan to move early 2020, and his biggest worry is the unfairness for H. He feels like H is getting the worst deal because he's helping us pay for mortgage without owning any of the property. Husband and I also couldn't come up with an agreement on how we would set up rent, I said maybe 45/55 depending on bedroom sizes, husband says 30/70 because H will have no equity, but that sounds crazy! We have not brought this up to H yet, as too much is in the air. Even though, H is really chill about everything else housing wise we've talked about and didn't care if we split an apartment 50/50, including utilities, though we would get the master. We've even discussed a 3rd bedroom being the work room for my husband and H, and any extra storage/garage for H (if we buy, the house would have at least 2 garage spots though). 

If it matters: our budget is $1,400 when looking at apartments, split 50/50 with roommate. But for mortgages, we've been pre-approved for mortgages no more than $12-1300/month with insurance and taxes included in the monthly mortgage.

We are curious, what would be a good price to charge for rent in this scenario? Would it be bad of us to discuss buying/building a home instead of getting an apartment like we first discussed to H? Is that even any of his business?

I need some guidance on a few things. In no particular order:

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have my 401k with Fidelity. So far the account ($1500) is allocated to the TRP RETIREMENT 2045 plan. In addition, I have a $5000 rollover check on its way to Fidelity from my last job. Should I go Roth for the 5K or stick with the 401k rollover? The fees for the TRP Retirement are 0.72%, so I need to move it somewhere else. 

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I have $9000 in wedding gifts sitting around, earning Wells Fargo a profit, and us, fuck all. Where is a good place to put it? My initial thought was to keep it liquid as an emergency fund. On the other hand, my husband is self employed and makes less than $20k a year. No retirement plan, and no retirement savings. We are both 38. Should some of it be used to begin retirement savings for him?   

 

Our only two debts are mine: $4000 left on a car payment and $55000 in student loans after I graduate next fall. Is there a proportion of how much should be allocated to retirement and investments, and how much should go to debt?

Was never able to save til now, just started a great job a few months ago.

Income: $3,300 Month, this is net income

Car Debt: $16,000. This is over the next 5 years. Was a six year loan for $19,000, very low interest sub 3.

Credit Card Debt: $2,000. This is on a zero interest credit card, at least for now. I want to attack this first just to get rid of the balance.

Total Debt: $18,000 (no student loans)

Savings: Just a few hundred

Retirement: Nothing, but just opened a Roth IRA. Job does not offer a 401K.

Credit Score: 790, if this is needed at all.

Trying to save for a House in a couple years and also trying to get all debt paid off. Houses in this area are about $330k, so want to put 5% down. That's around 10K each saved for my fiancee and I in the next two years.

&amp;#x200B;

Expenses:

Rent $580.00 (split house rent with fiancee)

Car Payment $275.00

Car Insurance $130

Power $85.00

Water $60.00

Cell Phone $50.00

Haircut $30.00

Gas $15.00

Car Gas $225.00 (commute)

Internet $25

Youtube Red $10

Credit Card $250 (in order to get paid off before interest hits)

Dog Expenses $70.00 (No kid expenses yet thankfully lol)

Gym $20.00

Roth IRA $100.00  (Will raise this to $500.00 once have enough saved for House Down Payment and Car Paid Off)

Emergency Savings $175.00

Travel $150.00

Food $300.00

Take Out $100.00

House Down Payment Savings $400.00

Extra Car Payment $300.00

Total

&amp;#x200B;

$3,350.00

&amp;#x200B;

This obviously leaves me with no spending money which isn't realistic. Should I not pay extra on my car until the Credit Card Debt is paid off? Which will be just 6-7 months. Then I would have $250-300 of spending money to work around with

I am 27 years old and currently live in the US. Originally I'm from Europe, so that's also where most of my savings are. 

I have around 85,000$ (75,000€) in my savings in my European bank account. I have around 30,000$ here in my bank and am currently too afraid to do something with it. I'm working as a freelancer and since I moved not too long ago I am not too sure on how the situation will be so I'd rather use my 30k as an emergency fund. I do not have any debt and a good credit score.

I am super risk averse and if I could, I would stack my money under my bed so I can see it all the time (not literally, but that's how I feel about the situation).

I realized that it might be smart to invest at least a part of my money in Europe, which is currently just sitting around in my bank account with a very low return rate (0.1% as far as I know).

I love this subreddit and tried to find something right for me in the guidelines, but every person has a different story and without enough knowledge I'm even more afraid to invest my money into something I am not sure of. 

I recently had a talk with my bank guy and he told me to invest 20k in something with almost no return - I think the maximum is a 1.5% but without any risk. I did say yes to that - now in retrospect I am not sure if that was a smart idea. The money can always be taken out but depending on the market I might lose a bit. 

I currently do not have a retirement plan (I graduated from university two years ago, then moved and had many other costs coming up - hence no retirement plan atm). 

Any advice on how to handle my situation would be highly appreciated.

My question is, what do I need to do to ensure I can get Illinois license plates, insurance, register the car, etc.

Do I need my dad to transfer the title to me or at least add me as a co-owner?

Regarding insurance, I assume he will have to take me off his policy and I'll need to purchase my own, or should we check my dad's insurance policy to see if they will extend coverage in this situation?

I just don't want to add any extra overhead or costs that aren't necessary for all parties involved.

So I bring home $1172 a week (salaried) working for my fathers business. I have no real expenses as I still live at home and my parents take care of my car insurance (incentive for being a supervisor at the company) and I have another car that is paid off. I have 4 credit cards, all are at a $0 balance as of right now. I’ve offered to pay rent but my parents tell me to save up for my own house, I feel bad so I end up buying some stuff for the house like water, toilet paper, etc. I pay for Apple Music ($10 a month), Crunchyroll ($6.95 a month), iCloud storage ($1 a month) and just cancelled a few other things so I’m currently at around $18 a month for subscriptions. Now onto the truck

The truck is a 2017 F250 Super Duty. I think it’s a really pretty truck and I’ve wanted one of the newer body styles since they came out. Now that I have one, I’m starting to fall back to earth and realize I might have made a bad choice. I put $3k down on it and my loan is ~$35k. $550 for 72 months. Now before you jump down my throat let me explain. I’m usually not a financially irresponsible person. I know that seems like a bad purchase, because it probably was, but I thought I could justify putting $1000 a month towards the payments and paying it off in under 3 years. I still could do that, but who knows what financial situation I’ll be in 3 years from now. Not saying my job status is likely to change negatively any time soon but who knows, anything can happen in 3 years.

So my question is, what do more financially responsible and overall wiser redditors think I should do? My monthly expenses as of right now are extremely low compared to my income, and cutting out $1000 a month from a truck payment could make moving out of my parents house much easier on my bank account. However, I haven’t even made a payment on my truck (first payment due on July 28th). I feel like I’ll be upside down on a vehicle I didn’t even get to enjoy, it just doesn’t sit well with me.

I've been looking into refinancing and despite the overwhelming amount of advice couldn't figure it all out on my own so decided to ask the experts.

Basic details:

* I'm 25 years old and **just** finished my Master's in Athletic Training
* My **monthly income** after taxes is **$3200**, this is my **first month** on my **new job @ a Public University**
* Currently the I have an **extra $1000** coming in from a different teaching position
* I plan to **pay $1200 monthly** **towards** my **loans**
* I have an excellent **credit score \~760**
* My **mom** **cosigned** the **loans**
* My **income** will **not change** for the next **2 years**

All my **private loans** are through **Discover for $63,340**. Details about my private loans:

* One **account balance is $52,640** and has these consolidated loans that have **payment deferred until May 2020**:
   * **$22,000** @ interest rate of **5.490% fixed** , deferred interest balance of $560
   * **$14,000** @ interest rate of **5.240% variable**, deferred interest balance of $197
   * **$16,640** @ interest rate of **5.115% variable**, deferred interest balance of $385
* Second account amount balance is **$10,700** @ interest rate of **4.740%** **variable**, minimum payment due of $25, deferred interest balance of $63, principal $292, interest $757

**Federal loan** is **$20,000** @ interest rate of **3.4%**, it's been deferred till July 2020.

**Questions:**

* Is variable interest rate bad currently/in my situation?
* Should I look into refinancing my private loans now though my major private loan is deferred currently?
* From this sub it seems like I should keep the federal loan and think of income based repayment (IBR) is that accurate?
* How should I go about paying these off? I've heard about the strategy where you pay off the highest interest loan first after minimum payment on all, but most of my loans are deferred, am I better of starting to pay them now?
* Since my annual income is &gt;70k, I've read that student loan interest can be deducted up to $2,500, is this helpful to me in anyway?

Any/all advice would be appreciated. Thank you for helping a newbie out in advance!

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federal loan&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;$20,000&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;3.4%&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;#39;s been deferred till July 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is variable interest rate bad currently/in my situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I look into refinancing my private loans now though my major private loan is deferred currently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From this sub it seems like I should keep the federal loan and think of income based repayment (IBR) is that accurate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should I go about paying these off? I&amp;#39;ve heard about the strategy where you pay off the highest interest loan first after minimum payment on all, but most of my loans are deferred, am I better of starting to pay them now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since my annual income is &amp;gt;70k, I&amp;#39;ve read that student loan interest can be deducted up to $2,500, is this helpful to me in anyway?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any/all advice would be appreciated. Thank you for helping a newbie out in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

My in laws are getting on in age and they want to sell their vacation home (in a state neither they nor my husband and I live in) to us to get some retirement money.

Just joined and it looks like there are those with some valuable advice out there that could be very useful. 

I currently work for a large Aerospace company as a Project Manager and make $80k-$90k a year supporting a family of 4 in one of the highest housing markets in the country, so that salary isn’t going as far it it would in the cheaper states in the country. I’d like my wife to stay home with the kids because of all the benefits that go along with her doing that, so I’d like to have an income that will help provide the best I can for my family. 

I’m 27 years old with about 8 years of experience in Manufacturing, 5 in aerospace and a few in Management before I joined my current employer. 

I am interested in getting my BS in Computer Science or Software Development (That my current employer will pay for). I have a Masters degree in Leadership from a state college and a BS in business. I chose those majors because I hate math and know the two degrees I’m considering are going to have me get into Calc and all that not so fun stuff. 

The questions are:

Do you think that struggling for 2-3 years with the math will pay off as far as employment offers are concerned? I’d like to get an offer for more than I’m currently making so that I won’t skip a beat with my financial goals. 

Would staying in my current role and getting various certifications over the course of the next few years be better if it would get me to the $100k-$110k range? (Probably not making more than $120k-$130k over the next 10-15 years, that seems like the cap for my program)

So now, obviously, I'm back again to ask for more advice.

My down payment plus closing costs is going to be $130,700, and there's ""a month of rent back, which can probably be applied toward closing costs"" (agent's words), but I don't fully understand that and ""probably"" didn't really convince me, so I'm just going to pretend that money doesn't exist.  I currently have $132,000 in my checking account; we lived on $20,000 annual income from 2007 to 2015 then my income shot up to $100,000 and we didn't change our lifestyle, so we went from scraping by to a robust savings account pretty fast, and I'm pretty sure I can replace the savings by this time next year.

So here's the retirement fund situation: In 2007 I came into some money ($4,000) and early 2008 put it into a Roth IRA and bought Starbucks at $9/share, and I think I've made a couple contributions since then but I forget when or how much.  I would like to use the house as an excuse to pull as much out of retirement as possible to give myself some wiggle room (This is only about 6 months worth of expenses, but I'm not expecting my work situation to change, if it does I'll just go live homeless at the docks or under a bridge or something... LA has a lot of beautiful bridges).

So far I've spoken to my home loan agent, my next door neighbor (CPA), and my dad (landlord since about 1960), and all 3 of them seem to be disagreeing on whether or not my Roth IRA can be used toward my down payment on my house, and none of them seem to know what the actual steps are to getting it done.

My Roth IRA is currently in etrade, I am not sure exactly how much I've contributed and I haven't been able to find the breakdown on their website. I *think* my total cash contributions over the years were $8,000 and my profit on investments is $20,000.  From what I've read online, I should be able to take out $18,000 without penalty ($10,000 of the profit along with the $8,000 original contribution).  However, all 3 of the people I've spoken to tell me that I'm wrong; one of them tells me I can take out all $28,000 no problem, and one of them says it's a hard $10,000 limit.  Additionally, I can't figure out how to tell for sure the exact amount of my initial contribution and I'm worried that if it's, say, $6,000 instead of $8,000 like I remember, that I'll get hit with a bunch of penalties.

So that brings me into the ""steps"" for getting the cash out, and how exactly the penalty works for running over the limit (if there IS a limit, which the home loan agent insists there is not).  Is the penalty a flat fee or a percent?  What's the percent?  Do I just take the money out and then deal with it on my taxes or do I have to notify etrade ahead of time, and if so how does that process work?

edit: I'm 37 years old","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted here &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/beceed/im_37_wife_32_baby_is_2_112k_savings_and_20k_roth/""&gt;a couple months ago&lt;/a&gt; seeking advice on buying a house, and in a classic &amp;quot;me&amp;quot; move I totally disregarded everyone&amp;#39;s advice and signed a lease on a $616,000 house today with 20% down.  So now, obviously, I&amp;#39;m back again to ask for more advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My down payment plus closing costs is going to be $130,700, and there&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;a month of rent back, which can probably be applied toward closing costs&amp;quot; (agent&amp;#39;s words), but I don&amp;#39;t fully understand that and &amp;quot;probably&amp;quot; didn&amp;#39;t really convince me, so I&amp;#39;m just going to pretend that money doesn&amp;#39;t exist.  I currently have $132,000 in my checking account; we lived on $20,000 annual income from 2007 to 2015 then my income shot up to $100,000 and we didn&amp;#39;t change our lifestyle, so we went from scraping by to a robust savings account pretty fast, and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I can replace the savings by this time next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the retirement fund situation: In 2007 I came into some money ($4,000) and early 2008 put it into a Roth IRA and bought Starbucks at $9/share, and I think I&amp;#39;ve made a couple contributions since then but I forget when or how much.  I would like to use the house as an excuse to pull as much out of retirement as possible to give myself some wiggle room (This is only about 6 months worth of expenses, but I&amp;#39;m not expecting my work situation to change, if it does I&amp;#39;ll just go live homeless at the docks or under a bridge or something... LA has a lot of beautiful bridges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#39;ve spoken to my home loan agent, my next door neighbor (CPA), and my dad (landlord since about 1960), and all 3 of them seem to be disagreeing on whether or not my Roth IRA can be used toward my down payment on my house, and none of them seem to know what the actual steps are to getting it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Roth IRA is currently in etrade, I am not sure exactly how much I&amp;#39;ve contributed and I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find the breakdown on their website. I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; my total cash contributions over the years were $8,000 and my profit on investments is $20,000.

I will try to make a long story as short as I can. Have had a collection on my credit report for nearly 5 years from an apartment I lived at 7 years ago.

Several months later, after I was moved into a house, I received a collection notice for that previous rental property for erroneous moving-out expenses. Come to find the property was bought out just after I moved, and they were hitting up old tenants with the expenses of updating units. IE: New trim around door, painting front door, new dishwasher, new faucets etc. Ridiculous things. I originally tried to dispute charges with rental property, which lead nowhere, other than sending me to who bought the debt. Hunter Warfield.

Recently, this account got me denied for a condo. Which is the only reason why I am not waiting for it to fall off on its own.

I am currently looking to replace my wife’s car. It’s an older ‘06 American made vehicle, and rust has gotten the better of it. We’re looking to buy a 2-3 year old Honda or Subaru, and I plan on this being our only car loan until it’s paid off.

We’re currently shopping for the best deal on True Car, and hopefully find a vehicle nearby. We have another car loan for my vehicle with about $1500 left on it, but we may not be able to wait until it’s paid off to purchase her a replacement. I have a few questions that I need to consider, and any advice/ reasoning would be greatly appreciated!

1) Should I pay off my loan first so the banks see I have less owed or does this not make a difference? We have the money, but would prefer to make the next several payments rather than pay it off immediately if it has no impact on the next purchase.

2) Should I get prequalified for a loan first at a credit union, or do this at the car dealership?

Thank you all for the help!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello PF!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently looking to replace my wife’s car. It’s an older ‘06 American made vehicle, and rust has gotten the better of it. We’re looking to buy a 2-3 year old Honda or Subaru, and I plan on this being our only car loan until it’s paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re currently shopping for the best deal on True Car, and hopefully find a vehicle nearby. We have another car loan for my vehicle with about $1500 left on it, but we may not be able to wait until it’s paid off to purchase her a replacement. I have a few questions that I need to consider, and any advice/ reasoning would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Should I pay off my loan first so the banks see I have less owed or does this not make a difference? We have the money, but would prefer to make the next several payments rather than pay it off immediately if it has no impact on the next purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Should I get prequalified for a loan first at a credit union, or do this at the car dealership?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Any experience with True Car? They seem like a good source of info. I’ve also been looking into Carvana. Some people seem to love it, others have had bad experiences. Either way I just want to get the best deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) What are the perks to buying at a local dealership as opposed to one further away? I don’t mind traveling 50-100 miles to get the right deal if it’s a one time thing. &lt;/p&gt;

For the past 6 years I’ve worked seasonal seafood jobs to supplement my income. I love the work, but it doesn’t pay enough to live off of so I live with my mom during my time off (about 3 months). I usually pick up a serving job or something. 

She’s not expected to live much longer. She owns a crappy car and a house that is valued around $200,000. If sold, the money would be split with my uncle who is our only other living relative. No life insurance policy and under $1000 in her bank account. Also has 5 cats that I don’t think I’ll be able to take care of.

I currently don’t pay rent. I pay for utilities and such, but have never had to budget for the real world. I don’t own a car. I don’t have insurance. I have maybe $700 to my name at the moment. 

Sorry if this post is all over or in the wrong place. I’m not sure what to do with the kind of money I would receive from selling the house and I don’t know what to budget for when people die? Loose ends, etc. I think I’m just super overwhelmed right now.

***Edit/Update:

Thank you all so much for genuinely good information and being so kind.  I’m for sure going to look into trade schools. To answer some questions: I have my GED, and no debt at all (which is nice.) My mother has aggressive stomach cancer and she lives in Florida. Home is entirely under her name legally and she wants to do the right thing by giving my uncle what he was entitled to when my grandparents passed.

As to how I have no savings: I’ve been doing work travel programs for years and it’s never allowed me to save money or have my own shit. I’m actually currently in Alaska working at a fish processing plant. Health issues have kept me out of the military and also from hopping on a fishing boat unfortunately.

Also am a v single lady with no significant other or siblings and few friends who also lead the same work/travel/repeat lifestyle.  I’ve done mostly factory and fish work for a while, but I’ve worked all over the US at summer camps, farms, hostels and national parks. Some jobs pay well, but most pay trash and offer room and board instead.

I have never made a budget before. I came close a few times, but I have some mental blocks regarding it. I have a rough idea of what I spend. I make ~$3600 a month(70k/yr), paid every other week. I spend $740/mo on rent and between $40-80/mo on my phone plan.

I have nearly $17,000, broken up across different accounts (skip to after the dot if you don't care how it's broken up)

$4500 in an investments account, half of that actually invested. The rest I pulled from BYND when it was double what I invested. 

$3000 in a savings account I'd like to keep for emergencies.

$5000 in a checking account doing nothing, but I'll be paying my rent by check so I'll always need $2500 at the start of each month, before my roommates reimburse me. (I'm working on this, I'll try to get paid before the rent is due).

I've got another $4000 in checks I'll finally be cashing this weekend, and ~$5000? in bonds from gifts when I was born.

I'm looking at a new car for about $14,000, I might go up to $20,000 and pay it off in installments. My mom says that would help my credit. She also wants to co-sign if it helps lower the interest rate since that will help my credit. Is co-signing something I should be wary of for my credit? I'll definitely pay off whatever I spend on time. 

I also want to go abroad for my masters degree, in 2-3 years time or so. And that makes me hesitant to buy a car, especially if I want to stay out there for 3+ years.

I appreciate any and all advice. I won't be actively redponding since I'm driving several states away after I post this, but I'll be sure to read everything when I get there.

&lt;p&gt;I have never made a budget before. I came close a few times, but I have some mental blocks regarding it. I have a rough idea of what I spend. I make ~$3600 a month(70k/yr), paid every other week. I spend $740/mo on rent and between $40-80/mo on my phone plan.&lt;/p&gt;

No dependents and plan on staying that way. Old throwaway because my primary account is probably identifiable by some friends or family that might see this.


I've lurked here and r/financialindependence plenty, but generally feel out of my depth and uninterested in the ""active management"" approach. The lazier the better, as in everything.


Having changed careers (less than $30k/yr) into something that pays quite a bit more (now at $80k/yr) a couple of years ago and not feeling like I have as much to show for it financially as I should, I've been pondering paying a financial advisor for some help. I'm worried that if I pay someone $1500 right now, I'm just going to end up with a budget that I could have created on my own and $1500 less towards savings or investments.


I have 2 distinct short-er term goals:

* within 2 years, buy and outfit a van for living/adventuring. I realize that my living situation could change due to SO situation or whatnot in the meantime, but I like to go camping and hiking and adventuring a lot and this would enable that further, making me happier (the most important part!). And if that situation doesn't ariae, I have a much cheaper housing situation that would prepare me for the next part. I want to do this right, and expect the whole thing to cost in the neighborhood of $60k all said and done.

* partial retirement by 40. Looking to only need to pick up contracting or consulting work a couple days a week, and would expect an absolute minimum of $50/hr. I want to bump around the country going to national parks and exploring, then come back to WiFi or whatever and make enough to subsist that lifestyle on while whatever investments I have continue to grow. Timeframe would be somewhat flexible but I'm not working full time past 45 without being drug kicking and screaming.


Long term goal of continuing that lifestyle, willing to keep piddling with contracting or whatnot for a while, hard to particularly say now since that's so far in the future.


I have some assets and debt, but nothing spectacular.


Assets

* A little over $10k in high yield savings (ally), a couple thousand in my bank's lower yield (summer is expensive, I've been reluctant to move it all over and have to wait if I decide to do something. In winter my spending goes way down and it will all go to ally)

* a 401k that I'm not great at tracking the value of but is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $3k (I didn't enroll myself for too long, dumb move)

* $500 in wealthfront. Just getting started here.

* HSA with a couple thousand in it. 


Debt

* $5k left on a car loan, paying $270/mo right now

* $1300 in student loans. Making $350/mo payments so that's gone in a couple months, then divert most or all of that to the car

* Both of these are paying almost entirely principal, I'm accruing less than 2% interest total even if I don't shift the payments


My monthly bills (rent, insurance, phone, streaming services, etc) come out to about $1900/mo, and my take home is right at $5000/mo. I put $700/Mo in savings automatically, and try to put another ~$500 in each month.


I don't really feel like I need a financial advisor, since most of the cases I see if that are people that are in some horrible debt or tax situation and Im (thankfully, for the first time in my life) not. But I think the peace of mind of having it all figured out for me might be worth it. That said if it's just going to be a budget and pump more money into savings accounts and investments I don't want to waste my money. Though, also due to my huge pay increase I feel like I've let some lifestyle creep get me and now I'm not sure what kind of budget is reasonable, especially because I don't really ""have"" to. I can just go out and eat if I want, I have plenty of money. That's proving to be problematic for an aggressive savings plan.


Any recommendations, based on my story? Assuming they're well regarded and certified and not crazy expensive for my area, is a financial advisor...advisable?

2) How do we let the things mature without breaking them up? (Were not close but I think could agree on a trustee?)

The car should be paid off in 1-2 months time opening up another $237 approx left over.

&lt;p&gt;After all expenses, I have about $800-1000 leftover. Should I continue to build up my emergency fund to fully fund emergency fund or aggressively pay off the student loans or car loan? &lt;/p&gt;

My first question is why is it advised to split your emergency fund like that? Your emergency fund is for emergencies, so wouldn't you want it all in one place for quick and easy access in the case of an emergency? Is it because Roth offers more interest, followed by savings, followed by checking, but withdrawing money from those accounts also has a higher cost descending in that order? So tiering it offers the most money gain in the end assuming that you’ll never encounter an emergency where you’re required to dip into your Roth? Also, when an emergency occurs, how should you go about using the money if it's tiered? Clear your checking, then move to savings, then move to your retirement fund (that's what a Roth IRA is, right?)? Finally, in the comment he talks about I-bonds and VSCGX, which look like investments to me if I’m understanding this correctly. But on the wiki page, it says you shouldn’t invest your emergency funds, so either I don’t understand what I-bonds and VSCGX are (if that’s the case, please help me understand) or there are conflicting views on whether or not you should invest your emergency funds, in which case it comes down to preference?  
    
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Making a savings account**  
A retirement account is a form of a savings account, correct? Am I supposed to have a savings account (like at the local bank) as well as a retirement account? Would the only purpose of it be to hold emergency funds of about 50% of it if I tier my emergency funds? In that case, the most important factor in choosing a savings account would be accessibility, since you likely won’t have a balance big enough for the small interest difference between banks to matter much?  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Making a retirement account**  
Due to the overseas earned income exclusion, it looks like I’m not eligible to open an IRA, Roth, or 401k. I do however, get pension upon leaving the country, the first of which I used to take down my student loan. To clarify, I move countries/employers every few years. What are my options for building a retirement fund? Should I just stick to a typical savings account? Investopedia says brokerage accounts are one alternative. However, it also says that firms that offer guidance and counseling (which I will probably need since I’m so lost in the economic world) usually have a hefty fee. Should I just invest (I-bonds and CDs?) the money that I would have otherwise put into a retirement account? 
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Investing**  
For I-bonds, I basically give them money, they hold it for a maximum of 30 years, and then they give me my money back plus interest? It’s that simple? I see that you can buy a maximum of $10k I-bonds per year. If I spend $10k over 2 years, do I have 2 I-bonds worth $10k, or one I-bond worth $20k? Is it advisable to buy I-bonds every year in this fashion? Is I-bond a company product or its own entity? As in, do different companies offer different I-bond rates, or is I-bond its own thing and every I-bond will be treated equally?  
For CDs, does every big bank offer them? If so, I’m assuming each bank has different rates, correct? And to make sure I understand the concept correctly, the basic principal is like this:  
- If I invest $5, they give me $1 each month.  
- I invest $25 ($5x5). This nets me $5.  
- I add the new $5 to my original investment (now $30).  
- This nets me $6 the next month.  
And this continues for as long as you’d like. Adding your earnings to your base investment to further increase your earnings is where the “ladder” comes from, correct?  
For now, I’m only interested in safe long-term investments as I want to get all my chicks in a row before trying to learn aggressive investing. Is this a good way to go about it? Or should I start trying to learn how to do that as soon as possible?

Thank you so much to anyone who has read this far.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty much debt free (I&amp;#39;ve gotten down to less than $1,000 left in student loans and have 5 years to pay it off) and so I&amp;#39;m looking to start preparing money for retirement. After reading the wiki, my understanding is I should use my money in this order:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an emergency account&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a savings account&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a retirement account&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have absolutely no background on finance, so all of the terms and different types of accounts and things confuses me a lot. I have questions about each of these areas and hoping someone will be kind enough to help me understand. &lt;/p&gt;

I recently took a job opportunity in Philadelphia for a 40% pay increase raising me and my wife's average combined income to 100k/yr. My home is in the suburbs 2 hours away and for the last 2 months I have been commuting 2 hours to work, working 8 hours, then commuting 2 hours home. It's starting to wear me down and I am trying to determine if it would make more financial sense to rent a room in the city during the work week? Job opportunities closer to where we live are far and few between and relocating is not an option. Weighing all opportunity costs,  I am also not keen on job hopping anytime soon as my industry/company in particular will be the fastest way to reach a 6 figure income and clean up all of our debt. 

Net Income: $5,700-6,000/mo

Expenses: \~$4,200/mo

Total Debt:

180k mortgage

50k student loans

10k car note

5k credit card debt

Budget:

$1500 mortgage

$204 train ticket

$500 gas

$200 utilities 

$200 student loans

$236 car payment

$162 car insurance

$300 credit card payments

$300 food

$400 misc.

$150 pets

$100 health insurance

&amp;#x200B;

I commute 100 miles a day, 4-5 days a week spending \~$60-90/week on gas, averages around to $300/mo for my car alone.

Then $205/mo for a train ticket into the city from the station. So my total commuting cost is $505/mo not counting wear and tear on my car/oil changes.

If I were to live in the city during the week, my wife and I would trade in both of our cars for one car, eliminating my $236/mo car payment. She would drop me to and from the station at the beginning and end of the week and use the car all week as I wouldn't need it in the city. As I would only need to rent from Mon-Thurs night and would be home Fri-Sun, I could feasibly find a room for $400-450/mo with utilities included. A monthly train pass within city/adjacent suburb limits is $175/mo on top of rent. My cost to stay in the city would be $600-$650/mo.

From a purely financial perspective, would it make more sense to continue commuting, or staying in the city during the work week? Please let me know.

We are currently registered as domestic partners, and I'm questioning whether marriage would be financially beneficial for us.

Basically I'm trying to create and Excel sheet that compares what our total take home pay will be in three scenarios: unmarried, married filing separate, or married filing jointly. Every time I search for an answer regarding one factor, I learn about something else I hadn't considered or didn't know about.

So, the factors I need to account for that I have identified are:

* If we are unmarried he can claim head of household
* If we are married filing joint taxes, my student loan payment will skyrocket
* If we are married filing separate my student loan payment will not change, but I won't be able to claim the interest deduction on my taxes
* If he claims head of household, he will be claiming the baby on his taxes. Does this mean he can also claim the child tax credit? How does this work? 
* If I claim the baby, my ""discretionary income"" will go down, so my student loan payment will go down (I think this is negligible compared to the benefits of him claiming head of household). 

&amp;#x200B;

What factors am I missing that will affect our take home pay? So far, it looks to me like the best option is to not get married, and have him claim the baby. However, I don't want to start crunching the numbers again until I know for sure I'm accounting for all the factors and haven't overlooked something. So far I have also not found a single beneficial thing that marriage will accomplish that can't also be accomplished another way without marriage. I know, I sound really romantic right now... Are there any other reasons that marriage might be a better option for us?

Background Info: 

Before taxes and deductions, he makes $80,000 annually, I make $61,000. I intend to stay full time at my job and just take my parental leave before returning to work. I don't expect either of us to have a loss in income. I have a large student loan debt, and am currently on the income based repayment plan (I pay 10% of my discretionary income towards loans annually). I qualify for public service loan forgiveness. We both have decent health insurance, but with our company's HSA contributions it is cheaper (even if we hit the maximum out of pocket) to each use our own insurance, not have both of us on one person's insurance. That means as long as we keep the same jobs, Imputed Income is not an issue if we don't get married (we've gone through this before with him on my insurance). It will be cheaper if the baby goes on my insurance. I also have a major medical condition that causes me to usually hit my maximum out of pocket, so I always make sure I contribute enough to have that amount in my HSA account. Having a dependent (baby) on my insurance would mean my company would double their HSA contribution, meaning I wouldn't have to contribute any more to my HSA than I already am to still have enough to cover the higher maximum out of pocket with a dependent. 

He owns the townhouse we live in. The plan would be to put me on the deed prior to baby being born. I don't know if this is a factor or not, but my understanding is that if he claims head of household he must pay majority of the household bills.

I think I've learned an invaluable lesson from visiting this sub reddit which is overcoming my fears of the credit card.  I've been listening a bit to Dave Ramsey (haven't read his books yet but I'm getting much out of his youtube videos and web content).  From what I gather, he's very anti-credit card.  Cut up your cards and budget yourself with cash.  There's also a perception that debt is bad and that you shouldn't have any.  I think there have been quite a few voices in my life that have echoed that same concern (fear) with credit cards and so I've always been cautious about that.  In fact, it wasn't until about 6 years ago that I actually got a credit card for the first time (I'm 40).

I started visiting this sub reddit and listening to other audiobooks like Rich Dad Poor Dad to gain more insight into personal finance/wealth accumulation and I'm coming to a different conclusion that is counter-intuitive to what's typically taught.  Here are my lessons which break conventional wisdom:

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 - Increase your credit limit.  Increasing your limit is a good thing because if you're financially responsible (you don't spend more as a result of the increase) and pay your card(s) off every month, you decrease your credit usage which will help your credit score.  The key is to always stay under 30% usage so that your credit score can increase/stay high.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2 - Use your credit card for everything.  This is fairly obvious - by using your credit card in place of a debit or check card, you're accruing points at a much faster rate which, if you're smart, can be redeemed for cash for further investing.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 - Get your money out of a traditional bank.  Banks are pretty horrible about paying you back for the privilege of using your money to make a profit for themselves.  Assuming your risk tolerance is agreeable to this, you can take that money and buy into a  money market mutual fund through a brokerage's cash management account and make quite a bit more than a traditional bank would dole out.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking these lessons together, you can actually EARN MORE MONEY by using your credit card for everything,  Not only are you generating points which can be converted to cash from all the credit card spending, but the money you would've used for day-day purchases can instead sit in a high yield investment for that month prior to being use to pay off the balance.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me back to Dave Ramsey. His contention is that if you have a credit card, you're likely to spend way more because you're not limited by the cash you have on-hand.  Yes, that's possible BUT if you realize you have to pay that money off in a month and keep an eye on what you're spending through that month, this shouldn't be a problem.  I think Dave is doing a disservice to many people who are financially responsible because the money that can be generated using the lessons above can be pretty significant.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, this is entirely based on the premise that you are a debt-free or at least debt-controlled human being. I wouldn't recommend this strategy if you struggle with debt or are loose with your spending and don't pay your bills on time.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I'm not thinking of everything so I'd be interested to hear your views, thoughts, experiences or other lessons that you've come across.  If you disagree with my lessons, share that as well.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge disclaimer:  I never have an overdue  balance on my credit card, I pay the whole thing off every month. In fact, I&amp;#39;ve never paid interest on credit card debt that I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve learned an invaluable lesson from visiting this sub reddit which is overcoming my fears of the credit card.  I&amp;#39;ve been listening a bit to Dave Ramsey (haven&amp;#39;t read his books yet but I&amp;#39;m getting much out of his youtube videos and web content).  From what I gather, he&amp;#39;s very anti-credit card.  Cut up your cards and budget yourself with cash.  There&amp;#39;s also a perception that debt is bad and that you shouldn&amp;#39;t have any.  I think there have been quite a few voices in my life that have echoed that same concern (fear) with credit cards and so I&amp;#39;ve always been cautious about that.  In fact, it wasn&amp;#39;t until about 6 years ago that I actually got a credit card for the first time (I&amp;#39;m 40).&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to lay out where I'm at currently and some aspirations I have in the next few years and see if this is a feasible option financially. I am 21 years old and graduated university last December. I have a little less than a month's worth of expenses in savings ($800). Thankfully I have a decent job, live in a small town, and have cheap rent with roommates, meaning I can save quite a bit while I am here. My monthly income is around $1150, and with only about $850-900 in expenses, meaning even if I overspend a bit here and there I can reasonably put $200 per month into savings. I also have been receiving back child support payments from my ever-absent father (which recently have been about $50 a week,  but formerly had been as much as $60-70) but I have no basis for how much left/longer he has to pay on that or how consistently I will get it, so I just put it into savings and don't count it as part of my income for budgeting purposes. Thankfully my student loans only total just under $10,000 so that monthly payment is very manageable, and I have been considering adding more than the minimum payment to get that out of the way a little faster (especially as I currently get more income than expected per month with child support payments).  


Here is the catch: I don't want to stay here forever. In college I did a semester abroad in South America and loved it; I had traveled before and I have known for years that I want to live abroad. I am very interested in teaching English potentially and I have been furiously researching and reading r/TEFL, as well as watching videos and reading info from people who are experts in the area (Ben Teaches English Abroad is one that comes to mind). Looking at potential routes and job placements, I think the earliest I would possibly go is February/March 2020. I am hoping that I can increase my savings base to at least $2500 or more by that time. Even if I had to wait until a few months later, I could build a bigger savings and be more comfortable before I go. I feel like I would be doing well to have enough in a US account to cover my student loan payments for the year, as well as airfare and at least a month of (US rate) expenses should an emergency happen that requires me to head home early.   


I know that the big bucks/salaries are in Asia, but my heart is in South America and that's really where I'd like to go. Looking at some potential contracts, I think I could save $100-200 per month in most places that I may go. (Income is much lower, but cost of living is also much lower). If I decide that I like that job/career path, I can keep up with it, keep travelling, keep building my savings and paying off my loans, and potentially move into countries/roles that would pay me more and allow me to be more comfortable financially. Even if I come home not planning to return to that field, I feel like I would be OK as I would have that savings to fall back on and I could begin in a different direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've just recently in the past few months started looking at my financial future and looking at my options to invest. At the moment I've just been looking at less-risk options like high-interest savings accounts, CD accounts, and possibly even index funds.

My current finances are:

$19k in a checking account

$5k in cash

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated college with no debt, having attended a four-year university while commuting from home, and we're low-income so state/federal financial aid grants covered all my expenses. I've also been able to save \~85% of my earnings at my current job due to it being reasonably high-paying ($28+/hour after factoring in taxes and tips).

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the thing: my first post-grad job is a 6 month temporary (but possibly permanent) assignment in Hawaii that starts in a few weeks. My rent is $1000/month, and beyond just leisurely expenses and rent, I don't expect to be spending much beyond that. Pay is $22.12/hour, 40+ hours a week. I'm also receiving a lump sum relocation expenses payment of $1500, as well as a $2500 signing bonus. Within four years, if all goes well I expect to earn \~$70-80k salary/year. I also plan on living at my parent's home for at least another 5 years, if my work permits me to stay local.

&amp;#x200B;

My current short/long term financial goals are to save enough money for a 30-40% down payment on a house within 10 years to afford a two bedroom, 1 or 2 bathroom house/condo somewhere in Southern California (I'm currently based near downtown LA). With the two bedroom unit, I also plan on renting out the extra bedroom to help cover mortgage costs. My monkey brain also tells me to want to buy a decent two-door ""sports car"", as I do consider myself an automotive enthusiast and enjoy those kinds of things. Obviously making a $20-30k purchase on a depreciating asset is by far not the best decision to make right after college.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you all have any general advice for me? Are my financial goals a bit too far-reaching? What would you suggest to me, a complete novice when it comes to making investments? Should I stick to low-risk investments for now, and then possibly down the road get into more high-risk options? What resources would you suggest I look into?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

I also plan on living at my parent&amp;#39;s home for at least another 5 years, if my work permits me to stay local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current short/long term financial goals are to save enough money for a 30-40% down payment on a house within 10 years to afford a two bedroom, 1 or 2 bathroom house/condo somewhere in Southern California (I&amp;#39;m currently based near downtown LA). With the two bedroom unit, I also plan on renting out the extra bedroom to help cover mortgage costs. My monkey brain also tells me to want to buy a decent two-door &amp;quot;sports car&amp;quot;, as I do consider myself an automotive enthusiast and enjoy those kinds of things. Obviously making a $20-30k purchase on a depreciating asset is by far not the best decision to make right after college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you all have any general advice for me? Are my financial goals a bit too far-reaching? What would you suggest to me, a complete novice when it comes to making investments? Should I stick to low-risk investments for now, and then possibly down the road get into more high-risk options? What resources would you suggest I look into?&lt;/p&gt;

Been applying to jobs the past few weeks and the interviews are starting to snowball in and I'm having trouble finding time to commit. I'll get that sorted out but need advice on how to handle offers.

&amp;#x200B;

I received a highly competitive offer from Company A. Benefits are great (11% match). It's also a non-profit so my student loans will continue to be enrolled in the PSLF program. 17 days of PTO. Low deductible healthcare plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Company B is a tech company, I have a in-person interview late next week. I believe their offer will be slightly higher (\~5-10k), healthcare 100% paid for, 4% match, unlimited PTO but a for-profit company which means my student loans will not be forgiven.

&amp;#x200B;

Company C is also a tech company. I am the final and only candidate I believe. I will be receiving an offer but they are relatively young and almost too close to being a startup. (50 employees, series B funding in 2017). I expect the compensation to be close to company A.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 40k in student loans with 7 years left until forgiveness.

I'd say company B is much more on the forefront of technologies and available tools for my career.

&amp;#x200B;

**I think I should lean towards Company A but I need advice on how to handle if/when the offer letters come in from B and C? Should I further negotiate if the pay is any different? Also how long can I hold off on signing an offer letter if I have already received it and should I be upfront about my situation?**

&amp;#x200B;

Again all companies will most likely be in line with their offer. I expect company B to be the highest but probably 5-10k at most higher.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

Hey all, would appreciate your insight into my  scenario: my colleague who basically does the same job as me left and  I've been stuck doing all of her work as they haven't hired anyone to  replace her (this has been about 4 months now). They are notorious for  not hiring people so I'm almost 100% sure they aren't going to hire  another person to help me out. My work also never has yearly reviews and  never gives raises unless asked and even then they just give inflation  based raises. So how much do you think I should ask for a raise? I mean  they are saving like $50,000  by not hiring someone else so I'd like to  ask for a $20,000 raise but I doubt that's likely after reading may of  the posts on here.

So, to start off I'm not absolving my Dad of blame for any of this and neither is he. He takes full responsibility of his actions. We just need help given the circumstances.

To explain further, my dad is a pediatrician in an underserved inner-city community for 35 years. He loves what he does and he loves his community. My mother works with him as manager of his private clinic for the last 10 years. She has no medical or manager background but mainly has been helping him as consistent work was hard to come by. Through some over sight of her and the billing company, several years back they erroneously used medicaid allotted vaccines for private insurance pts (which is a fraction of his patient population). This was uncovered during an audit this year and totaled in roughly 60k in fines which he is absolutely willing to pay. He has accepted the blame because ultimately this falls on him and is accepting the charge which amounts to a felony. He has now been stripped of his license and his clinic is now closed. He is devastated to say the least.

On June 21st he received a letter from Merrill Lynch stating they no longer will be custodians of his retirement account and if he can't find someone to take it on, it will be liquidated to him with taxes taken out. We are assuming this is because he accepted the charges. We've contacted several other firms including Edward Jones who state the same thing that they are not willing to take on his account. What would be the best course of action for his retirement? Are there some specific smaller firms that have experience in this that are able to help?

In most cases, I will be using the train to get to work, especially if I will only be going to my office. 

I currently have a Honda that I purchased about a year ago for well below its blue book value (~5k).

I am a little hesitant on if I should sell it mainly because it's a reliable car in great shape.

In a few months I want to trade up to a Hyundai veloster N, this car costs 29,000 before TTR. I put away 1 out of every 2 paychecks I get every month into a charles schwab money market account I use as a ""big boi expense"" account. Money for moving out, new car etc.

I currently have 11k saved and have not touched it since I created it in February. I realize if I buy this car I would have to live at home a bit longer than I originally planned just to save up again.

the plan is to put down around 10k for a down payment, and finance the rest over 60 months. my credit is great, believe its over 760, so getting a low APR isnt going to be an issue.

I realize I should be buying used, but the car is new and there isnt any used ones for sale yet.

Any advice is greatly appreciated! 



Current breakdown (roughly $165k)

-Schwab Checking: $2k. (fluctuates between 2-5k throughout the month) 

-American Express HY Savings: $17k (about $4k of this is earmarked for vacation/car insurance/other big semiplanned expenses for the year)

-New Employer traditional 401k: $2k and growing

-401K still in Fidelity from former employer: $43k (Roth:$23k / Traditional: $20k)

-Vanguard Investments:

Personal Investments: $48k

Roth IRA (employer rollover + last year max contribution +$4k YTD): $22k

Rollover IRA: $30k




Investment Strategy :

1. Maxing out 401k contributions for the year (traditional 401k is my only option): $19k; employer matches 4% fully vested this year, increase to 7% after 1 year of employment (the next 3% vests over 5 years... May not stay that long) 

2. Max out IRA contribution ($6k)

3. $2250 into HSA + employer match $750=$3k total

4. Transfer $1500 from checking into savings each month ($18k total for year— note that I just increased this with the new job, used to be $750/month)

4a. I usually let my savings grow to $18k or so and then move cash to Vanguard investments to bring savings down to $12k and then let it grow again.

5. Vanguard personal investments are split between ~10 ETFs, 3 mutual funds, the IRAs are almost solely VTSAX/VTI.

6. If I earn 26 paychecks per year, 2 per month go to expenses + savings contributions and the extra 2 at the end of the year plus any bonus are my vacation/large semiplanned expense fund for the calendar year. 


I earn $102k gross annually (just recently increased from $90k with a new job), and take home $2.2k per biweekly paycheck. 


I pay $1450 per month for a 1 bedroom apartment (this is well below market value for my area as my landlord is 90 and just wants someone living here), $80 for utilities/internet. After taking out savings, all other cash goes food/entertainment/gym/gas for the month ($1500). I own my car (5 year old Accord with 60k miles). 



Finally the question:

I live in an expensive area of NJ (Bergen county) and don't really want to give it up (40 minutes bus ride to Manhattan, hour drive to work), so I'm starting to think about buying a condo /co-op, rather than throwing money into rent each month.

How should I change my savings strategy to account for this?

Putting money into investments is great for interest growth, but getting the money back out may be costly for tax purposes?

I don't want to own something that requires too much maintenance, but then a lot of HOA fees around here are $1000+ —at that rate it almost makes me feel like renting is better?? (if something breaks I don't pay)

&lt;p&gt;I pay $1450 per month for a 1 bedroom apartment (this is well below market value for my area as my landlord is 90 and just wants someone living here), $80 for utilities/internet. After taking out savings, all other cash goes food/entertainment/gym/gas for the month ($1500). I own my car (5 year old Accord with 60k miles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in an expensive area of NJ (Bergen county) and don&amp;#39;t really want to give it up (40 minutes bus ride to Manhattan, hour drive to work), so I&amp;#39;m starting to think about buying a condo /co-op, rather than throwing money into rent each month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How should I change my savings strategy to account for this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting money into investments is great for interest growth, but getting the money back out may be costly for tax purposes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to own something that requires too much maintenance, but then a lot of HOA fees around here are $1000+ —at that rate it almost makes me feel like renting is better?? (if something breaks I don&amp;#39;t pay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for any advice!&lt;/p&gt;

For years, I've held the following mix of cards to try and maximize cash back rewards:

* Discover It (5% categories)
* Chase Freedom (5% categories)
* AMEX Everyday Blue Cash (3% groceries, 2% gas)
* Citi Double Cash (2% on everything)

Every quarter, I write up a cards to put in my wallet and my wife's billfold relating which is the optimal card to use for various types of expenses that quarter.

However, we've reached a point where it feels like we need to simplify.  I'm considering going down to just one personal card, and one card for our small business.  Both cards would need to be Visa due to our frequenting of Costco, which only accepts Visa.

&amp;#x200B;

The small business card feels simple - there's the Captial One Spark Business card, which is a Visa and gets 2% on everything.

The personal card feels a little more complicated.  I'm considering going with the Chase Freedom Unlimited, at least for a year, as it gets 3% on everything for the first year, and then reevaluating as that year runs out.  I haven't done the math on how much we'd need to spend to make that 3% bonus rate more advantageous than other enrollment period bonuses  out there (like $150 for $500 spent in 1st 3 months on Quicksilver, etc.).

One of the credit cards I have is a 'cash rewards' so is it possible to make payments with the cash rewards card and then pay it off immediately and still receive the rewards?  Or would it just be better to just pay straight from my checkings/savings account?

I am trying to raise my score as quickly as possible so would you guys recommend getting another credit card to purely lower the utilization percentage?  &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of context. I'm a 22yo living with his parents. I'm in Business School, specializing in Entrepreneurship on the weekends. I just got a new job (internship) that pays almost 3x what I was making before, but it's also further away from where I live and study, so I'll have around 2:30 to 3h in public transport everyday, compared to the 20 min I had before. That means I have little to no free time during the week, and part of the weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

I own a car that my father gave to me. I love it, but I sometimes feel it's a little too much for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to use my car everyday. With this new job, I don't think I'll be able to use my car during the week, so it would be basically a weekend car only. We only have one parking spot where we live, so we're currently paying a decent sum of money for a parking spot a couple of blocks away, so it's expensive and a pain to walk there everytime I have to use my car.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my father pays for all the costs of the car. He's not exactly complaining, but I'm sure he would be grateful if I reduced a few of those costs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a serious internal debate now. Having a car gives me the freedom to go anywhere I want with little trouble, and I might still use my car for work once in a while. But having an ""expensive"" car with little use feels a bit like a waste to me.

&amp;#x200B;

As a reference, my car is worth around R$ 53.000 on the used market (\~US$ 15.000, or around 53 minimum wages here). I could sell my car, Uber around when needed and invest the money (even to purchase another car when I feel the need to have one). Or I could sell my car and purchase a cheaper, smaller one that I could leave parked on the street. Or maybe just keep it, since my father is willing to cover the costs of maintaining the car?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone faced a similar situation, selling their car due to not being able to use it enough? I really enjoy driving, so that's kind of a big factor for me as well :(

I have the opposite problem to what many people seem to have, which is that I took a pretty well paying job in a rural area (about 40 minutes to an hour outside of my country’s capital city), and moved with my husband into a tiny studio apartment in the local community (there weren’t many housing options). My commute to work is only about 10-15 minutes by bus.

However, after 1 year at this job, this new set up has really been taking a toll on my mental health and quality of life. I work in a specific area of healthcare, which is particularly draining both emotionally and physically, with long and sporadically planned working hours. Because I am living in a more rural community, there are also very few activities and things to do, and few people in my age group (I am 26F). Our friends and family all live in the city, and we don’t have space in our studio apartment to host social gatherings. My husband and I feel very cramped and isolated, and I basically just spend all my time shuffling between my job and my tiny apartment. I take the train into the city about two to three times per month just to try and escape and do something fun. My husband is a masters student at the city’s university (good career prospects but, no income for the next 10 months). He has a long commute but his schedule is a lot more relaxed, so overall he tolerates it well.

So my question is, should we move back to the city? This would mean not only a longer commute to work for me (40 minutes to an hour) but also paying more than double what I currently pay in rent.

If it helps, here is a more detailed description of our budget converted to USD:

*side note: I am living in a Northern European country where my taxes pays for my healthcare and a quite decent pension plan

Income after all taxes, per month: about $3700-4000
 
Expenses for 2 people, per month:

-rent: about $700 all inclusive (considering 1-2 bedroom apartments in the city for $1500-1800)

-food: $215

-transport: $60 (would be $120 after a move to the city)

-phone: $40

-subscriptions: $20 (Netflix, HBO Nordic)

-misc. (fun days, dates, activities, birthday gifts, clothes): max $150

Savings: $21,000. I currently add around $2000 to this every month.

1. Save up all my money and buy a starter house this winter to get some equity, either through conventional  loan or a HFA loan matched to a conventional rate if I get pre approved 

2. Live with the parents for one more year and increase my savings to around 60-70k, while also investing into a ROTH IRA and maxing that out this year and next.

This is problematic in regards to personal information discretion, but my issue is:

I realized I'm being significantly underpaid in comparison to others who do the same work as me. 

I feel frustrated and upset about that fact. Not sure how to approach from here. 

How would you approach the situation?

**EDIT 1:** Thanks for all the answers. There are many good ones in-between! 

There are also a few that clearly want to see the world burn 😅

I had never expected this many replies, so please don't hold it against me for not answering each one of you.

First off. Again, thank you to all of you, who pitched in with your personal experiences, hardships, concerns, and advice. I have read through most of all ~2000 of them 😅

I have chosen to simply delete and bury the faulty email, and I will add a bit about being careful to not forward email-chains in our security newsletter this month instead. This way it will benefit everyone in the company to be wary of forwarding email-chains. The WHOLE chain will be forwarded.

Happy Independence Day Americans, happy Thursday everyone else.

My siblings and I want to buy a house for our mother and need ideas on how best to make sure we each get back what we paid, or pay into all expenses evenly.

The house we want to buy will ideally be in MA or southern NH. I live in PA, but for reasons, I'll be the one taking the loan. (unless there's a better reason not to? I have a house already with my wife, we together used FHA. one sibling has a house, too, and the other doesn't and doesn't want to use up her chance to use FHA).

I will have a hard time proving to a bank that I can afford the house, but our plan is to take conservatorship of my mom (to which she has agreed, we just have to go through the process), charge her rent, and pay the rest of the house costs ourselves split 3 ways.

So if you've done this or something similar before, I'd appreciate ideas. If you can think of something I haven't thought of, let's discuss it.

Trying to get an idea of these things:

1) does a written, signed agreement suffice in making sure that people pay their shares of things? (I'm picturing something like: ""I will pay 1/3 of all costs. When we no longer need the house, I will receive 1/3 of the value. If someone wants to keep the house, they can pay me out."")

2) how do we prove to a bank we can afford this? my household income is $150k and my siblings' are both higher, but it might be easier from a documentation sense to not tell the bank about my siblings?

2a) is there a legal entity we can create that could own the house, and let that entity charge us for the house expenses?

3) are we muddying the waters by being her conservator and landlord? if it's ""reasonable"" rent, are we in the clear?

thank you all!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

When we no longer need the house, I will receive 1/3 of the value. If someone wants to keep the house, they can pay me out.&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) how do we prove to a bank we can afford this? my household income is $150k and my siblings&amp;#39; are both higher, but it might be easier from a documentation sense to not tell the bank about my siblings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2a) is there a legal entity we can create that could own the house, and let that entity charge us for the house expenses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) are we muddying the waters by being her conservator and landlord? if it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;reasonable&amp;quot; rent, are we in the clear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thank you all!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently 28yo and just finished medical school and moving onto residency. I'm making about 63k/yr and am deciding between keeping my life insurance policies and taking over them or just cancelling to get term life.


So I currently have 3 policies all from NY Life but to simplify things, I have a total of $500,627 in death benefit, my monthly premium is $349 and current cash value sits at $22,000. 


If I understand things correctly, I'm paying $4,188 in annual premiums and historically the insurance company has paid around 6% dividend, so I can expect to hopefully get around $1320 in dividends? (22k \* .06) . Currently my dividends are set to paid up additions, which I believe means the dividends are used to purchase more death benefit and cash value. If I were to keep these policies, I'm thinking of maybe switching to have dividends pay the premiums. If I continue to pay for the policies, would I eventually grow enough cash value that the dividends can cover all of the premiums? 


I'm also very confused with the concept of cashing out dividends. So last year I had around $5-6k in dividends that I cashed out to help pay for medical school expenses. I noticed that now my death benefits/cash value has decreased. Did it decrease because I had the paid up additions option for my dividends? 


Also, looking at my account online, my accounts say anniversary dividend is $216. I thought dividends were calculated on the cash value. I know dividends aren't a guarantee, but assuming they paid out 6%, shouldn't I be getting closer to $1320?


Now if I were to cancel all these whole life policies, I would probably purchase a 20 or 30-year term. My quick look at quotes indicated that a 500k 30-year term will cost me around $31/month or $372 annually. This would be farrrr less than the premium I have to pay if I kept the whole life insurance policies. 


Sorry for the long post but I felt like my parents were duped into getting whole life policies for all of us at such a young age and they don't even know how it works.

I’m 18, soon to be 19. Recently, my girlfriend and I both came to terms with the fact that we are adults, and naturally want to move out of our respective homes. We both live about 6 hours away from each other. After many long talks, we decided that we wanted to move in together. The decision was made that we would move to my town. 

Originally, I considered the fact that we are young, and wanted to look for a place to rent. However, my girlfriend is very attracted to the idea of owning a home, and I am too. Primarily that during renting the money goes “away” and if we were to buy a house our monthly payments would be towards the house, and therefore more meaningful. 

After a lot of research, I decided a home around the $100,000 price point would be a good fit for us, and at that price point we might be able to afford up to a 20% down payment. While searching for homes we would both stay with my mother, and secure jobs we would trust to pay the mortgage on the house. 

I suppose where my questions would start, is purchasing a home at this age wise? I’m aware it is a large undertaking and my main qualm with it is that we may want to move again in the near future, likely selling before the mortgage is complete. Is there a downside to this? 

We consider ourselves proficient at budgeting and wouldn’t mind making a few sacrifices to live with the independence of our own house. 

I probably left details out, so if anyone would want me to fill those in I would be happy to. I would appreciate any and all advice related to buying a home in general, financing, or my situation. Thank you.

Mainly how much like number wise should I be putting in my retirement accounts and do you think paying my wife's car would be a solid idea?

My wife is currently going to school and works part time she has had her first two years of community college paid for from scholarships and will be going to state university next year. Her schooling for the next two years should be around 12,000 +/- for books and whatever type of scholarships she can apply for given her status. We only use her check for car payments and put the rest into our savings. We just plan on paying with a credit card for points and just pay it off. Unless we find a decent interest rate.

Current Budget /  Expenses

I typically work 116 hours every 2 weeks. 

If I work 116 hours I make 1571 after taxes, 84 hrs (no OT) 995 after taxes. (I do not live off my OT, I am using it to put away money for our future plans and yes you're going to ask no way I can survive working that much.) I enjoy what I do and if I am able to work that much I am going to take advantage of it.

My Wife brings hope roughly 600$ per check. We use hers to pay off our car payment and the rest just goes into savings.

**Expenses**

Rent - 830 (Including Utilities) Landlord is a friend of mine that I work with.

Car Payments - 776 (She has a 2017 Honda with 0.9% and 11k left on the loan and we currently pay 400$ which is over the monthly payment.) I made a stupid decision with my car and it was leased. (That ends next March)  Would you consider paying off her car and not worry about a car payment?

Car Insurance / Renters insurance - 125 (per check withdrawn directly from check) I will have to call around and see if we can get this lowered. We both have spotless driving records.

Phone - 103$

RC Willey - 187 (12 months no Interest) Will be paid off in 9

Groceries - 200$

Kitten Food / misc - 100$

Gas - 120$ ( every 2 weeks we each fill up our car 30$ per tank)

Hulu / Netflix - 35$

Personal allowances - 100$ (total)

401k - 40$ (Enough for match)  457 - 40$   Roth IRA - 40$ (All deposited per my check every 2 weeks) I am looking to up at least my 401k and possibly my Roth

Health Insurance - 45$ per check that we deposit into our HSA We have a HDP (Currently have 2600$)

Savings - Minimum 1400$ per month

Emergency Funds - 1000$ immediately accessibly from our Credit union. 32000 in Discover HYSA

Sorry if the formatting seems poor I don't usually makes posts like this but if it doesn't make sense I will do my best to fix it.

**Goals**

I just turned 24 and my Wife will be 21 in December. 
We plan on getting myself a new car next March, we plan on getting a Hybrid or EV.  Nothing is set in stone, but just what we've been looking at.

Also plan on looking for a home in 3 years but before any type of home decision is done though, My wife currently has DACA, we were married last year and started the process to get her Citizenship, but as some of you know. That moves at a snail pace and politically that is in a tough spot. So that is a huge wrench.

**Ending** 
We are allocating a lot of money into our savings so we can put a decent chunk of that into the new car for next year and eventually a home. I do our finances and sit down with her on a monthly basis to keep her in the loop. There isn't a lot of time for Vacations and we both understand that. Once she is done with school and hopefully gets her Citizenship we will go do something. Until then we are just grinding.

I called my insurance company and asked which hospital I should go to. They said that it did not matter which ER as a $300 copay  would cover all costs- they told me to go to the nearest ER since it was an emergency. So I went to the nearest ER and was treated. I paid the $300 copay and I thought that would be the end of it.

About a month later, I got a letter from my insurance company saying that the doctor I saw at the ER was out of network and that I may receive a bill from that doctor. They told me that even if I am billed I will not have to pay the billed amount as I already paid the copay. They said to call if I got a bill. 

On or around 5/24/19, I got a bill for over $600 that said it was “due now”. I immediately called the insurance company. They said they would take care of it and I should not worry. They said it should take 30-45 days to resolve. 

I should have followed up sooner but I forgot. I finally remembered to call the insurance company on 7/1/19. It turns out nothing had been done! The woman I spoke to put in the wrong inquiry and now it was going to take another 45 days to resolve.

Well, today I got the second bill for the same amount and it says that if it’s not paid in 10 days they will send it to collections. The statement date is 6/28/19. Is 10 days counting the holiday and weekend? 

Again, I called the insurance company immediately. They said they will call the providers office on Monday and resolve it then. 

I’m afraid this providers office is going to send the bill to collections because my insurance company is apparently useless. If this bill is sent to collections do I have any chance in fighting it? I don’t have $600 to give anyone.

I want to give as much detail as I can.  My husband and I are both in our mid-30s, been married for 9 years, with a 7 year old son.  My husband works as a retail district manager and I do freelance virtual assistant work from home (I  work about 20-25 a week). Our annual income is about $97k.  With student loans and credit card debt, we are currently about $35k in the hole.  We both have cars, but both cars are paid off and in good shape. Both of our credit scores are in the mid-600s.  We currently live in a really nice 2 bedroom apartment in a gated community and pay $2075.  Including rent, phones, utilities, insurance, and debt payments (CCs and student loans) we are paying close to $4500 in bills a month.  After taxes &amp; what not, my husband and I bring home about $6,200  a month leaving us with usually about $1500-1700 for household expenses for the month which you would think would be fine, but we are just SQUEAKING by and are unable to save at all.  Our dream and our #1 goal is to own our own home, even though we know it’s a shitty time to buy.  Next March my husband gets his big LTI bonus and we have always been planning on using that for our down payment.  But we know we are in no shape at this point to even consider buying a home until we figure out how to budget and pay down our debt.  

My husband and I both grew up lower middle class with parents that did not know how to manage finances either.  His mom just filed bankruptcy.  His dad is about to lose his home.  My parents arent any better.  Although they own a home, my dad worked 2 jobs all his life (my mom is a homemaker), just recently retired, and besides the house they have no savings and are constantly borrowing money.  It makes me so sad to see my dad who worked hard &amp; honest since he was 16 not be able to afford to take a damn vacation. 

I don’t want us to go down that road.  We’re both college-educated...not that it makes any difference nowadays...and we both have good jobs.  I work only about 20-25 hours a week, and that was a choice both of us agreed on so that I can be at home with our son and involved at his school.  We only had one child because we knew having another would put more strain on our finances and I couldn’t do that to us.  We want to give our son the life we never had.  The nice home in a nice community, vacations, travel, etc.  

But we’re still fucking struggling and it fucking sucks.  

Since the beginning of our marriage I have managed our family finances just because my husband is a procrastinator and bills would never be paid.  He’s trusted me to take care of our finances, and I’ve failed miserably.  I have no idea what I am doing wrong.  At the beginning of each month, I sit down and figure out bills &amp; budget for that month and everything looks good.  But then by the end of that month, we are broke.  We are always broke and I fucking hate it.

We are friendly with a couple at church.  They are the same age and make about the same amount.  They have 2 children, a nice home, and are constantly talking about ‘saving for their next vacation’...they go on small fun trips like 2 or 3 times a year.    YES IM SUPER JEALOUS but also curious.  HOW?!?!? And what am I doing wrong?????

TLDR; help me I’m poor.

EDIT/UPDATE: Thanks for all the replies! I've read through them all and appreciate all the advice.  I've never really spoken about money with anyone besides my parents and husband, so this kinda made me nervous but I'm thankful I did it.  I'm gonna answer some questions I think I should have in my initial post. 

Regarding moving to a more affordable part of the country, it's just not an option for us.  My husband's job is here, and our family is here.  My son is an only child and it's important to us that he grows up with all of his cousins that live nearby.  Both sets of his grandparents are nearby and he is extremely extremely close to each one of them.  We live in San Bernardino County, which is much cheaper than Los Angeles County.  I actually grew up in metro LA and lived there until about 3 years ago when my husband and I decided to move out here to where it's cheaper and the school district we have our son in now is outstanding.  I love it here, and I don't want to move.  I want to be able to afford to live here, which is why I am asking for guidance! 

The gated community I live in is not cheap, but nothing here is.  I didnt mean for it to sound hella fancy.  It's a normal, nice, clean gated apartment community in a nice neighborhood.  My kid's school is literally down the street.  $2,000 for a 2-bedroom, 1000sqft apartment where I live is pretty average.  As for more details on our expenses, oy. Ok.  So our recurring monthly bills are: Rent ($2075), Internet/Cable ($130), Light/Gas ($125), 2 iPhones ($200), student loans ($220), irs/tax ($200), car insurance for 2 cars ($300), la galaxy season tickets ($175), Netflix (14.99), 5 cc's ($600). So I miscalculated on my initial post saying our monthly bills are $4500, they are about $4100.  Between the both of us, my husband and I have 5 credit cards.  We each have one from before we were married, and then we have 3 that we've taken out in the last 10 years.  As of today, our student loan debt is about $24,900.  Our CC debt is close to $10,000.  We have no other debt.  

We aren't fancy people.  I'm not a fancy girl. I get my eyebrows done twice a month, and that costs less than $11 each time.  I do my own mani/pedi at home and always have.  I dont like labels. We're not  materialistic and dont care to have the newest shit at all.  80% of my kids clothes are secondhand from older cousins, the rest I buy cheap from Walmart/Target/Ross because he outgrows them in 2.5 seconds. The big splurge we have is the galaxy season tickets but we're obsessed and we have so much fun going to games.  And I always bring in snacks so we arent tempted to buy any overpriced shit there.  The other thing I know we buy a lot of is books.  My husband, son, and I read shit tons and we are buy new books from Amazon probably more than we should.  Funny my husband just told me the other day that we had to look into getting library cards lol.  

After reading all your responses last night, I looked at my bank app and went through all of june and I think we are overspending on eating out/groceries/food in general.  I cook most of our meals at home, but we still eat out/snack out more than we should.  Especially my husband because I can see that his lunch meals are adding up, even if he's only spending like $10 each time.  And our grocery bill should probably be wayyyy less than what it is.  I'm seeing that in June I spent about $700 in groceries alone.  That's insane considering we are a family of 3. Is that insane?  As for me working, yes I need to work more hours.  My degree is in creative writing because I thought I was going to be the next Sandra Cisneros.  Instead, I started bartending at 21 and spent most of my 20's ripping bongloads and traveling around which was fun but oyyyy im feeling it now.  I love working from home as a virtual assistant.  I only have 1 client now that I work 20-25 hours a week for, but I agree that I need to be working more now that my son is older and requires much less attention.  SO after reading all the initial responses, first thing I am going to do is download mint or every dollar or ynab, not sure which one yet.  Next thing I am going to do is sit down with my husband and REALLY look at what we are spending, which is something I am dreading because he is not gonna be happy. I think he is gonna shit an indian red brick when he sees what we spent on food last month.  But we need to really get on top of where the money is going.  My son starts school in 4 weeks so as soon as he is back in school all day, I am going to work on getting a 2nd client and going fulltime.  I wanted to ask about those credit card consolidation things.  Should I look into that?  To help pay off my 5 cc's quicker?  Oh, I also wanted to mention that we KNOW we aren't ready to buy next March.  I'm not saying we are looking to buy when my husband gets his LTI.  That was the GOAL, but we obviously have a long long road to go before we buy a home.  We are most likely going to use it to help pay down our debt.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey first time poster. I want to give as much detail as I can.

Next March my husband gets his big LTI bonus and we have always been planning on using that for our down payment.  But we know we are in no shape at this point to even consider buying a home until we figure out how to budget and pay down our debt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband and I both grew up lower middle class with parents that did not know how to manage finances either.  His mom just filed bankruptcy.  His dad is about to lose his home.  My parents arent any better.  Although they own a home, my dad worked 2 jobs all his life (my mom is a homemaker), just recently retired, and besides the house they have no savings and are constantly borrowing money.  It makes me so sad to see my dad who worked hard &amp;amp; honest since he was 16 not be able to afford to take a damn vacation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want us to go down that road.  We’re both college-educated...not that it makes any difference nowadays...and we both have good jobs.  I work only about 20-25 hours a week, and that was a choice both of us agreed on so that I can be at home with our son and involved at his school.  We only had one child because we knew having another would put more strain on our finances and I couldn’t do that to us.  We want to give our son the life we never had.  The nice home in a nice community, vacations, travel, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re still fucking struggling and it fucking sucks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of our marriage I have managed our family finances just because my husband is a procrastinator and bills would never be paid.  He’s trusted me to take care of our finances, and I’ve failed miserably.  I have no idea what I am doing wrong.  At the beginning of each month, I sit down and figure out bills &amp;amp; budget for that month and everything looks good.  But then by the end of that month, we are broke.  We are always broke and I fucking hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are friendly with a couple at church.  They are the same age and make about the same amount.  They have 2 children, a nice home, and are constantly talking about ‘saving for their next vacation’...they go on small fun trips like 2 or 3 times a year.    YES IM SUPER JEALOUS but also curious.  HOW?!?!? And what am I doing wrong?????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; help me I’m poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT/UPDATE: Thanks for all the replies! I&amp;#39;ve read through them all and appreciate all the advice.  I&amp;#39;ve never really spoken about money with anyone besides my parents and husband, so this kinda made me nervous but I&amp;#39;m thankful I did it.  I&amp;#39;m gonna answer some questions I think I should have in my initial post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding moving to a more affordable part of the country, it&amp;#39;s just not an option for us.  My husband&amp;#39;s job is here, and our family is here.  My son is an only child and it&amp;#39;s important to us that he grows up with all of his cousins that live nearby.  Both sets of his grandparents are nearby and he is extremely extremely close to each one of them.  We live in San Bernardino County, which is much cheaper than Los Angeles County.  I actually grew up in metro LA and lived there until about 3 years ago when my husband and I decided to move out here to where it&amp;#39;s cheaper and the school district we have our son in now is outstanding.  I love it here, and I don&amp;#39;t want to move.  I want to be able to afford to live here, which is why I am asking for guidance! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gated community I live in is not cheap, but nothing here is.  I didnt mean for it to sound hella fancy.  It&amp;#39;s a normal, nice, clean gated apartment community in a nice neighborhood.  My kid&amp;#39;s school is literally down the street.  $2,000 for a 2-bedroom, 1000sqft apartment where I live is pretty average.  As for more details on our expenses, oy. Ok.  So our recurring monthly bills are: Rent ($2075), Internet/Cable ($130), Light/Gas ($125), 2 iPhones ($200), student loans ($220), irs/tax ($200), car insurance for 2 cars ($300), la galaxy season tickets ($175), Netflix (14.99), 5 cc&amp;#39;s ($600). So I miscalculated on my initial post saying our monthly bills are $4500, they are about $4100.  Between the both of us, my husband and I have 5 credit cards.  We each have one from before we were married, and then we have 3 that we&amp;#39;ve taken out in the last 10 years.  As of today, our student loan debt is about $24,900.  Our CC debt is close to $10,000.  We have no other debt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;#39;t fancy people.  I&amp;#39;m not a fancy girl. I get my eyebrows done twice a month, and that costs less than $11 each time.  I do my own mani/pedi at home and always have.  I dont like labels. We&amp;#39;re not  materialistic and dont care to have the newest shit at all.  80% of my kids clothes are secondhand from older cousins, the rest I buy cheap from Walmart/Target/Ross because he outgrows them in 2.5 seconds. The big splurge we have is the galaxy season tickets but we&amp;#39;re obsessed and we have so much fun going to games.  And I always bring in snacks so we arent tempted to buy any overpriced shit there.  The other thing I know we buy a lot of is books.  My husband, son, and I read shit tons and we are buy new books from Amazon probably more than we should.  Funny my husband just told me the other day that we had to look into getting library cards lol.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading all your responses last night, I looked at my bank app and went through all of june and I think we are overspending on eating out/groceries/food in general.  I cook most of our meals at home, but we still eat out/snack out more than we should.  Especially my husband because I can see that his lunch meals are adding up, even if he&amp;#39;s only spending like $10 each time.  And our grocery bill should probably be wayyyy less than what it is.  I&amp;#39;m seeing that in June I spent about $700 in groceries alone.  That&amp;#39;s insane considering we are a family of 3. Is that insane?  As for me working, yes I need to work more hours.  My degree is in creative writing because I thought I was going to be the next Sandra Cisneros.  Instead, I started bartending at 21 and spent most of my 20&amp;#39;s ripping bongloads and traveling around which was fun but oyyyy im feeling it now.  I love working from home as a virtual assistant.  I only have 1 client now that I work 20-25 hours a week for, but I agree that I need to be working more now that my son is older and requires much less attention.  SO after reading all the initial responses, first thing I am going to do is download mint or every dollar or ynab, not sure which one yet.  Next thing I am going to do is sit down with my husband and REALLY look at what we are spending, which is something I am dreading because he is not gonna be happy. I think he is gonna shit an indian red brick when he sees what we spent on food last month.  But we need to really get on top of where the money is going.  My son starts school in 4 weeks so as soon as he is back in school all day, I am going to work on getting a 2nd client and going fulltime.  I wanted to ask about those credit card consolidation things.  Should I look into that?  To help pay off my 5 cc&amp;#39;s quicker?  Oh, I also wanted to mention that we KNOW we aren&amp;#39;t ready to buy next March.  I&amp;#39;m not saying we are looking to buy when my husband gets his LTI.  That was the GOAL, but we obviously have a long long road to go before we buy a home.  We are most likely going to use it to help pay down our debt.&lt;/p&gt;

I used to work for a contractor that supplies support staff for the client’s store renovations. I’m good at my job, and was exceptionally good for being an employee of that company. I caught the eye of a project manager and ended up working on store renovations almost exclusively for several months.

I got really fed up with the contractor (knew I’d be moving in the nearish future and the inconsistent hours made budgeting impossible) and asked the project manager for a job with the client company. He told me of a posting to apply for and I did and got the job.

My last full year of working as a contractor I made $22,000. I expected to be making around $30,000-$35,000 with this new job. I was offered $40,000 and immediately accepted. I was just so happy to be making almost double and so happy to be made the offer to begin with. I think I was worth that amount then but probably could have negotiated higher.

My contract ends next March and I know I’m much more valuable now. Even 3-4 months after signing this contract I’m worth more than what I make. I’ve grown so much and another project manager has said it’s his responsibility to get me to an even higher level - I have ambitions and they know it.

I really, really like this company and the people I’ve met (very little interactions with HR - two different interviews for 2 different departments and no HR person showed up) so I don’t want to insert foot in mouth. I know that my current contractual situation isn’t a long term goal, but not to sound arrogant, I’m a catch and they’re stupid to get rid of me.

I want to be able to get paid what I’m worth (I’m not trying to rip them off) without being rude or too aggressive. I don’t have those personality traits and I don’t want to be perceived as that kind of person.

If all things go well, I will be running the store level renovations (everything to do with the day-to-day “get it done” will be my responsibility and still be overseen by a manager to deal with operations and logistics). That’s a huge step up from where I started and my pay needs to reflect that. I was thinking maybe $45,000 is fair.

For background, I was made redundant from my previous marketing executive role having been at the company for 5 years, in that role for almost 3. I'm ready to make the move up to a brand manager position, and am looking for somewhere I can be creative, express my personality etc. I also had a 1hr 5min commute in my previous job, which I'm looking to reduce.\n\nThe first offer is a brand manager position with company A - a small, relatively young business who are just starting to build out their marketing team. I would be reporting to the head of marketing in a team of 2. They've just successfully crowdfunded to refit their operation and have strong ambitions for growth, though with small businesses this is far from guaranteed in practice. In terms of career progression, it's more likely the team would build out around me than having an obvious progression path in place. People wise, I have a strong belief in their founders who are still involved in the business, and got on well with the hiring manager. They're offering the same as I was on at my previous job, for a brand manager position (more responsibility). Commute time is 30 min cycle, which I am very much in favour of as i very much enjoy cycling and find it relaxing and beneficial to my mental health.\n\nThe second offer is a brand manager position with company B - an SME, more established than company A but still not huge. Be in a larger marketing team, of about 8 people. Definitely a clearer career progression path and the business is performing well, but I'm not so passionate about the product. Really rate the MD, however didn't initially click with the hiring manager.

For background, I was made redundant from my previous marketing executive role having been at the company for 5 years, in that role for almost 3. I&amp;#39;m ready to make the move up to a brand manager position, and am looking for somewhere I can be creative, express my personality etc. I also had a 1hr 5min commute in my previous job, which I&amp;#39;m looking to reduce.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first offer is a brand manager position with company A - a small, relatively young business who are just starting to build out their marketing team. I would be reporting to the head of marketing in a team of 2. They&amp;#39;ve just successfully crowdfunded to refit their operation and have strong ambitions for growth, though with small businesses this is far from guaranteed in practice. In terms of career progression, it&amp;#39;s more likely the team would build out around me than having an obvious progression path in place. People wise, I have a strong belief in their founders who are still involved in the business, and got on well with the hiring manager. They&amp;#39;re offering the same as I was on at my previous job, for a brand manager position (more responsibility). Commute time is 30 min cycle, which I am very much in favour of as i very much enjoy cycling and find it relaxing and beneficial to my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second offer is a brand manager position with company B - an SME, more established than company A but still not huge. Be in a larger marketing team, of about 8 people. Definitely a clearer career progression path and the business is performing well, but I&amp;#39;m not so passionate about the product. Really rate the MD, however didn&amp;#39;t initially click with the hiring manager. They are offering 10k more than the other position, but it&amp;#39;s a 1hr 20min commute by public transport, which would be very busy at peak times (i live in a capital city) and cost about 12 quid per day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically - my gut says to go with company A, even though objectively company B has better salary and prospects.

Summary; fidelity or vanguard for incoming college student with 2k to invest? And possible investments?

I have worked a low paying job for the last few years and have 2k in savings ready to invest. I will likely be getting a monthly income around $100-200 while I’m in college for the next 4 years, which can all go into investments as I’m fortunate enough for a scholarship.

I have a few questions. Should I go with vanguard or fidelity? I’ve heard vanguard is owned by its clients, which is an advantage and also how they manage your index funds for you. I’m not planning on being too involved with my financial portfolio. I’ll likely follow a buy and hold strategy for 15+ years with consistent monthly investments into diverse mutual funds and index funds. Some pluses I’ve heard about fidelity are the zero commission tradings, but I’m not sure how relevant that is in my case. Also they have better app UI apparently.

&amp;#x200B;

To keep a long story short, my ex-girlfriend and I were living together at an apartment that we just renewed our lease for. Things turned for the worst and she wants me to get out and go live somewhere else. I don't want to make this a big deal for the both of us and I just want to get out of there, so I agreed to leave peacefully. However, as stated previously our lease was just renewed a month ago, it is a 12 month lease -- 10 more to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bank account: Give or take $100 between checking and savings.

Loans: I have 10k left on my car loan and about 45k in student loans.

I work part time as I am a student and roughly make $900-$1000 a month. Car takes $388 of that... not a good decision as an 18 year old. I strongly recommend not buying a car at 18.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what steps I can take to break this lease or how I should go about this. Financially, I can't afford to get out of there. Additionally, we have just purchased furniture on my credit card which was suppose to be split between us, the total is roughly $1500. My credit score is decent for my age, \~730-740 at 22, and I don't want this to ruin it, based off my credit card balance and my name on the lease. She's already pretty terrible at paying things on time and I don't want her to bring me down with her. If there is no way out of this without just paying my way out then I am toast. Is there a way to preserve my credit in this process of going under??


Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice, I’ll weight the options suggested and think about my next move.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this post qualifies as appropriate for this subreddit as I didn&amp;#39;t know where to post my situation.&lt;/p&gt;

I don&amp;#39;t want to make this a big deal for the both of us and I just want to get out of there, so I agreed to leave peacefully. However, as stated previously our lease was just renewed a month ago, it is a 12 month lease -- 10 more to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank account: Give or take $100 between checking and savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loans: I have 10k left on my car loan and about 45k in student loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work part time as I am a student and roughly make $900-$1000 a month. Car takes $388 of that... not a good decision as an 18 year old. I strongly recommend not buying a car at 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know what steps I can take to break this lease or how I should go about this. Financially, I can&amp;#39;t afford to get out of there. Additionally, we have just purchased furniture on my credit card which was suppose to be split between us, the total is roughly $1500. My credit score is decent for my age, ~730-740 at 22, and I don&amp;#39;t want this to ruin it, based off my credit card balance and my name on the lease. She&amp;#39;s already pretty terrible at paying things on time and I don&amp;#39;t want her to bring me down with her. If there is no way out of this without just paying my way out then I am toast. Is there a way to preserve my credit in this process of going under??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice, I’ll weight the options suggested and think about my next move.&lt;/p&gt;

They also forced me to live in a convent - I can’t get out because this place costs about £7500 a year to live in. In this city the absolute lowest rent prices are £9000. Luckily my school offered a grant of £3000 to supplement my student loan. However this was calculated based on my rent, which is way below the margin of anything realistic in the area. That’s how I’m still stuck in the situation. 

I made up the bare difference from thevjobs I had alongside studying (tutoring, babysitting, and upselling 
 designer pieces). However I was never able to get a real job - the cafes and stores wanted someone with experience in these jobs. I was never allowed to get a job before 18 - I went to a boarding school and in holidays my parents refused to let me out of the house. I had no savings and as a result I just haven’t been able to save up to get myself out of the situation. I really tried - many weeks I hardly ate, barely left the house because I could pretty much only afford rent and transport to school. I could eat out from time to time, but definitely couldn’t go out. I missed so many classes that I had to defer an exam to August, but somehow I managed to scrape a really good grade with the 3 other modules - this means I can at least get an internship for next summer which will lead to a real job. But for this year applications are closed.

On top of this I’m at law school, which is incredibly time consuming - there really isn’t time for too many distractions as it is. 

I tried to apply for many paid internships for this summer, but I couldn’t get any of them - I know this is mostly because my first year grades couldn’t get me into the competitive schemes. I otherwise have a very strong track academic record, and already 5 internships at top firms/companies and go to one of the best law schools. However a lot of the other paid internships (non “city” jobs, in-house, fashion-related etc) I applied for were probably put off by the fact that my past experiences were city firms (and they can assume I got them due to connections since I’m only 19). Some of them I failed the online character tests, despite passing numerical and written tests. Others simply didn’t respond, or didn’t give feedback when I asked. Some said I was too shy! 

So on top of my finances I’m now worried about my career but I accepted that I just need the money. But even with the lower requirement jobs, in retail and service, experience was needed. I have to move out of the convent in 2 weeks and I literally have no money. For the past few weeks I have been babysitting for my sister who is kind to be paying me £8 an hour (she knows my parents have abandoned me and the full extent of the situation but isn’t fully willing/able to help out. She’s pregnant and has an 8 month old baby). From this job I don’t actually make a profit unless I work for 4 hours at a time, because of transport costs. And usually she only wants 3 hours. 

Her husband of 2 months, who has known of me for only 2 years, and does not know me at all, keeps insinuating that I’m only in university to keep my parents happy and I should just quit- he works in sales and didn’t go to university. My sister works in finance and is the higher earner by a lot, however with maternity leave pay she is obviously the lower earner). 
For me, dropping out is out of the question - I worked very hard to get into this university. I know that even if I graduate with the worst grades here, it is still a big deal to have attended and graduated. However, I am much more capable and still ambitious and I still want to do really well and I have a lot of specific goals I want to realise. I have a business idea I’m working on for example, and it’s something I’ve wanted since I was 12. But right now I’m slipping to a point where I’m living “paycheck to paycheck” and hardly being paid at all. I also have to leave the convent, and I’m 3 weeks behind on rent, and have no place to go. I also have an exam in 6 weeks. 

I am actually formally trying to apply as an independent student for the next academic year so I can get a realistic student loan - this. Basically involves me cutting off my parents. I also need proof of why/how I’m estranged but because of certain circumstances it’s close to impossible.

Separate from that, I also had a car loan.

I filled out and submitted a form 108 (which I have copies of and I am looking at right now) and checked off that both mortgages will be retained by the co-debter and that I will retain the car and continue to pay the car loan.

I am looking to buy a house now that two years have passed and  I just checked my credit reported and Transunion stated that my second down payment assistance mortgage and car loan were filed in the bankruptcy.

Equifax and Experian do not even acknowledge that I had the second down payment assistance mortgage at all. It is not listed on my credit report at all and they both state the car loan was included in the bankruptcy.

&amp;#x200B;

My main mortgage with my ex IS listed on all three reports and was stated that it was NOT included in the bankruptcy because it wasn't, the house was not foreclosed. So how is it that my two mortgages and car loan were all listed on the same form but only my mortgage was the only one stated as not in the bankruptcy?

Also while my second mortgage for the down payment assistance says that it was released in the bankruptcy, IT WASN'T, my ex continued to pay that and paid it off fully when he sold the house.

Also my car loan wasn't released in the bankruptcy either, no one came to get my car and it is now fully paid off.

Can I pick your brains about something?

I have an old pension from my gov’t job back in Canada (I’m a citizen but living in NYC). I honestly forgot about it until recently, when I called to get some details about it. 

I only contributed for 3 years, but it is vested. I have the option of taking a lump sum payment of 19k CDN  (I would obviously wait until the CDN dollar goes up) or getting the lifetime payment of $150/month CDN until I die. 

Obviously the pension is “worth” more than 19k if I take the lifetime payment option but I am wondering if it’s a smarter decision to just cash it out and invest it in my IRA as I am currently 30 and have quite a few years before retirement. 

What’s my move here PF?

Here is my situation:

1. I am mid/late-30s and live in California, USA.
2. I do not have a house, nor car, but know how to make this work and keep my expenses low, about $1,000-$2,000mo.. Most of my net worth is tied up in crypto, currently \~$125,000. But we all know those winds can change. That is my retirement money. I have an additional $30,000 in a bank. I work irregularly as a freelancer and consequently try to stay very liquid in case of an emergency or dry spell with work. I fully subscribe to everyone having a suitable liquid emergency fund.
3. I have no revolving debt...once in my 20s digging out from a mountain credit card debt was enough, and I promised myself to never carry a revolving balance again. If I can't afford something immediately, it is a luxury I have not yet earned.
4. I see the debt-free finish line. My total remaining student debt is \~$850. (Down from a $30,000 principal fifteen years ago.) The interest rate is an absurdly favorable 2.8%. My loan payment is $114/mo. For anyone reading this, yes, I know that is low...there was an opportunity to consolidate in the mid-2000s and I took it. I have no idea how I'd afford school now at 6%+.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is: What are the pros/cons of paying off this remaining student debt early?**

I could put the same $850 into crypto and in nine months, it will (likely) gain far more than the interest I will have paid. Or even an index fund would be solid.

But there is also the *psychology of just being* ***done*** *and debt free*. How does one evaluate the opportunity cost of that feeling against ""smart choice"" to wait and continue to pay it off over nine more months? That is nine months of stress.

All comments welcome. I'd really just like to hear second opinions and I'll reply as best I can. Thank you.

&lt;li&gt;In debt £900 on a 0% credit card&lt;/li&gt;

Title is self explanatory, but the background is pretty important.  

I'm a professional school graduate student, and I am in my last year of school. I currently have approximately $34k in loans, and I am on course to graduate after an taking additional $40-50k in loans over the coming 16 months or so (approximately $80k in debt at graduation in 5/2020 - likely first paycheck afterwards in 11/2020). First scheduled repayment is on 12/2020. These loans have a 6-7% interest rate (after this year, my weighted average interest rate will be around 6.5%).  

I am currently in an internship that, in more cases than not, results in a full time job offer. Given everything so far, I believe it is probable that I will have a job with a first paycheck around 11/2020.  

All that said, I am currently contemplating between maxing out my IRA contributions this year and just borrowing that much less in the coming months. Functionally, this will be equivalent to taking out a loan at 6.5% rate to contribute to IRA. I know this is unreasonable in most scenarios *BUT*  

I am liquidity constrained until I start my job since the job, if I get it, will likely be for a $190k/yr that I expect to hold for at least a few years (with annual lock-step raises). I will be in a high-local-tax market, so my first year take-home should be around $100k. I think I can pay off the loans reasonably quickly without too much of a belt-tightening (modest projections suggest 3 years; possible lower rate refinancing as well). Consequently, I see this as a question of the long term (20+ yrs) benefits of starting an IRA a year early VS less loans/risks in the medium term (~5yrs). I am a pretty risk averse person, so my investment returns will likely be lower than the loan rates (especially given risk exposure). In case it is relevant, I am in mid twenties, so I am a *very, very long* way from retirement.  

I found a few discussions online on the subject, but most were for current workers contemplating paying excess income towards paying off existing student loans vs higher IRA contributions.

&lt;p&gt;I just took out a student loan of $15k at 10% interest. Still not a great interest rate but better than 25%. We can pay more than interest now on it while we are still in school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I previously had a student loan which I was making monthly payments on and was at $12k. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now our total Debt on my report is $27.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the midst of taking out the loan I got 4 hard pulls, and a new account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I logged on the credit karma today and both transunion and Equifax, as well as creditwise from my capital one account ALL jumped up to 730. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huhwhat?????? How does this make any sense? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone explain why this move on my credit would make it go up? I&amp;#39;ve been trying to move things around to get my husbands score up above 700. We both need to be above 700 for next years move. But I was convinced mine was going to take a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

I've also seen a lot of rule of thumb methods described, explaining practical steps to manage money and wealth on a day-to-day basis. But I haven't seen much discussion on double-entry bookkeeping (DEB), which is the universal standard for keeping accurate track of an entity's financial position and performance over time and has been used by virtually every business with no fundamental change since the 14th century. 

&amp;#x200B;

From experience, I know that many people are quick to discount using DEB for private finances because it is too hard; they assume you need to be an accountant to do it or that it will take too much of their time. I think that used to be the case until a few years ago but now there are a bunch of readily available cloud accounting software that will connect directly to your bank accounts, credit cards, mortgage, investment accounts, etc and reduce most of the 'back-office' work that used to come with keeping a ledger. I personally use Xero (disclosure: no association with them, just a happy customer) and find that their UX is extremely intuitive and easy to use.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you are set up and your day-to-day transactions start coming through the Xero feed, it only takes a few minutes every other day to keep it all perfectly balanced and reconciled - not only just income and expenses but changes to assets and liabilities too. I think this is much easier and less stressful than my previous 'method' which involved a periodic session to review what had happened in the last month/period and didn't include the self-balancing, error-correcting mechanism of DEB.

&amp;#x200B;

Through DEB you can have perfect and instant visibility of your financial position at any given point in time (the relationship between your assets, liabilities, and equity) and your financial performance over a time period (the relationship between income, expenses, and profit/loss) down to each cent. From that base, setting up and tracking goals, setting up a budget and then comparing it to actuals, planning for retirement or major purchases, it all becomes very easy.

&amp;#x200B;

Keeping a ledger will fundamentally change your financial mindset - everything becomes very clearly connected. You will start to appreciate that every single economic event that you are a party to affects you twice as two opposing quantities of cause and effect. Going from a non-DEB to a DEB system is like going from navigating using a compass and a few points of reference to having a GPS producing detailed, highly accurate information about where you are, where you are going, and your options for getting there.

“Double-entry bookkeeping is borne of the same spirit as the system of Galileo and Newton… With the same means as these, it orders the phenomenon into an elegant system, and it may be called the first cosmos built on the basis of mechanistic thought. Double-entry bookkeeping discloses to us the cosmos of the economic world by the same method as, later, the cosmos of the stellar universe was unveiled by the great investigation of natural philosophy… One can scarcely conceive of capitalism without double-entry book-keeping: they are related as are form and context.

I have been paying attention to my credit score closely over the last 6 months or so. I signed up to clear score and have a score of 460/700.

Only other stipulation is 4 people must comfortably fit, so I am thinking a larger sedan or smaller SUV. I buying a brand new vehicle, technically can use it for 4 years.

**My situation**- my car is a payed off 2012 with 90k miles and decent shape. Needs a little work but nothing huge, but still an aging vehicle. So my options are a) sell personal, buy company car b) keep personal (3rd car for me&amp; expecting wife), and buy company car c) decline company car and rent a car for long trips. My trips will be occasional 3-6 hours one way rather than short run arounds every day, so rentals are actually feasible, just annoying.

Looking for advice, if anyone can help. If I do buy a car, what $ range should I be looking? All maintenance $ is accounted for in fixed monthly payments, so I won't be reimbursed for anything needing fixed. Any tax considerations that I'm not thinking about?

Background: married couple, early 20s, no kids, living in the Seattle area, I am salaried and my husband is self-employed. We purchased a 2bed 2 bath condo for $314,950 and put 10% down. We would have been able to put 20% or more down but we decided to go with 10%. 

PURCHASE

- $10,000 earnest money

- $625 appraisal

- $75 homeowners course (mandatory)

- $25,499 closing cash

Total = $36,199


FURNITURE: $4,991

CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS: $3,085

MOVING = $131 (2 Uhaul trucks on separate days, fuel)

JUNK REMOVAL = $394 (old vanities, misc junk)

PLUMBING = $1,859

INSURANCE = $292 (HO insurance through Progressive for 1 year)

REIMBURSEMENTS = -$1,839 (escrow overpayment)


Total Cost = $45,082


Improvements:
- new vanities in both bathrooms, new faucets and shower heads;

- replaced vinyl with laminate flooring in the kitchen, entryway and bathrooms;

- painted the walls and ceilings throughout;

- painted kitchen cabinets (it made a HUGE difference);

- replaced power outlets and light switches;

- new bathroom and kitchen fixtures.

We saved A TON of money by doing most of it ourselves. I guess it depends on how comfortable each person is with this sort of thing but it was not too difficult. It took us one month, more or less, to complete the project and have a clean home. When taking on a remodeling project, it's important to know what your limits are. For instance, we decided it is best to contract a plumber for moving the toilets around, moving the piping in the shower, etc. and that was the only professional involved in our little DIY project. Thankfully, we did not have any unpleasant surprises or hidden issues which could have been costly. 

Bottom line, I am happy with the results and with the fact that we added at least $25k in value by spending roughly $6k on cosmetic improvements.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband and I purchased our first home in May.
