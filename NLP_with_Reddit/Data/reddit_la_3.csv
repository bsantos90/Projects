Glad to say I’ve got a happy update!

The coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). I wasn’t working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

The ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. He’s also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. The dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn’t shown any human or dog aggression. 

Police and animal control are very good around here. They assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they’d require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. Additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can’t be “bitten” by the dog without violating it. And the department says they don’t allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog’s owner but not the police/animal control. 

So the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. I’d call it a win!

We've always had to text doctors with our phones if we needed to contact them quickly about a patient issue. I never had a problem with this as I have unlimited texting. Now they've decided thats a potential HIPAA violation and they're forcing us to download an app to access our email/secure messaging app from our phones.

In the fine print of this app it basically says our administrators have 100% full access to our phones. It also says that they can remotely wipe all data on our phones and reset it to factory settings. I'm very not okay with this. 

I brought this up at work and they swore they'd never access our personal information. I asked about remotely wiping it and they said that yes, they would use that feature to protect patient data if an employee was terminated or left the practice on bad terms.

I have 5+ years of memories, text messages, notes and data on my $900 phone. I'm a low paid employee, I don't have a computer, my phone is my computer.

I am certain she is not home, like 100%, and hasn’t been for some time. The question is, what happened to her... these people do not own the house, and they’re lying about her whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll call for a wellness check I think... they’ll know it would be me though, which is troublesome, I have children at home.&lt;/p&gt;

During the appointment, I rated fairly high in their wellbeing test (which is not good). I have bad anxiety and depression that has never been ""diagnosed"" before (as my mother only took me to the doctor only when absolutely neccessary, so I didn't have regular doctor visits nor could I go myself that I know/knew of). 

The doctor asked me some questions, I answered honestly, and she asked how open I was to therapy/counseling and medication. I said I was open to medication, not so much therapy. She prescribed me an antidepressant. My mom just sort of sat there quietly and said nothing. (I think she's in denial that I'm depressed). I'm scheduled to go back in a month to see how well I'm doing with the medication (she said it takes ~4 weeks for the full effect to kick in).

I went over to my dad's house (parents are split) that day and was over there for 3 days. Long enough for my medication to be ready (it takes no longer than a day normally, from what I heard).

My grandma got me from my dad's. My mom and step dad are on a vacation celebrating their anniversary, have been for the past 2 days and still will be for a few more. I texted my mom asking if my medication was ready for pickup or what. No reply. This was over 24 hours ago. I asked my grandma to take me to the pharmacy and see about it, and she said she didn't think she could pick it up for me, and that she thinks my mom already got it. I went home and looked all over the house for it, but it's not there.

Grandma says that she DID pick it up though, as she told her about how it was ""black marked"" or whatever, and she had to show her drivers license to get it. I think that she picked it up and took the medication with them on vacation, intentionally so I couldnt have it. 

When she gets back I plan on confronting her about it. 

If she is intentionally keeping it from me, and not letting me have it whatsoever, do I have any say or recourse in this whatsoever? Or am I just stuck not having it until I'm 18 and able to get it myself without needing her ""approval""?

(I was above the age of 18 but I was under 21)  I bit off more than I could chew, alcohol-wise and ended up vomiting more than I knew was possible and I would have lost consciousness if it weren’t for some people who were looking out for me (or so I thought). I also have zero memories from this night, so this information was relayed to me by these people as well as inferred. Because I threw up, these people took off my clothes and put me in the shower to clean me up, as well as to keep talking to me so I wouldn’t lose consciousness. 

Later, I learned the details of that night when my friends told me what happened, and they showed me videos they took of me, even in the shower. I am the type of person who is very sensitive about the kind of images online that exist of me- I don’t send nudes and I have never even posted a bathing suit picture to my instagram due to my paranoia. I obviously was unable to consent to the video due to my level of intoxication and never would have consented to the video if I was sober, considering it was extremely distressing to watch and I had to beg my friends to stop playing the video. I’m almost certain that they did not ask if they could film, anyways because they never have before- it was common practice to take videos of anything and everything. 

In the video, I am definitely shirtless. I have only seen one of the videos, and in that I don’t think my nipples could be seen, but I have since learned that at least one other video exists, and it has been described as me “completely naked, singing in the bathtub”.  Neither of the videos involve me doing any kind sexual acts. I only learned about the existence of the second video because snapchat memories sent 2 of my friends a notification reminding them of their memories from 1 year ago, and they both mentioned it in a group chat. (one of the girls even asked if I had vomit in my hair, and when she was told that I didn’t she said “Sad”.) I told them not to share the videos with me or anyone else, and asked them to delete the videos. They did not respond to my request, so I have no way of knowing if they did or not. I don’t think they did, but again, I have no way of knowing. 

I feel extremely violated by this- not only because I have no control over these compromising videos, but also because they are on snapchat, which scares me because I’ve heard rumors that snapchat saves what you put on it, and I really really do not feel comfortable with that.   I know that these videos have been shown to other people because when I first saw them, I was not the only one watching. That also made me feel really violated. 

I want to know what my options are for this- is what happened actually illegal? the laws i’ve looked up are mainly about recorded phone conversations or revenge porn, and this doesn’t quite fit into those definitions. But ultimately. my question is what can I do to make sure that these videos are deleted?

Hi, I had an injury where I fell and hit my head on the sidewalk ledge and then twice more on the concrete when I completed my fall. This injury occurred in Wisconsin. The fall happened at my place of employment and was due to a drainage gutter located in the sidewalk ledge due to black ice forming from the gutters draining into parking lot during winter. No witnesses were present at time of fall, but the fall was captured on security cameras of the business. The on-duty manager was notified at the time of accident that I had fallen outside. 

I was feeling fine at this moment and I continued to work as everyone thought nothing of it. I then started to feel nauseous and had a headache. The manager told me to take some pain medicine and I should be fine the next day. Taking the advice, I drove home that night and symptoms started to worsen. Feeling unwell I came to work the next day to speak with owners, I told them I thought it was more and I needed to see someone. They advised me to try a chiropractor so I did and this didn’t help. I couldn’t get into a doctor right away so I had to wait a couple days before seeing someone. I saw numerous doctors with short time frames off and then was sent back to work and at this time was treated differently than before after only being gone about a month with doctor’s orders. 

I had returned to work for 2-3 days before I couldn’t do it anymore. I went back to the doctor where they took me off work for a longer time frame. Every doctor I had previously seen was no longer the best doctor for me or I was unable to be seen by them any longer. A couple months passed seeing general family medicine doctors or employee wellness doctors until I was than referred to neurology about two months after the injury occurrence date. I am still seeing the neurologist who has now released me to return to work with some restrictions. I have been doing therapy for about 2 months, ranging in 3 different types of therapy to help with the pain and suffering I have endured from this injury. Now after completing some therapy I am feeling better and asked to give returning to work a try as it has been \~6-7 months from the injury and \~5-6 months since the last day of work. 

I asked the owners of company who also are the HR people for the business to have a meeting with me in regards to my return and restrictions. The meeting started off well as we discussed these things but then slowly became uncomfortable. The owners of the company came out and said “there is a lot of hard feelings with this injury. You left everyone feeling lost and caused us all a lot of stress by us holding in a position we weren’t sure you could come back too. Everyone has a lot of negative feelings about this injury and feels as though this could have been faked and we weren’t sure if we could trust you. We felt as though you could have been playing the system as nothing was progressing and we weren’t getting any answers.” They talked about how they then got an attorney involved to get some answers to try to push things along. Being as this is a head injury and all the different the doctor had no answers and only time will tell. Owners made it well known to me that they could have terminated me at any time. They also expressed feelings that it took too long to heal and I should have tried harder to get more answers and that they lost faith in me because I didn’t show them, I wanted to be there. All because I didn’t tell my doctor to send me in for a couple hours a week. The only reason I would leave the house was to go to the doctor/therapist. They made it very well know how all my coworkers and bosses have a negative opinion of me and think I was faking the entire brain injury. They told me that upon my return to work my attitude will determine how my comeback goes and how the only thing that restored their faith in me was me asking to hold a meeting to discuss. 

If the work environment becomes toxic due to the owners words, what do I have to do to protect myself?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I had an injury where I fell and hit my head on the sidewalk ledge and then twice more on the concrete when I completed my fall.

I work for a ma-n-pa type cafe. The store I’m currently working at has no kitchen and therefore I’m unable to bake the food for the morning and must wait on the main store to provide me with food in a timely manner.

On multiple occasions I’ve not received my food order until 45 minutes after open. I’ll have customer walk in, ask “where’s the food?” And I can only reply that it hasn’t arrived yet. They of course walk out.

Boss says the store I work at is the biggest opportunity for increased sales, but how am I supposed to do that with no food??? 

This happens again the other day and right before the manager meeting I was furious cuz I have been cussed at and berated by at least 5 customers 30 mins after open for not having food, which is completely out of my control. I told him that if he doesn’t do something to kick the kitchen people into gear to get my food here on time I WILL be quitting.

He and the other managers discussed possible solutions, and I told them (as a former store manager at 2 locations) that they need to discipline them and set up a ‘write-up’ system. They said they don’t want to “lose” anyone due to them not being on time since they are like family and they don’t wanna fire family. So instead they came up with this (over txt): 

“We will be implementing a 5 HOUR tip deduction for every late shift. 3 tardies and you get to talk with the managers about extra punishment.”

Needless to say no one replied. We were all outraged because out of the 15 employees they have, only 3 (in the kitchen) ever cause issues for the store. But whether you are 30 minutes late or 30 seconds late it’s an automatic 5 hour deduction from the tip pool.

Now I work open to close at this store which is a 6 hour shift by myself, but I also live 30 minutes away so I might hit traffic and clock in 2 minutes late here and there, but I will still be severely punished by them takin my tips away! 

And the issue is if I make $20 in tips at the end of day, they aren’t even my tips, it goes into a tip pool and spread out across the other 15 employees based on hours worked for the pay period. So really out of $20 I’m getting about 1.25$ already. But subtract 5 hours and I basically don’t get any tips for the day at ALL.

Is this even legal? I do make a little over minimum wage, but I also have a family to support, so every penny counts!

I would assume garnishing earned wages as punishment is illegal, but I’ve gotten mixed answers from family members since it’s not my “actual pay and only tips” so please let me know! I’m going to be confronting my employers about how unfair this is, cuz if someone gets their tips cut I don’t feel like they are going to give the difference to the remaining employees. I feel like they will just pocket it, cuz they refuse to answer me about it.

I am working for an entrepreneur who has multiple for-profit businesses running all at once. To my knowledge,  The majority of his workforce are unpaid interns. There are some ""paid"" interns, but their pay is comission-only based on how much revenue they bring to the company, and no one has been able to Monetize their tasks yet; therefore, no one has been paid (it's been 3+ months). Everyone on-boarded had signed a NDA and a 1-year agreement contract.

I am an unpaid business manager intern, helping in the hiring process. I review resumes, set up interview times, interview applicants etc. This internship is digital/remote, and I naïevely accepted it since I was rejected by every other company and I have no car.

I admit I was really gullible and I should have realized these things sooner that i am about to discuss below. 

My boss started using a new website for hiring, and after reading the job listings he wrote, he put a big (i.e. $100k+, $30-40k) salary that I believe is very misleading for a couple reasons. 1) None of his businesses have made any revenue and 2) NO ONE in the company has been paid and it's been months. In the other websites he has used for job postings, he did not post these salary prices, and the listings clearly state that pay is based on commission only. 

Luckily, pretty much every applicant applying through this new website saw straight through this bullsh*t during the interview process and refused to sign the contract. 

When confronted about it, my boss believes it is okay because he thinks he will be very profitable by the end of the year (which I highly disagree with by the way he runs things) and that they can reach those salary numbers if they are truly motivated since it is comission based.  

So my first question is: is it legal to advertise a big salary when there is no concrete evidence to support it as no one in the company has even been paid? 

Next topic of concern is the legality of an unpaid intern workforce. I did some research and found that the Department of Labor has certain requirements. Although My boss has 1 non-profit 501(c)3,  he also has for-profits, which is what all the interns are working for. The company name is very misleading as it suggests we are a non-profit when we really are not. To my knowledge, there are also no real salaried employees, and he is relying on unpaid interns/""paid"" interns (once again, comission only pay, and no one has been paid yet) to do everything for him. He has also promised me multiple times that if I reach a certain goal, I will get paid even though I had signed an agreement for an unpaid internship. He also said he would buy a me company computer If the company makes a lot of money. I have yet to address this issue of unpaid interns to my boss as I am worried of his response. 

Now you might be thinking, why am I still working for this person? I really don't feel comfortable 
 after making these relevations. I am actively looking for new internships, and luckily have been accepted to interview for very well-known companies. However, I am worried that if these companies were to contact my  current boss for a reference, he could potentially say something negative about me if I were to report/confront him about his shady practices, affecting my chances. I am the only other person in the company who has access/knowledge of his hiring practices. I need this other internship in order to graduate as the one I am currently working at does not meet my school's requirements. 

I really don't know what to do at this point.  Ever since I have discovered all this, I have not hired anyone new to the company as it feels wrong. 

So to sum it up:

Is it legal to post very misleading salaries on job listings?
Is my unpaid internship even legal? Can I leave it even though I signed a 1-year contract? What happens if my current boss gives me a bad reference to my future employers?

I've admired this sub for a long time, and now the day has come that I need to ask this community for input.

&amp;#x200B;

**Backstory**: My girlfriend and I bought a house in December and needed to leave our apartment by the end of February (3 months before the end of our lease). We informed our landlord right away and he told us we could sublease the apartment for the remainder of the contract, *or* that he'd be willing to start a fresh lease with new tenants and terminate our lease early. We had been nervous about moving out ahead of the lease's end, so we were relieved to hear he was willing to work with us.

&amp;#x200B;

We posted an ad and found great prospective tenants to start a new lease with him. Our landlord dropped off applications for them, which they promptly filled and submitted. Then, several weeks went by without a word from the landlord on whether they were approved or declined, despite repeated inquiries by us and the applicants. Around this time we randomly ran into our landlord. He was congratulatory about the new house and assured us that ""the ball was rolling"" on the applications and that he didn't ""see any reason they wouldn't be suitable tenants."" We said goodbye, felt some relief, then...didn't hear from him. As move out/in day approached, we were getting anxious as we still did not have an answer from the landlord. With no new lease signed, we reverted to the sublease option and, thankfully, the tenants agreed to sublet from us. At this point, we were feeling annoyed that the landlord had gone MIA, but glad we were able to find tenants to cover the cost of rent for the remainder of the lease.

&amp;#x200B;

With only 2 weeks to go before the subletters were planned to move in, all of the sudden, the landlord pipes up out of nowhere, declaring that our options now are to a) pay for the remainder of time on the lease (3 months = $6000) or pay $1000 for a ""lease modification"". In his email there was no mention of the original options (i.e subleasing or starting the fresh lease with new tenants). I replied, confused, as this is the first time we'd heard anything about a ""lease modification"" fee in the \~12 weeks we'd been corresponding with him about this transition. Not surprisingly, he does not respond to my subsequent emails, texts, calls nor my requests to meet and speak in person. In the absence of any clarification from the landlord, we go forward with our subletting plan, the tenants move in and pay us rent monthly for last 3 months of the contract, which we, in turn, pay to the landlord. After the 3 months, the new tenants actually did manage to sign a new lease with the landlord and stay on in the apartment. Despite the bizarre message and absenteeism by the landlord, everything appeared to have turned out great. Everybody wins, right?

&amp;#x200B;

**Wrong**. Fast-forward to today when we received our deposit back. We were docked $1250, 1k of which was for ""lease modification."" In a hand-scrawled explanation landlord states that we allowed ""unknown persons"" into the apartment and failed to return keys to him (keys went directly to subletters/now-lessees). He even withheld additional funds for a carpet cleaning that did not take place and for the cost of a 70s-era microwave that we had him remove from the apartment before we even moved in. We somewhat expected him to try to dock us for a couple weird things like those, but the reemergence of this ""lease modification"" notion came as a shock.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions:**

1. Is there any validity to this lease modification fee? Does having subletters (with permission) even constitute a change to the lease? It should be noted there was no mention of this fee in our original lease or during the first 12 weeks of correspondence about this transition.
2. Do we have grounds to sue in small claims court for remainder of deposit? Is this the proper course of action? What should we do?

Location: Massachusetts, USA

Someone called me last night looking to purchase a watch that I had for sale. We settled on a price and planned to meet. I wanted to meet somewhere open and public. 

I called him this morning and he was asking questions about the authenticity of the watch. He asked me to send a couple photos, which I happily obliged. I knew it was authentic, so I asked to meet at a Jeweler so that they can authenticate it for him. He had a Jewler in mind, and we planned to meet there at 1pm today. 

Come 1:00 PM, I pull up to the Jewler to find it closed. He walked over to my car and started small talk. The watch was in the car, when he took it and sprinted off. Tons of people saw him, as it was a public parking lot. He jumped in the passengers window and his wife sped off. I chased him down to get the plate number and put it in the notes in my phone. 

I called 911 immediately. The police came (she was extremely rude, but that's neither here nor there). I gave them the name of the guy (the name that he gave me), his plate number, height and age (guesstimates), phone number, and a couple of his tattoos that I had remembered. The police left and told me they will be in touch. 

I go home and start my research. After some time, I reverse look up the phone number that he called me from. (Some online service, paid $4.00). It came back to a females number, same town I was robbed in. I type her name into Google and find her Facebook. Her relationship status was ""In a Relationship"". I clicked on the boyfriend and it was the same person that robbed me. There was not a doubt in my mind. His tattoos matched and everything.

I did some research on him, and he has a colorful past in the city where this a took place. I called the city's police office and gave the officer his real name, along with his girlfriend's name. I asked if she can somehow just go to his house, but she said no. She said she will just add his name to the report and told me to wait to hear back.  They seemed very uninterested in helping me out, or even giving me information. It seemed as though it is already on the back burner, as they have other business to get to first. I called my Uncle who is a state police officer. I also emailed the chief of police in the town.

I filed a claim with American Express, as I purchased it on my Amex Platinum card and they offer purchase protection (only up to a certain value, though).

___________________________


So, I guess my question is what should I expect? What should I do? Am I able to just bring this guy to court? Any advice with filing claims? I'm not quite sure what to even ask advice on, I am still flustered. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. This was a very expensive watch and it was brand new. It certainly hurts. ""Shoulda, coulda, woulda""... but what happened happened, and I am just trying to figure out what to do from here. 

Thank You.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to make a long story short, &amp;amp; any advice would be appreciated...&lt;/p&gt;

I should note that ""Michael"" is 18, but everyone else mentioned is 16-17

A lot to unpack here, a lot I don't know. Ok so basically, it started when my friend Jared (name altered) sent a message to our group chat. He said he wanted to fight this guy, Michael (name altered), because he is being physically and mentally abusive to a (girl) friend of Jareds. His messages are generally very cryptic, but he said bruises, unwanted sexual advances, and other things were happening.

Obviously we had to talk Jared down from wanting to fight the guy. But then it gets worse. Another member in the group chat, ""Bobby"", says that his girlfriend told him about her experiences with Michael. Similar story to Jareds friend, unwanted sexual advances, mental bullying(?), inappropriate touching, and other stuff. No bruising or assault that i heard of, but its possible.

Bobby's girlfriend is best friends with Michaels sister. Michaels sister told Bobby's girlfriend about things that have happened with Michael in the past. Apparently at some point Michael got angry at his sister and choked her.

This situation is especially frightening to me because I kind of considered me and Michael cool on some level. I knew him through our local scene for a video game. He's seemed to have a dislike for me for a while now, and I always thought he was sort of a dick.

Michael is leaving Hawaii to go to Australia in a few months, which is a good thing, meaning he will be away from the people hes abusing / abused. But me and my friends talked about it, and we just don't know what we should do, if anything at all.

I mean, Michael is violent right? What happens if he finds out these rumors are going around? Bobby's girlfriend and Jared's friend and Michael's sister didn't tell us they wanted to do anything right? Is it our place? It's definitely an invasion of their privacy to some extent.

I don't think any of us have dealt with something serious like this, so everything sounds scary. We think maybe its best for the girls to separate themselves from Michael. However, thats hard, especially if you're Michael's sister.

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

My sister-in-law's boyfriend had a job interview today at a large retail landscaping company (8 locations plus corporate). Part of his interview was to dig a 2'x2' hole. While doing this task, the interviewer asked him if he had any kids. He replied that he had one on the way. After completing the interview, the locations manager denied his employment, citing that they couldn't hire someone who might have to drop everything to tend to a childbirth. Unfortunately this conversation was not in writing.

&amp;#x200B;

I have browsed r/LegalAdvice for similar issues and it looks like the process is to file an EEOC complaint  through the state for an automatic dual file and wait for direction from their end, be it mediation or a right-to-sue letter.

&amp;#x200B;

First, is this the proper form for filing a complaint?  [https://eo.azgovernor.gov/eo/form/employment-discrimination-complaintintake-questionnaire](https://eo.azgovernor.gov/eo/form/employment-discrimination-complaintintake-questionnaire) 

&amp;#x200B;

Second, is he covered because the job was denied because his girlfriend is pregnant, or is he out of luck because it is not his own pregnancy as the reason his job application was denied, or that they are not married?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all immensely for any insight you may provide.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phoenix Metro Area, AZ&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

First and foremost, sorry if I have this on the wrong flair. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a college student in Ohio who saw a job opportunity working for an employer. He has about 6 employees now, all below 18 other than myself.  It dealt with selling produce.

I was enjoying the job until I did not get a day off and realized it was under the table, and would not get overtime or holiday pay.  I plan on working till my next paycheck(1 week from now) and quit then. We get paid $7 an hour to $8 an hour mattering upon which place we work for the day, but we do get tips. We have no schedule other than being called in the night before. We get no breaks, including those under 18 even though our days vary from 6 to 10 hours long. He had me running supplies in my vehicle, which I then learned shortly afterward,  that I need special insurance to drive for work, and he still wants me to drive even though I told him. The only compensation I get for driving is $10 for what usually ends up being around \~45 miles to 3 different site. He also has us ""clean"" corn to look fresher, peel it for customers, and trim onions even though he does not have a proper food license to do it, according to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

While he has been relatively nice to me, he is also harsh with most of his employees, including screaming over the phone three times in a single night with one employee about not being able to work because they had sports for college, even though the employee stated multiple times throughout the week and in the interview that he would not be able to work on certain days such as the weekends because of sports. He yelled at another employee for only giving a 2-day notice about not being able to come into work because she had to go to her Grandfather's funeral. Another employee who worked last year for him who was 15 at the time, said he was forced to work and was only able to visit his father once last working season due to how often he was called into work.  


Is there anything I can do to report this guy without possibly getting this blown back on me for working for him for around a 3 week period? What can I do to ensure this guy stops being harsh to other employees and practicing shady business tactics?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

I am a freelance MUA, and was expecting an 18lb makeup package, delivered April 28th. Here is a brief summary of what I’m going through. I am a resident of Tucson AZ and am pursuing this case in justice court because the amount I’m after is over $3500. I am representing myself in court, but the defendant was given an attorney by her workplace. A couple months ago I had a package from Anastasia Beverly Hills worth $5,007.50 on its way to me, but it never actually made it. Long story short, FedEx delivered my package to the wrong apartment complex and the leasing consultant in the office of that complex signed for my package, which can be verified with the proof of delivery and her captured signature. Before hand I didn’t even know the package was delivered until I reached out to the company for a tracking number, they sent it over, and I find out my package was delivered 3 weeks ago. I go down to my leasing office and they tell me they don’t have anything addressed to me. I told them about the situation and they said FedEx often will deliver the wrong packages to the wrong complex because there is another apartment complex down the road with a similar address with 1 number difference. (I’m 8601, the other property is 8600)

With the help of google reviews on the property down the road, I was able to verify who signed for my package, the name popped up more than once and matched the signature. I made a phone call to he property, they said they didn’t have my package. My fiancé and I later on go to the property to speak with the person who signed. (A girl my age, around 23-24) when I asked about the package she started becoming nervous and dodging questions concerning the package. (I didn’t tell her yet that the package was delivered 3 weeks ago) upon further questioning she responded with. “We get a lot of packages, I sign for a lot of thing, I may have sent it back.” We asked what carrier she may have sent it back to and she responded with. “I send back misdelivered packages to a lot of carriers.” I asked if there’s any chance they have similar apartment numbers in their community and I was told no, I then asked if she may have handled anything with the Anastasia Beverly Hills logo on the box and she said. “I think I remember, actually I sent it back, yes I sent it back.” I didn’t believe her, but gave her the benefit of the doubt and called a few FedEx stations in my area. They confirmed that the package was indeed delivered, and helped me obtain the address it was delivered to and who signed and it was indeed delivered to the wrong complex and signed for by the girl. They told me if there was any changes, it’d be updated on their site, but there was never any action requested to pick up a package or return to sender in regards to my tracking number.

This time I call the girl at the complex back and told her what FedEx told me. I tell her that the package was delivered 3 weeks ago, explain the value of the package and told her I’d get legal action involved. She got nervous again and put the call on a 4 minute hold then asked “Is legal action really necessary over a package.” I explained to her that she doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation and that I’ll be further escalating the issue. Which I have done and I’m currently going through the process. I filed a police report contacted the company sending the makeup and explained the situation, etc. I’m representing myself and she was given an attorney provided by the complex. Based on the paper work, she denied signing for my package and said she was never in contact with it. She denied dodging questions etc. basically she denied all my claims against her. I have an 8 page invoice of all the products I was supposed to receive, a FedEx communication letter stating the package was confirmed delivered April 28th and that the driver even went back to the complex and spoke with the leasing consultant who relayed to the driver that she doesn’t have logs to log packages in and out of the complex. 

As a freelance MUA all the makeup I was expecting was to be used on my clients, in my Terms in conditions that I give to my clients when they book, I have a statement explaining that I use prestige products for a high end luxurious experience. I was expecting new products/launches to use on my clients but now I can no longer offer that. This has taken a toll on my clientele because now I’ve had to resort back to drug store makeup brands (which isn’t bad, but now I’m no longer up to promised standards)  and this all happened during peak season for me. (Prom, Graduation, Some weddings)

My question is, am I crazy for trying to represent myself in court? It’s 1 tier above small claims but I’m freaking out because it’s 2 against 1. Also how do I prove my loss of income? I normally receive cash via PayPal, Venmo or Cash app when the service is complete. I don’t have a w2 or hourly wage and I don’t have a 1099 tax for either. I only have the screenshots of what I’ve been paid from the apps I use to receive money. I’ve tried getting legal aid but my application was rejected, and I’ve tried searching for law students who may do pro-bono, but no luck there. I even signed up for Legal Shield and the person I was put in touch with was no help at all. So I’m at my wits end and hoping all my efforts are worth it in the end. I even have my fiancé as a witness since they were there in both situations. 

I’d also like to know how I’d go about using the FedEx driver as a witness. I was told I could subpoena them but due to safety reasons, FedEx wouldn’t give me the name of the driver, what would I do in that case?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, I’m currently going through a lawsuit right now and have hit a bump in the road.

I am a resident of Tucson AZ and am pursuing this case in justice court because the amount I’m after is over $3500. I am representing myself in court, but the defendant was given an attorney by her workplace. A couple months ago I had a package from Anastasia Beverly Hills worth $5,007.50 on its way to me, but it never actually made it. Long story short, FedEx delivered my package to the wrong apartment complex and the leasing consultant in the office of that complex signed for my package, which can be verified with the proof of delivery and her captured signature. Before hand I didn’t even know the package was delivered until I reached out to the company for a tracking number, they sent it over, and I find out my package was delivered 3 weeks ago. I go down to my leasing office and they tell me they don’t have anything addressed to me. I told them about the situation and they said FedEx often will deliver the wrong packages to the wrong complex because there is another apartment complex down the road with a similar address with 1 number difference. (I’m 8601, the other property is 8600)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of google reviews on the property down the road, I was able to verify who signed for my package, the name popped up more than once and matched the signature. I made a phone call to he property, they said they didn’t have my package. My fiancé and I later on go to the property to speak with the person who signed. (A girl my age, around 23-24) when I asked about the package she started becoming nervous and dodging questions concerning the package. (I didn’t tell her yet that the package was delivered 3 weeks ago) upon further questioning she responded with. “We get a lot of packages, I sign for a lot of thing, I may have sent it back.” We asked what carrier she may have sent it back to and she responded with. “I send back misdelivered packages to a lot of carriers.” I asked if there’s any chance they have similar apartment numbers in their community and I was told no, I then asked if she may have handled anything with the Anastasia Beverly Hills logo on the box and she said. “I think I remember, actually I sent it back, yes I sent it back.” I didn’t believe her, but gave her the benefit of the doubt and called a few FedEx stations in my area. They confirmed that the package was indeed delivered, and helped me obtain the address it was delivered to and who signed and it was indeed delivered to the wrong complex and signed for by the girl. They told me if there was any changes, it’d be updated on their site, but there was never any action requested to pick up a package or return to sender in regards to my tracking number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I call the girl at the complex back and told her what FedEx told me. I tell her that the package was delivered 3 weeks ago, explain the value of the package and told her I’d get legal action involved. She got nervous again and put the call on a 4 minute hold then asked “Is legal action really necessary over a package.” I explained to her that she doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation and that I’ll be further escalating the issue. Which I have done and I’m currently going through the process. I filed a police report contacted the company sending the makeup and explained the situation, etc. I’m representing myself and she was given an attorney provided by the complex. Based on the paper work, she denied signing for my package and said she was never in contact with it. She denied dodging questions etc. basically she denied all my claims against her. I have an 8 page invoice of all the products I was supposed to receive, a FedEx communication letter stating the package was confirmed delivered April 28th and that the driver even went back to the complex and spoke with the leasing consultant who relayed to the driver that she doesn’t have logs to log packages in and out of the complex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a freelance MUA all the makeup I was expecting was to be used on my clients, in my Terms in conditions that I give to my clients when they book, I have a statement explaining that I use prestige products for a high end luxurious experience. I was expecting new products/launches to use on my clients but now I can no longer offer that. This has taken a toll on my clientele because now I’ve had to resort back to drug store makeup brands (which isn’t bad, but now I’m no longer up to promised standards)  and this all happened during peak season for me. (Prom, Graduation, Some weddings)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, am I crazy for trying to represent myself in court? It’s 1 tier above small claims but I’m freaking out because it’s 2 against 1. Also how do I prove my loss of income? I normally receive cash via PayPal, Venmo or Cash app when the service is complete. I don’t have a w2 or hourly wage and I don’t have a 1099 tax for either. I only have the screenshots of what I’ve been paid from the apps I use to receive money. I’ve tried getting legal aid but my application was rejected, and I’ve tried searching for law students who may do pro-bono, but no luck there. I even signed up for Legal Shield and the person I was put in touch with was no help at all. So I’m at my wits end and hoping all my efforts are worth it in the end. I even have my fiancé as a witness since they were there in both situations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to know how I’d go about using the FedEx driver as a witness. I was told I could subpoena them but due to safety reasons, FedEx wouldn’t give me the name of the driver, what would I do in that case?&lt;/p&gt;

There's a lot to this story.

About 3 years ago, my friend (let's call him Sam) ended up having relations with a girl (we'll call her Ann) while she was still dating someone else. Well, Ann ended up pregnant, and because the person she was seeing was completely incapable of biologically fathering a child, the baby was 100% Sam's.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, Sam is done with Ann, but she's become demanding. Ann likes to drive past Sam's house and job to see if he's home, and when he isn't home, she flips the hell out and starts bombarding Sam with texts demanding to know where he is and who he's with. She messaged friends and family of his in attempts to get information about whether or not he's seeing someone. She goes to his job and watches him while he's at work. She comes over his house whenever she wants with Baby and insists that she must be there in order to for Sam to see his son. Ann pretty much forbids Sam from doing anything and constantly threatens to take Baby and never come back if Sam were to disobey her.

Now this is where it gets worse. Sam has been made to look like he's not Baby's father in everyone's eyes by Ann. Ann plays it off like the father of Baby is the person she was seeing during the time she cheated. (Which, without going into details, is not biologically possible.) Baby is the spitting image of Sam, and Ann has acknowledged that Sam is the father to everyone outside of her ex's circle and her friend circle. Sam wants to get Ann out of his life but still be in Baby's life, but Ann has made it clear that if he were to ever take her legal action against her, she would bring about scathing accusations. Sam said that she's made threats to accuse him of raping her and molesting Baby if he were to ever go through legal actions, so he feels trapped, and with no evidence besides maybe getting a DNA test done that proves Baby is his, Sam isn't sure how to make Ann stay away from him while still being able to see his child.

Any advice? I may have missed some details, but I can answer additional questions to the best of my ability (as an outsider looking into the situation) if needed.

I'm telling the whole story so no important details are left out, though some of it is probably not relevant to my question.    

Due to rain flood damage, we had to have all of our floors and the bottom 12"" of drywall and insulation removed from the entire home (on a concrete slab, no basement).  
Afterward we had a different contractor (insured but not licensed) install new flooring and drywall.  
Side note, homeowner's insurance is paying for absolutely none of this since we don't have flood coverage and aren't in a flood zone.  

We were trusting enough to just assume the contractor would install new insulation in the outer walls, figuring this was common sense. 
Well that wasn't the case with this guy. He installed the drywall without insulating first, and now all of our outer walls have at least the bottom 12"" or so completely uninsulated.  
In his defense we didn't ask for it explicitly (because we never thought we'd have to) and he never stated he would. It honestly just didn't occur to us to explicitly ask for insulation on the outer walls because it seems so obvious; who *wouldn't* get them insulated?   
We were not available to supervise him while the work was being done so it wasn't until after work was completed that we found this out. His price quote didn't get itemized until after the work was done, and at that point we saw that insulation wasn't listed as a material cost.  
(as an aside, we also saw that he did a poor job on the floors and left several large gaps and uneven areas)  

So here's the thing. Is it even legal to leave those walls un-insulated? Did he break the law by doing that? Is my house now not up to code? Is that my responsibility or his?   

I fully understand that I was probably just too trusting and let myself get boned by a shitty contractor here, and I'm probably SOL. But I thought I'd just ask in case there's another angle I'm not considering.

We had no air conditioning for a week, the first 3 days we didnt have hot water, and some days no water at all. We had a broken kitchen window (as in missing the top quarter of the window) until June 26, we had no washer and dryer, ""maintenance"" was smoking in our house the day we moved in, we had no keys to our mailbox, the front or back storm doors for about a week, and our dish washer didn't work for about a week. We didn't hear from our landlord for about 5 days because she was out on a trip and didnt want to use her cell phone. All of those problems have been temporarily fixed. As in her ""maintenance,"" a group of men she's recruited who also live in the complex, have come by and done their best to fix the issues. 

Now as of recently, we have a large leak in our ceiling, our hot water handle in the only shower has fallen off and we've been without hot water in the shower since June 18, we have cockroaches, all of these things have been reported as of July 2 and we haven't heard back from our landlord since. 

We were promised this place would be move in ready, and it's still not. Theres problem after problem and its exhausting and it prevents us from doing our day to day things.

I feel like we've been lied to and taken advantage of because we're young and had to move so quickly. 

How can I get out of this lease, what can I do that won't end in us having to pay a ton of legal fees?

Here's the situation:

Landlord took approx. 60 days to return security deposit which was a list essentially telling me I owe an extra $585 after she kept $2,225 (Security and $500 pet deposit)

Rent was $1800 /month

&amp;#x200B;

List as follows: (After move-out)

Rent for May 2019: $900  (was there an extra 5 days waiting for new home to close)

late monthly payments: $390

Lawn maintenance : $250

Pet droppings: $100

Extensive home cleaning : $400

stove: + $50

refrigerators (2x): +100

broken faucets: $100

multiple broken window clips: $400

SEPTIC CLEAN: $190

water: $300

under half tank of oil: $215

unreplaced light bulbs: $20

&amp;#x200B;

As for the rent in May:  I was there an extra 5 days waiting for my new home to close through the bank.  We had been very polite about letting them showing the house to potential new tenants while we were still living there.  They had not found tenants at the time.

Late payments:  I was personally dropping off checks as well as delivering them their mail that they had not forwarded (sometimes important correspondence that they needed).  They didn't ask me to and usually their mailbox was stuffed full as it had not been checked in weeks.  (How would they know the check was late &amp; if it was, it was only a day or two at most).

Lawn maintenance:  The landlords left a large downed pine tree in the back yard for well over 18 months making full lawn care impossible.  They only removed the tree a few weeks before lease expired (to show to new tenants) but left the cut logs in the middle of the yard.

Pet droppings:  Ok, not many could have been left as i picked up all i could find (no dispute here).

Extensive home cleaning:  nothing but normal wear.  3 clean adults living in the home.  $400 worth of filth????

broken faucets:  NOT TRUE.  nothing was broken. They left us with a funky shower mixing valve that didn't work properly all of the time and the kitchen faucet was never properly tightened and came loose periodically.  Not broken.

Broken window clips:  Not sure what they are talking about.  Not sure what a window clip is but all windows were in perfect working condition when we left.  NO broken glass, etc.

Septic clean:  Am I responsible to pay for them to have the septic tank pumped?  Doesn't seem lawful.

Under half tank of oil:  When moving in, the first thing I had to do was get oil because they left us with almost none.

unreplaced light bulbs:  Seriously?  They were all LED and we didn't ever need to replace them.

&amp;#x200B;

They gave me a $50 credit for replacing a leaky basement faucet that was running all over the floor.  The parts alone were almost $70 and they did not credit me for the labor.  (although her labor for wiping down a fridge was worth $100)

&amp;#x200B;

I did not take any photos or document much as I was moving out quickly.  They did not recommend a walk-through and it wasn't done.  If any more information is needed, please ask.  I'll be happy to share.  Otherwise, am I entitled to take them to small claims court after sending a demand letter?  Please weigh in.

They took my insurance information at my first adjustment and after my second adjustment( a week later) they sat me down and went over my insurance coverage. 

They went over how they are out of my insurance's network and that my out of network deductible is $3300. With my insurance, I pay 100 percent of cost until my deductible is met. Afterwards, for out of network, I pay 50 percent of the cost until I meet the out of pocket maximum. I have currently met $0 out of my out of network deductible.

They explained to me that it would take me about 9 visits (at $60 a visit)  until I would hit my deductible. The total amount I would have to pay out of pocket would be $500. After that $500 is paid my deductible would be met and I would not have to pay any more money out of pocket for any future visits. I didn't understand  how paying $500 would result in me meeting my $3300 deductible. They told me since they are out of network, they have more freedom in how they can charge their patients. 

My question is: Are there legitimate ways  I could only pay $500 and then get free adjustments and massages for the rest of the year through my insurance? Or is the chiropractor performing some sort of insurance fraud?

Does she have any legal basis to sue me for something that happened three years ago? I know she randomly wants money bc she’s mad and there was no contract. I wish I could find old texts where her and her mom offered to let me stay so I’d feel at ease about this but can’t find them bc I’ve switched phones since then.

She says I owe her mom 500+ for hotel costs but I was the third person in the room, wouldn’t she have to split it three ways? So why is it so expensive?

I came in about 13k lower than their asking price but after a bit of negotiations he accepted our offer. The one contingency is that the house is sold as is except anything structural or environmental. I know they legally have to list any known issues on the sellers disclosure which they have stated that we will need a new roof soon, and a leak has caused a small amount of mold in the basement.

Today I spotted my neighbor mowing down a small meadow area I have as part of my landscaping design. He was well into my property by more than 40 feet from the recently surveyed line, so I went over to ask him why he had trespassed onto my property to vandalize my yard. He was on his still running mower as I walked onto his driveway and waved and shouted to get his attention. I never got closer than 80 feet from him as these are large properties. Suddenly he shut down his mower, started screaming at me about not letting him do what he wants, and ran into his house. A minute later he popped out holding an AR-15 and continued shouting, and threatening to kill me. He did not point the weapon at me, but just waved it around.

I called the sheriff's department and a deputy came out, talked to him, and told me there's nothing he can do because it's not illegal to carry a weapon on your own property. He also said neighbor denied the threat to my life and told him he felt threatened by me, despite my being unarmed and standing still so far from him we had to shout. He did file a report and said he'd send to to the prosecutor's office, and recommended I file a criminal order of protection.

Did the deputy inform me accurately? Despite the fact that I was on the neighbor's driveway, it seems like menacing and brandishing charges should be possible. I wanted him arrested but the deputy declined for reasons stated.

1. Is there a way to escalate this brandishing offense within a sheriff's department, and should I try?
2. Without charges, can I even get a criminal order of protection in Ohio? This neighbor has always been unstable and volatile, and after this I feel even more iffy about being outside or letting my dog out into my fenced yard.
3. Failing these remedies, do I have grounds for a civil lawsuit? I don't want him thinking he can brandish a weapon at me again without consequence.

Edit: I understand that video can help with future events, but can anything else be done about what's already happened? I believe he should be facing charges for menacing and brandishing a weapon.

We contacted the dealership we traded the old car in to get the new one and they said their titles department handles it blah blah and that ALL THEY KNOW IS THAT IT WAS SOLD AT AN AUCTION TO ANOTHER SMALLER DEALERSHIP IN ANOTHER CITY. No help at all as to what to do or anything.

See story below:

In May 2017, a large family moved in to the rental house next door. They weren't the first tenants--the ones before them were magical and lovely. It's crucial to note that the neighbor's carport is about 10 feet from my master bedroom window.

This large family basically held a 24/7/365 party under the carport and out in their front yard from the weekend they moved in until I was finally able to locate the owners of the house and email them. This was maybe March of this year. I gave the owner the many police reports I have called in since 2017. The owner said they would talk to the tenants. Since then, the neighbors have been been quiet at night.

Now, they have been having their parties during the day, from about noon until 10 pm. I work from home right now, and they are ridiculously loud. Basically everything they say and do comes right in my window. They smoke pot (it’s legal), they play LOUD music on the carport, they have karaoke contests, they barbecue and grill (and it goes right in my bedroom window). It is largely impossible to use my bedroom or the back half of the house (and parts of the front of the house) when they are outside. And they are ALWAYS OUTSIDE.

Most recently, they had a party on July 3, but managed to mostly pack it up by 10. There were a couple of outbursts but nothing super offensive. Then at 3 am on July 4, someone comes from the back of house, walks up the side of the house, dumps a SHITLOAD of glass bottles into the bin, then beats up on the bin and screams curses about some bitch. This probably lasted 2-3 minutes. It woke up everybody in the house, set off the dogs and freaked out the cats. Besides the fact that they are just obnoxious people, I was worried that there might have been a legit DV issue. I called the police. Again. So later that afternoon, I texted the landlord. I told them what happened and to let me know if they needed anything else.

This is the response I got: ""Ok I’m going there to talk to them on Sat. I’m so sorry I can’t image what this has been like for your family."" Well, talking to them hasn’t really worked. I am so sick of not being able to enjoy living in my own house or relaxing in my bedroom. I have to listen to them yell and whoop and just be generally obnoxious ALL DAY EVERY DAY.

When I was 12, my older sister and I were placed into foster care. My sister and I were appointed a lawyer through the Childrens Aid Society and were not allowed to attend any hearings, only meet with the lawyer to discuss our wishes. 

It quickly became apparent that the Childrens Aid  Society had no intention of letting us return home even though we had two siblings who remained in my mothers care. My mom always had a 'whatever attitude' about things and just didn't care much about fighting the system.

I'm not sure if its relevant, but I haven't spoken or been in contact with my father in 13 years and have no plans to. I do have a relationship with my mom. 

After a couple hearings, both my parents signed there parental rights away. I am 25 now and have never been told exactly what this means. So, my questions are:

1.) Do I have any legal obligation to care for my elderly parents in the future? (A post from a few days ago inspired this question). 

2.) Does my mom have any rights to make medical decisions as usually a parent would if you don't have a spouse?

3.) Does my mom have any rights to fight my will or estate if I ever bother with one?

Basically my question is, can my girlfriend legally throw away my property if it is on her parents property? Or could/would that be destruction of personal property and could I seek legal actions against her if she does it?

So for some more background info, my gf and I basically had a non-verbal and non-written ""agreement"" that I would move in with her at her parents place, and live there for free. And in exchange, I would do most of the house work and would also take care of her dogs. This worked out for us because I had recently lost my job and had no income and she worked and did school full time.

Fast forward to today, where I am currently on a mini-vacation visiting family in another state and today she tells me it's over, and to come get my shit tomorrow and move out. Well the issue is, that I still have other engagements and am unable to return to pick up my things until next week.

So, does she have the right to throw away/destroy my property that is at her parents house or, if she does do it, can I actually seek legal action? Any advice would be great, thanks.

P.S. She lives in NJ, if that matters for anything.

Throwaway due to I don't like personal posts to my main account. Sorry if the title is unclear.

 Location: Cincinnati, Ohio

   So,  me and my friend/roomate are purchasing a house to live in. We are both  single males and are on good terms with each other. The loan for  purchasing the house will be under his name, but we will split all the  bills (mortage, utilites, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

   We were  wanting to have some form of contract between us that verified that  when we sell the house all profits from it would split between us  evenly. Also when one of us wanted to move out we had a time period of  noticing the other and giving time to sell, and find a new place etc.

&amp;#x200B;

   We  don't think we will have an issue with this normally, since we are good  friends and have lived with each other already for years. However, the  future is often unclear and we have no idea how it will affect us, so  both of us agreed having some contract between us. That way when it  comes to one of us wanting to move or sell, we both already have the  groundwork laid out and terms are clear.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We're in a bit of a pickle. In retrospect I can see how this may be suspicious, but I swear there was no mal intent and this is all a huge terrible coincidence. 

I'll use fake names for simplicity. John has a son Dave. Dave is in grad school on the other side of the country trying to buy/rent a new house in an expensive big city and have John move with him. The plan is to sell the house in the midwest and move to New York city. The house needs a lot of work to be sold including a new roof and new appliances etc. John does not have the cash for this, so  John applies for a number of loans. John also files a claim with his insurance to get the roof replaced which costs &gt;12K and hopes to get money from loans to replace appliances and help son Dave put 3 months rent down and moving costs. John also talks to several people about buying the house as is. Different people offer to put money down as earnest money etc. John is expecting money from the insurance for the roof. The next week, John would check his account randomly to see that there was a 20K deposit to his checking account. The wire signature shows that it's from a real estate company. There were a number of loans that he applied to and he didn't necessarily know what source the roof money was coming from or if it would be a check or direct deposit etc. There was a question that maybe this was a deposit from a potential buyer for the house? Unclear source. Dave and John attempt to contact the real estate company which has a legitimate website and phone number. They leave messages with no return. They think, ok this money must be from one of these sources, so it will likely come to light soon. They genuinely think the money was meant for John's account, just not sure what source it was coming from. So John transfers Dave 12K to help with affording the 3 months rent and moving costs and then pays the roof guy for the roof. Talks about selling the house continue and a contract is made to sell the house only to fall apart in a few weeks right at the last second. Now a month has gone by since this deposit and nothing has come of it or been brought to John's attention.  Even so, John and Dave grew suspicious that there could be something fishy going on so they made sure they had 20K in the event that the money wasn't meant for us and had to be paid back. Now a week later John is at the store and his card gets rejected. He calls the bank who tells him his accounts are frozen and there's no information about it because the account was listed as ""restricted"" and he's given a number to call at the fraud department. It seems that John is now being accused of wire fraud. The bank said they had accidentally deposited into John's account which was meant for someone else, they accused John of spending the money and not reporting the transfer and said he's under investigation.

Looking for recommendation on how to proceed. While the deposit was not reported to the bank, it was a deposit that made sense in their situation and they figured if it was something not meant for them they would certainly hear about it. So it wasn't really on the radar to report it to the bank. The money was transferred for honest reasons, to help Dave (son) move to a new city. The money was not actually ever spent because they were waiting to verify its source. Attempts were made to contact the company who made the deposit with no luck. 

They understand where the bank is coming from, but they did not steal any money. The money is readily available to be paid back. They've had an account with this bank for 30 + years. The bank made an incorrect deposit which by some miracle was from a real estate company that buys and sells homes as is, just like the companies we were dealing with. Is there a risk of John being in trouble here? These were convenient accidents on the bank and John's part, and John is fully cooperative to pay the money back. Do you think John could go to prison for this? Should John get an attorney, if so what kind? (John doesn't have money for an attorney anyway). John and Dave are as kind and innocent as they come and would never steal or commit a federal felony such as wire fraud. Just a shitty situation. Looking for advice on how to proceed.

A few weeks ago my door was unlocked and open when I got home despite locking it earlier. I called the police who searched the place and told me to call my landlord in case they entered without notification. Then I contacted my landlord who said they wanted to show my unit to potential renters for the next year. The landlord said they would notify me in the future but keeps failing to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

However instead of the landlord coming to show the unit, a bunch of different housing agents have been stopping by my apartment to show the unit to potential customers and most of them did not provide any prior notification before unlocking and entering my apartment regardless whether I am home or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the need to show the unit and it's reasonable that they do so but the majority of the housing agents didn't provide any notification before entering. It just feels like I have no privacy or security in my own living space which I am still paying for at this point. One housing agent tried to enter while I was still home and when I asked if he provided notification, he lied to me and said he did but when I called him out and asked him for proof, he just ignored me and walked away. It's gotten to the point where I had to install a security camera in my own room to feel secure as many times I have walked back into my apartment with my door unlocked and still open despite locking it when I left. I am not sure if they are legally required to notify me in the state of MA.

Is there anything I can do about this legally? Any advice would be appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been living in an apartment in Boston for the past year now and my lease is coming to an end in about 2 months. A few weeks ago my door was unlocked and open when I got home despite locking it earlier. I called the police who searched the place and told me to call my landlord in case they entered without notification. Then I contacted my landlord who said they wanted to show my unit to potential renters for the next year. The landlord said they would notify me in the future but keeps failing to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However instead of the landlord coming to show the unit, a bunch of different housing agents have been stopping by my apartment to show the unit to potential customers and most of them did not provide any prior notification before unlocking and entering my apartment regardless whether I am home or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the need to show the unit and it&amp;#39;s reasonable that they do so but the majority of the housing agents didn&amp;#39;t provide any notification before entering. It just feels like I have no privacy or security in my own living space which I am still paying for at this point. One housing agent tried to enter while I was still home and when I asked if he provided notification, he lied to me and said he did but when I called him out and asked him for proof, he just ignored me and walked away. It&amp;#39;s gotten to the point where I had to install a security camera in my own room to feel secure as many times I have walked back into my apartment with my door unlocked and still open despite locking it when I left. I am not sure if they are legally required to notify me in the state of MA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything I can do about this legally? Any advice would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

I went out for a walk and to bring back the mail, and found four letters from legal representatives. Coming back home and opening them I found that they were all solicitations for my services. Normally I would have brushed this off, but they all had the same case number written on them. None of these were from the county or a governing entity.

A friend helped me out in finding the correct database with the information on it. There was a new case complaint/petition filed against me, a notice for appearance (or something to do with appearance, the database only says appearance), and a warrant for my arrest, all on the same date (July 2nd).

Apparently the agency bringing the case is a local (but not my city) police department. I don’t know if this means that they’re saying I assaulted an officer, or if the police department is just involved with the case. I have mental health issues (including autism) and have been combative with police officers in the past when they tried to take me inpatient. Usually I’m restrained, sedated, and sent for a week-long stay at whatever mental health facility they so chose.

I never received any documentation until the solicitations— I have two folders full of “important documents” and there’s nothing in there, though I know that doesn’t prove that I didn’t receive them.

I’m scared. I lost my job. I don’t have any money. My only family is across the country and barely speaking to me. I’m crying because I don’t know anyone who can take care of my cat if I get arrested and I’m seriously contemplating ending my life if this goes south.

I recently started having my bite adjusted. I spent over $2,500 on a dental splint and another $1500 on a couple guard adjustments and an injection.
My dentist's license got revoked for at least 5 years and I am not even halfway through the treatment protocol. 
Am I entitled to a refund considering there is no other dental-professional  who uses the splint which means I'm out $4,000 (or my mom is who made the investment so that she could see me get well).
He already owes me more than $7,000 in prepaid undelivered dental treatment.
Over the last month of working with him I watched him become mentally unstable and I'm having difficulties getting back the $7,000 which shouldn't be as hard as he's making it.

I don't even want to ask him because I won't get the truth. He's not the same person he was when I started working with him and it's reached the point that he makes me very uncomfortable/fearful.

I called the manager said I want them back, and he said shadily ""I don't know where they are I already passed them off."" I told him he needs to find them or pay me for them.

The other details are that the house that I was living in was a shit hole. There is no way the house was up to standard. Pipes were falling apart, the circuits were completely (for example microwave wasn't on its own circuit, exposed wires in garage, etc.), and many more health violations (like a boarded up, built-in Jacuzzi in the outside deck that had black still water in it for years, even before we got there). There's no way the property is insured (landlord is in Israel). The reason why we rented it is because we are college kids who needed somewhere cheap to live and we just passed it down to friends every year.

If he doesn't pay or give me my property back, what can/should I do? I'm extremely angry and need some help. Do I have a stance to sue? Do I tell him I can report the property and him in order to get him to pay? I don't think contacting the landlord is the way to go because I don't even  know if he responds to anyone/anything.

It might get a little confusing and I do apologize for it, but I'll try to explain it clearly. I know personal identifying information isn't allowed, but when I'm mentioning something with regards to my birth certificate, I'll put in only one letter for my last name and I'll bold it to try and explain it as best as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, back in 2016, I went through a legal name change at a courthouse to change my last name to my grandfather's last name after he had passed away. My whole life, I grew up with the last name **K** after my mother and grandmother's last maiden last name and in 2016, I had changed my last name over to **B**. Everything went smoothly with the courts, went smoothly with my banking, my social security, my DMV, everything. The issue came up with my birth certificate since I needed to amend it to reflect my new last name. A few days ago, the Vital Records Office sent me back my documents I had sent them and said that the birth certificate they have on record, is not the same one I have had my whole life. They told me that the birth certificate they have on record, is the one under my father's name, with the last name starting with **Z** and told me I needed to have my court document for **B** from **K,** be amended from **Z** to **B**. I called my mother to ask her about it and she told me she had no idea what was going on and actually came with me to the Vital Record Office that was closest to us. I explained to the clerk what happened and they went through their records and told me the exact same thing, that the only birth certificate they have on record, is the one under my father's last name, funnily enough, my sister has the last name that I've had the whole time on my birth certificate that I've seen my whole life. I purchased a copy from them since I didn't have it and we all noticed something on it. The birth certificate that has me under **Z** was dated August/4th/xxxx on my birth date. The birth certificate that is from my mother, that I've had my whole life is dated October/6th/xxxx (same year as my birth date, just 2 months after.) My mother and father were going through a divorce at the time I was due and she elected to not put him on the birth certificate, which they both fought over when he found out, which was backed up by my grandmother and the few uncles and aunts that I keep in contact with. We assumed my father had amended my birth certificate somehow, which erased the name my mother has for me or something? My problem with this, is literally growing up my whole life, I have used the last name of **K** and never had any issues with it. My social security card has been under **K** since I was a baby, when I had to get my California ID and my California Driver License, both needed my birth certificate and both went under **K** no problem. Even when I went to the courthouse to do the last name change that I did to **B**, I brought that same birth certificate under **K** to prove I'm me and it too, went through with no problem, yet somehow, the Vital Records have no record of me ever being under **K**, but my mother has an authenticate birth certificate with that last name. I just don't know how nothing was communicated about my birth certificate being under **Z** this whole time, especially to Social Services from the Vital Records or anything, because then my mother could have known what happened and action could have been taken when I was a child, instead of just finding this all out as an adult.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, with that out of the way, I am planning to go to the courthouse near me to try and figure this out in the middle of the week, I just need some advice on what I should even ask, what to tell them and what to expect. My problem is, the fact that the Vital Records told me I need to amend my court order to reflect the name under my birth certificate. That makes me feel that I'm going to have to somehow tell the people I need to refile a name change, under a name change for a last name (**Z**) that I never had documentation for such as social security or any photo copy IDs and never used in my life, while wanting to change it back to the court order that I did 3 years ago with the last name (**B**) and in my head, that doesn't work. The other option I see, would be to revert my last name of **B**, to **K** (the last name I've had and used since birth on any and all documents,) from **K** to **Z**, then from **Z**, back to **B**, through a total of 3 whole new name changes, which, is very time consuming and will put me out upwards of $1300 for the total of 3 separate cases. I just can't see that being the only option and I'm working myself up with stress trying to figure this out in my head because I don't want to screw up somewhere when at the court house and then messing things up and delaying everything even further than it already has been.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything that I might be missing that will make this easier? Like, since I have both copies of the birth certificates now, if I explain to them the situation, is it possible they'll just have me fill out another form such as NC-100, NC-110, NC-120, NC-130 and then they just attach both names to it, that way the Vital Records will have the matching last names that they need? 

&amp;#x200B;

I again do apologize if this doesn't make much sense, I might be wording it piss poorly because I am just stressing myself out over it, but any help is greatly appreciated. I also do apologize if I used the wrong flair for this. Everything below this sentence is exactly what the Vital Records Office sent me (minus the full discourse of my first and last name.) 

&amp;#x200B;

""The court order submitted does not properly identify the child's/registrant's name. Please contact the court to amend the court order to identify the child's/registrants name as shown on the birth certificate. Altering the court order without going to court invalidates the court order and is unacceptable to register the amendment.""

&amp;#x200B;

""The name on the birth certificate on file with California Department of Public Health is \[blank\] **Z**. Court order must be amended to show that name.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&amp;#39;m kind of having some stress issues with my birth certificate.

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything that I might be missing that will make this easier? Like, since I have both copies of the birth certificates now, if I explain to them the situation, is it possible they&amp;#39;ll just have me fill out another form such as NC-100, NC-110, NC-120, NC-130 and then they just attach both names to it, that way the Vital Records will have the matching last names that they need? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I again do apologize if this doesn&amp;#39;t make much sense, I might be wording it piss poorly because I am just stressing myself out over it, but any help is greatly appreciated. I also do apologize if I used the wrong flair for this. Everything below this sentence is exactly what the Vital Records Office sent me (minus the full discourse of my first and last name.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The court order submitted does not properly identify the child&amp;#39;s/registrant&amp;#39;s name. Please contact the court to amend the court order to identify the child&amp;#39;s/registrants name as shown on the birth certificate. Altering the court order without going to court invalidates the court order and is unacceptable to register the amendment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The name on the birth certificate on file with California Department of Public Health is [blank] &lt;strong&gt;Z&lt;/strong&gt;. Court order must be amended to show that name.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

My lease started 6/26/19, I scheduled a walkthrough with a property manager on 6/27/19. Apparently she came early and did the walkthrough by herself. She told me everything was clean and in working condition. Last year, the same management company (different property manager) did a very thorough walkthrough with me so I was very confused. I didn’t really know how to react so I glanced around and deemed it acceptable. When I started moving in, I noticed that it really wasn’t clean. Not even vacuumed. There were dead bugs on the carpet, the smell of pet urine is slowly returning over time, very dirty windows (garden level, so I didn’t expect them to be spotless). The heat/air system is BOARDED up and I can’t change the filter without drilling screws out and removing a plywood “wall.” Exposed insulation. A makeshift piece of ceiling fell out of place. I found actual cat poop on the walls. Multiple walls. And when I wiped it off, the paint came off with it. It rained the other day and a portion of my living room flooded. They gave me a fan and a dehumidifier to slap a bandaid on the situation. Dirty kitchen.

If anyone can offer any preliminary advice on a civil/domestic/family situation that feels unreal... I will try to be as concise as I can to explain what feels very complicated. If my shorter version is too confusing, I will go back and fill it in. But for now: 

I have been ""looking for"" my estranged father for many, many years. He made no effort to stay in the picture when my mother left him - I was five years old. Today am 41 and he is in his late 60's. My mother immediately took me out of state when they split. He later moved to Washington State where his still lives today. I now reside in the south. My mother has been out of the picture for 15 years. 

Through all of these years, I have been keeping tabs on my estranged dad via the only public records he consistently creates  - legal ones. He has a long history of various liens, tax evasions, evictions, etc. I've seen one legal charge related to having some pot on him while driving without insurance, otherwise his legal history is all just some variety of not paying things - *avoidance*. 

For this and maybe other reasons, he never had a stable address or phone number through the last 20-ish years that I've been tracking him (on my own, couldn't afford a PI most of these years, and he's so elusive, I'm not sure they would do much better than I). It appears he bought some property three years ago; maybe that is why he's producing a lot more documentation now. Believe it or not, I have yet to ever, ever, ever land on a phone number attached to his name that is even actively *connected*. I now have a physical address for him - which is crazy after all these years (!) but I have never held a phone number or an email address that functioned. So it's not like I can just CALL him. Tho, thb, the idea of cold-calling this guy makes me want to have a heart attack. Anyway. 

I'm here bc the nature of his legal issues has changed. In the past year, in my regular internet surveillance,  I uncovered a whole new layer of info about his life. In a series of discoveries that all came close together, I learned that he has several young kids with a woman who has a history of violence, drug addiction and mental illness. 

I've read lengthy and detailed accounts of this woman - all legal documents and transcripts. She, I'll call her Diane, sounds truly terrifying.  I had a short moment of excitement/emotion discovering that I have (several) half-siblings. Now I'm basically just following evidence of how he + she are fucking up more lives and I feel like I should do something. I want to do something. But I don't know if I have options. 

I've been able to confirm that one of the minor children is safe. 100% adopted out of the house with no further contact with either of them. The problem is there is one minor child, I'll call him Billy, he is or up until recently, was in my father's custody. 

Diane and my father were never married. Billy was born 8 years ago. At some point, her custody rights were terminated due to physical abuse and neglect and her inability to stick with a state ordered program for counseling, treatment, etc etc. When Billy was a few years old, my father and Diane broke up, and my father was granted full custody.

After I read a ton of court documents, I managed to get on the phone last summer with a social worker via Washington State CPS and I told her I wanted my name and number put somewhere in the records of both of these children. I thought they were both safe at this point. My initial motivation was simply wanting to know them, if that's a possibility. Or, minimum, being on record somewhere as next of kin, in the event that it is ever needed.  \[Once separated from my father, I had a lot of opportunities he didn't. I've had a lot of formal education, I have a career/lifestyle that is considered solidly successful. In addition, I am unmarried and have no children. I am stable and have far more resources than they do.\]  

Now I know that Billy was recently (some time this year) removed from my father's care by CPS because they discovered that my dad was allowing Diane to have contact with him (Billy/child).  And by that I mean, they discovered my dad and Diane got back together and are living together (or were). I called CPS and gave them my information last week, in light of there being possibly an open case right now. They said: ""We can't tell you if there is a case or if we even recognize any of the names you're giving us (my father, Diane, the child). We can just pass it to the theoretical social worker who would be managing the case -- *IF* a case exists. And then, if they feel like you can be helpful, they will call you."" 

My question -- What else do I do? What can I do? 

Do I keep calling CPS - at least so I can feel sure that my name and number are attached to this file? Even if they never reach out to me? Why wouldn't they call me? When they are moving this child in and out of my father's house to stay with strangers? Is there ANYTHING I can do to help this child? Even if there was a way to help financially - I don't know how I could even find that out.

Do I have legal rights? Honestly, I'm scared to get on Diane's radar. She's not stable, she's violent, she's not being treated for her mental illnesses. I feel like there is some risk to exposing myself to Diane and my father, who at this point, don't know that I'm watching from afar. 

If by any chance anyone with experience with even the personal/emotional side of being the adopted/foster family and being asked if they want to expose their child to long-lost family member reads this and has a perspective to share...I would love to hear. 

Or adopted folk? If you had a long-lost sibling out there but had maybe kinda landed with a foster situation - what, if anything, would you want this person to do....? 

Of course it has occurred to me that I could end up petitioning for custody myself. If that were to be best thing for the child, I would explore that. But I am not in a position to leave the state I live in. And though I have stability and resources, I went through enough in my own upbringing to know the trauma of upheavals and changes - even good ones - is not small. I also know that this child IS already traumatized. 

I just don't know how involved I can and should be. And it's not something I get a chance to talk to many people about.... 

Info? Experience with any aspect of this kind of scenario to share, anyone..?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway account post...

&lt;p&gt;If by any chance anyone with experience with even the personal/emotional side of being the adopted/foster family and being asked if they want to expose their child to long-lost family member reads this and has a perspective to share...I would love to hear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or adopted folk? If you had a long-lost sibling out there but had maybe kinda landed with a foster situation - what, if anything, would you want this person to do....? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it has occurred to me that I could end up petitioning for custody myself. If that were to be best thing for the child, I would explore that. But I am not in a position to leave the state I live in. And though I have stability and resources, I went through enough in my own upbringing to know the trauma of upheavals and changes - even good ones - is not small. I also know that this child IS already traumatized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know how involved I can and should be. And it&amp;#39;s not something I get a chance to talk to many people about.... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Info? Experience with any aspect of this kind of scenario to share, anyone..?&lt;/p&gt;

My sister and I went to surrogates court to become co-administrators of his estate as next of kin (our mother passed nearly 15 years ago). His estate consisted of a small bank account (roughly $3k), several automobiles, and two properties (one in which he lived and another that was practically abandoned for nearly 25 years, both NY state). His debts include nearly $300 in outstanding medical bills related to his cancer treatment.

Both properties are in some form of disrepair and are a small fraction of their market value. We plan to sell the house he had lived in by realtor or auction, although its condition is poor. His other property is a big mess that we aren't clear what our options are.

It's a one and a half bedroom one floor home that hasn't been lived in since 1995. Mold is evident on the ceilings and there looks to be severe foundational issues. It is badly hoarded from floor to ceiling (both from time of living there and additional storage). He had gotten code violations unbeknownst to me and the village is looking to collect. While there this last weekend, a neighbor informed me that a man is squatting in the busted open basement (which opens as a pulldoor from the backyard).

We have contacted an auction house but they have indicated that they would almost certainly be unwilling to sell in current condition as is. We are not interested in investing in this house as the time and money that is required is unlikely to be of value. I live 200+ miles away and have no interest in a sale by owner situation. At this point we are seriously considering forfeiture of property.

We are planning to see an estate attorney soon but was hoping to get some clarity first.

What are my legal options/obligations for this property? If we fail to pay property taxes and a lien is placed on the home, would my sister and I on the hook in any capacity? What is the process of forfeiture? Would this in any way impact my personal credit? How does the squatter affect things?

Mike has installed a secret camera in our patrol car, it is hard wired into the car and the cable is hidden behind the panels. The camera is located in the headrest of the back seat. 

When i came into the office the other day at the start of my work week i noticed a huge meaty memo about how we cant have 3rd party people in our cars or work sites because of confidential information and liability and such. So i called Stan and he said he got in shit because he had another person in the car with him during a patrol. This person worked with our company but was in a different department. Managment said they got him on camera but didnt elaborate. 

Stan and Mike do not get along what so ever. Seems as Mike has a vendetta against Stan. So i did some snooping and found an incident report that was written by Mike to managment saying that he had installed a camera in the car and that Stan had someone else with him in the car and also wasnt doing his patrols correctly. 

So this means we are being filmed without our knowledge or consent and by someone who isnt managment and he also messed with the cars wiring and broke a panel.

The situation:

Around January this year I applied for a summer physics study abroad program.

This was a brand new program however there were summer physics programs like it and we were led to believe that this one would be very much like the others. The syllabus for this program was not available so the best I could do was look at similar program syllabuses to get a feeling of what was going on. This was advertised as a introductory level course that was could count as a replacement of our home university's introductory physics series. None of the promotional material or preparatory sessions ever mentioned anything about the expectation that this particular new course was built around:

&amp;#x200B;

That students were assumed to have completed a year of highschool physics and are comfortable with the basics of waves and mechanics.""

&amp;#x200B;

After I had already arrived in my host country did they show us the syllabus which had this little, but crucial detail. As someone who never studied physics in High School this caused some problems and I had to drop the program.

This of course feels kind of wrong since none of the other universities had this requirement ( I was advised to look at they're syllabuses and there is even a comparison chart of the different programs) and there is no way I could have known that such a thing was present since They did not release the syllabus to us until I actually got here.

Here is the catch though: It's technically not a prerequisite and they have it listed as ""assumed knowledge"" (Idk if this makes a difference or not).

They designed the program with this ""assumed knowledge"" in mind and of course I spent the first two weeks basically living in the library trying to catch up and understand what is going on.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I would have never signed up for this specific program if that detail was made aware to me and would have instead chosen one of the other 4 or 5 summer physics programs that were available to me.

I understand there is a lot of nuance in Law and more information is probably needed but as the situation stands should I even bother seeking legal counsel. If anything I would want the travel abroad office which organized all of this to at least cover the loans that I took out for the program and any dropping costs associated with dropping the program.

I  am trying to find information about my friend(Turkish citizen). He was  staying in America as a tourist and then he went to Russia to renew his  passport in a turkish consulate there and then went missing. Missing as  in noone knows where he is or what happened to him. His phone just  switched off and that was it. That was 13 months ago. I am worries he had been detained and extradited to Turkey.

The  reason for the title of this post is that he had court cases against  him and I remember him showing to me some turkish website where he had  just read about a new court case against him. Can someone direct me to  this website in question?

Do you think this website shows if a court sentence has begun, as in the person has been detained and put in prison?

Also, is there a registry of sorts where you can search about deceased Turkish citizens?

I have his Name, date of birth, and passport number.

I would be extremely grateful for any advice and information on what to do, besides going to a turkish consulate/embassy. I am thinking of doing that eventually if nothing else works..","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello to all,&lt;/p&gt;

For the past 6 months I was living with my parents after moving out from my roommates for financial reasons. Once I moved in their was a vauge verbal agreement that I was going to get healthy physically and financialy. How ever one of my parents asked me about one of the chores they just threw at me that I wasn't really doing but hand no affect on anything house hold related.

She asked me via text after I left for the day and she kept texting and asking me about it. I eventually texted back after I was done doing my errands before work and I finally had enough with their badgering and told them what I was mad about and how I thought several things were unfair.

I come home at about 1 am and one of my parents is sitting outside and before I even noticed they were there they said why are you even here after the text I sent we aruge for awhile and then I say fine I'll get my stuff and leave if that's what you want.

Then my parent says no you will have to take me to court to get it back.

So my quest is do I really need to take my parents to court to get my stuff back. I have invoices for everything that I really need/want back or is their an alternative route I can go.

It had 35k miles on it. It now has 48k. When I bought the car it came with lifetime warranty but has powertrain warranty that expires December this year. I received a recall letter about the fuel purge valve last October- in regards to recall #18s32. I didn’t have it fixed yet because the letter said they wouldn’t have the parts to start repairs until October 2019.

I live in Texas now. My car randomly stalled and died on my way to work 2 weeks ago, 1 hour from my apartment. The check engine light came on. I get my car serviced regularly and on time at Ford dealerships and this had never been a problem before. I had it towed to a Ford dealership near my workplace and asked if they had loaner cars until I get mine fixed. They said no. I tried all the Fords in San Antonio (where I live) and none of the Fords here give out loaner vehicles while cars get worked on, though the dealership I had in Tennessee did. So I had to pay $250 to rent a car while my car was getting repaired so I could have something to drive for work.

I called other Fords to verify this and all said it wS needed. I was never given a second key when I bought the car. I don’t think I should have had to pay for a key, which is a part that is NEEDED for the item under warranty which is under a recall. In the recall letter it states “Ford Motor Company will notify you via mail to schedule a service appointment with your dealer for repairs to be completed *free of charge (parts and labor)*

I called my dealership in Tennessee and they wouldn’t pay for the second key. The dealership here said I had to call Ford Motor Company corporate office. I called Ford and they said they wouldn’t do it because it isn’t under warranty. But when I called the recall line they said to send paperwork to them.

So is Ford responsible for the key charge? And for my rental since it was a recall? I went ahead and paid for the repairs since I need my car badly for work. I kept all receipts and can upload them if needed.

It had 35k miles on it. It now has 48k. When I bought the car it came with lifetime warranty but has powertrain warranty that expires December this year. I received a recall letter about the fuel purge valve last October- in regards to recall #18s32. I didn’t have it fixed yet because the letter said they wouldn’t have the parts to start repairs until October 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Texas now. My car randomly stalled and died on my way to work 2 weeks ago, 1 hour from my apartment. The check engine light came on. I get my car serviced regularly and on time at Ford dealerships and this had never been a problem before. I had it towed to a Ford dealership near my workplace and asked if they had loaner cars until I get mine fixed. They said no. I tried all the Fords in San Antonio (where I live) and none of the Fords here give out loaner vehicles while cars get worked on, though the dealership I had in Tennessee did. So I had to pay $250 to rent a car while my car was getting repaired so I could have something to drive for work. &lt;/p&gt;

Small time retail company he runs selling phones with locations in PA and NJ. Recently the owner caught store manager going to locations, transferring products out which he's allowed to do and never delivering it to the stores.

He has been doing this since August of last year. Unfortunately the POS system has transfer loophole he took advantage of, but all his history and tracks are all there.

My friend is asking advice on if there are lawyers he can hire who can take a fee if they win and not have to pay up front.

He does have videos of about 20 incidents, the phones don't show active on the internal Network but are most likely being sold unlocked which the FBI can easily figure out. He refused to sign any thing and or admit his guilt.

The managers at the locations he transferred phones to all are witnesses who have told us he never came to give them those phones.

Police was reported - they said to wait and they will get a detective assigned to it.  He wanted to reach out to the FBI and/or a lawyer.

A few months ago there was a note on the door from the water company that there was an issue at our place with running water. I called and talked to them to ask what it was about and that i recently had a dripping faucet i had fixed and if it had stopped, they said no it was ongoing. I could only assume it was upstairs and let my landlord know since Willy was out of town. He went and checked it out and said nothing further. 

Fast forward a month and a half ago and someone comes to the door asking to see my parents, I'm confused and he says he is there to check our plumping. He's a building inspector asked to come check it out by Willy's parents due to a large bill, turns out he had hid the fact we had a massive $600 bill for the last quarter. In talking with the guy and Willy it also turns out that Willy's toilet was broken and running constantly and he only recently got it fixed. The inspector says he'd make some calls and since it wasn't intentional he could see if they could get it wiped.

Willy moved out the middle of last month but before hand he was getting super weird about the bills.

I said i didn't know what he was talking about since he never asked for it, and i asked what happened to the giant charges. Turns out Willy had sent a Venmo request for the money and took my not noticing it as refusing to pay it, he also says it looks like things are resolved with the bill. I pay the request and things are okay and Willy moves out later that month.

Hey guys, my mom sold her old car to our neighbors last Friday June 27th and we notified the DMV the next day. Our insurance policy on the car also expired Sunday June 30th.

This Monday July 1st their son hit another car and because he was driving with no license they had the car taken from them.

The car is being charged a daily fee at the impound until someone picks the car up.

We are unaware if the other driver was injured because they refuse to talk to us about it. They are also now no longer taking responsibility for the car and refuse to pick it up.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never had something happen like this before and wasn't even aware this was a thing before now. I'm a F(24) and noticed while exercising a bit of pulling and soreness in that area so I stopped. Figured maybe didn't stretch enough and called it a day. Fine until next morning... when I notice swelling. Freak out a little but decide to think about a solution at work (currently working retail and had a short 5 hr shift). Unfortunately my shift was later in the day and an hour into it I felt it 1000000% getting worse and more painful. To the point that standing was an issue. I didn't want to cause any problems as I'm timid by nature so I powered through it and very painfully drove home. Mom and I went to ER right away. It was immediately identified as a Bartholin's Gland cyst but the ER was busy so I was kept waiting in a room. I get it. They need to prioritize patients. A PA eventually comes in and looks at it and then says, ""I'm getting off work soon but i'm ordering a kit to drain it and the doctor coming in will take care of it right away"". Flash forward 2 hours later it's 11:30 PM and I'm exhausted. Male nurse comes in, addresses my mom, and says...""Hey, you might want to go home because it'll be hours before the doctor has time."" We totally understood. But, at this point we were thinking maybe we BOTH should go home and sleep. Next morning perhaps visit an OBGYN? We let him know this and he tells us to hold on while he tells the doctor. Well, then the doctor comes in and takes a quick peek and says, ""OK, well this isn't ready to be drained. It's too soon. I can't do anything so you can go home."" I'm sent home with a script for 2 antibiotics (Cephalexin and Clindamycin). Obviously very confused because the last person looked and was ordering a kit... I let her know and she says, ""I don't know what to tell you. I'm looking at it now and it isn't ready to be drained.""

Go home. Can't even turn over in bed. SO MUCH PAIN. Next morning go to another ER (didn't really feel happy about the last hospital because there were two very conflicting answers...). This time I'm in there fast as lightning and about to be treated, finally, I hope. A PA tells me she has to inject lidocaine into the vagina to numb the area. Then she's going to make a small incision into my labia minora to then drain the infection out. Not excited to get a shot down there. But, at this point I was in so much pain already. She proceeds and I am in SO MUCH PAIN I am full out sobbing. My mom looks to just make sure the infection is coming out because I asked her to. Nothing but a lot of blood. Mom proceeds to ask why there is no infection coming out. PA says, ""Well we're going to leave open the hole for it to drain out."" I then proceed to faint. Doesn't pack it. Nothing. Just sends me home once I wake up. I'm like alrighty then. Only instruction is to take the antibiotics. 

Overnight more pain and way more swelling. Vaginal area has turned black. Go back to ER (Same ER as last paragraph) in even more pain and mom demands I am hospitalized and that I am not going home until I am properly treated. A doctor comes into ER and injects lidocaine again and I am cut open again right near the other incision (except this time it was on the labia majora). Ask mom to look to make sure infection comes out....only blood. Doctor proceeds to start packing my oozing bloody wound and mom is starting to get furious. ""Why are you packing an open wound if you haven't even reached the gland in question and haven't gotten any of the infection out? She still is swollen and none of the pressure has been released?"". Doctor freezes and will not answer and then leaves the room. No one comes in for 20 minutes and suddenly an OBGYN enters. Bless up another one. Instantly sees where I have been cut and the packing and says, ""Why is she cut HERE and why is it PACKED?"" No answer. Removes it. I am given a hospital room with the hope of him coming back later on. 

In my own room I am given an icepack to stick on it. Hours pass and he comes back wondering why on earth I have an icepack. I ask what on earth he means and he says, ""I told them specifically to give you sitz baths and hot compresses...We need the cyst to organize so I can treat it."" Nurses scramble to gather these things. He explains the next morning I am going to be discharged and go immediately to his practice so he can properly treat it. Overjoyed I will finally be treated after so long. Awoken hourly that night for sitz bath and hot compress.

Next morning ready to be discharged! Just taking a shower and then signing the papers for release. Ask to take out IV so I can actually shower properly. They explain they cannot take it out. Very confused but comply since I am beyond exhausted and in too much pain to argue. Shower and then they immediately take it out... alrighty then. Go to his office and skip forward to me on the table ready to be treated. He explains that in order to actually handle this I am going to be injected with lidocaine, he will make an incision INSIDE the vagina towards the gland, the incision will actually be a permanent hole to the gland so if this happens again it will just drain out, he will drain it all, feel for pockets inside of infection, and then stitch the hole so it heals over. Mom asks why on earth I was cut outside the vagina two times and then a doctor packed an open bloody wound as though they had gotten it. He could not answer but apologized profusely that this all happened (clearly not his fault). He does his thing and I am FINALLY treated. All infection comes out and I feel instant relief.

I can't help but feel though that the other doctor's and PA's had no idea what they were doing and just blindly cut me open. The pain I went through the previous two times was so much worse than what he did and it wasn't even necessary? If they were unsure couldn't they have just called an Obgyn immediately? Then that one doctor that claimed ""it's too early and can't be drained"". The Obgyn literally had it organized and ready to drain after a few hours of hot compresses and sitz baths... I suffered so much pain for no reason. I mean to the point the bruising has turned the entire area black.

My grandfather set up a trust that my father (and descendants) was a beneficiary of. My father died before my grandfather, but before that he came to me and told me the trust had been amended in such a way that I would receive a large portion of it, but I can't remember the details.

My friends and I are in our twenties. The youngest being 20 and the oldest being 23. About fifteen to twenty of us were in a park across the street from my house having a barbecue on the fourth of July. After we had moved all of our belongings back to the house, we decided to go back across the street to the park so we could make sure we had cleaned everything up. There were a group of roughly fifteen teenagers having a roman candle fight in the park, but they were a good distance away so we paid them no mind. 

They started shooting roman candles at us which we thought was in good fun as it was the fourth of July, and they couldn't have been more than seventeen. Things began to escalate as the started throwing artillery shells at us, which can be pretty nasty if you're up close to them. We yelled at them to stop, because it was getting pretty dangerous, as they started throwing them more and more frequently. One of the blasts from the shells hit our friend in the face, causing a decently sized burn on her cheek. My friends and I approached them, yelling for them to stop. Our friend was in tears as she was being walked back to the house. Their response was to drop an artillery shell at our feet and run. After that interaction, we began to walk back towards our house, where they were throwing increasingly large fireworks at us, causing blasts so loud, it cause my ears to ring. They began to throw artillery shells at our cars, which were parked in a public street adjacent to our house. As they got closer we yelled at them to watch our cars, which didn't sit well with them. They approached our group, (15-20) en masse squared up and ready to fight. They began to taunt us and tried to goad us into fighting them. We kept retreating back to our front porch where we kept trying to tell them to leave. Without any luck they began to shoot fireworks at us once more, eventually throwing an artillery shell into our house, burning a good chunk our of our carpet. The started punching several members of our group, going so far as to hop onto the ledge of our porch, grabbing my friend by his shirt, pulling him through the railing of our porch, causing the railing to break, before punching him repeatedly. Our friend who was hit with the firework had called the police, and as we all filed inside to get away from the twenty or thirty assembled teenagers, they began to throw rocks from our garden at our windows. They broke one of our windows, and took off as the officer arrived. We filed a police report for vandalism, and nursed our friend who had received the beating. The officer did not interview the friend who was assaulted, only myself and my other roommates who lived there who were calm enough to give a statement. The officer took pictures of our window, our destroyed porch, and the roasted carpet. He gave us his card and left.

Last night, my roommate and one of our friends were on our porch around 3 AM, having a late night beer as they noticed a silver car making laps around the block, slowing down as they passed our house. 

This evening, as my other roommate was leaving to go to a friend's house, he saw the same car filled with the guys from the fourth sitting outside our house, watching it. They watched him get into his car, not moving. My roommate did a lap around the block, circling back to the house, and the car was gone.

 This evening, I had stopped by the house to talk to my roommates about what they had been seeing, when a black sedan started making loops around the house. 

Now, this is not unlike a previous event that had happened at my roommates previous residence, before we had moved in together. They were having a party when large groups of teenagers had arrived uninvited. Upon attempt to remove them from the party, the group became violent and assaulted them. 

Now, one of our friends knows someone who had posted a time and date on their social media regarding the park across the street from our house, showing a good amount of fireworks; establishing a connection and giving us a name. 

We've contacted the police, asking them to have someone watch our house, but due to short staff, the best they can do is have someone patrolling the neighborhood. We've begun to fear that we're being cased for a robbery or other crime. We've started documenting when suspicious activities are happening around our street, when we start seeing something making rounds, or see familiar faces from the fourth. Our landlady was made aware of the fact that we were jumped, and has already contacted the insurance thanks to the case number from the police. The damages are taken care of, and the house will be repaired. Right now, we're just worried for our personal safety, and the safety of our neighbors. We live in a triplex with another gentleman and a single mother of three children. We don't want any of them getting wrapped up in this mess, because of some random fight. 

Legally, what can we do to make sure that in the event of a break in, we can defend ourselves to the best of our ability, and to protect those who share the house with us?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bit of a long story tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends and I are in our twenties. The youngest being 20 and the oldest being 23. About fifteen to twenty of us were in a park across the street from my house having a barbecue on the fourth of July. After we had moved all of our belongings back to the house, we decided to go back across the street to the park so we could make sure we had cleaned everything up. There were a group of roughly fifteen teenagers having a roman candle fight in the park, but they were a good distance away so we paid them no mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They started shooting roman candles at us which we thought was in good fun as it was the fourth of July, and they couldn&amp;#39;t have been more than seventeen. Things began to escalate as the started throwing artillery shells at us, which can be pretty nasty if you&amp;#39;re up close to them. We yelled at them to stop, because it was getting pretty dangerous, as they started throwing them more and more frequently. One of the blasts from the shells hit our friend in the face, causing a decently sized burn on her cheek. My friends and I approached them, yelling for them to stop. Our friend was in tears as she was being walked back to the house. Their response was to drop an artillery shell at our feet and run. After that interaction, we began to walk back towards our house, where they were throwing increasingly large fireworks at us, causing blasts so loud, it cause my ears to ring. They began to throw artillery shells at our cars, which were parked in a public street adjacent to our house. As they got closer we yelled at them to watch our cars, which didn&amp;#39;t sit well with them. They approached our group, (15-20) en masse squared up and ready to fight. They began to taunt us and tried to goad us into fighting them. We kept retreating back to our front porch where we kept trying to tell them to leave. Without any luck they began to shoot fireworks at us once more, eventually throwing an artillery shell into our house, burning a good chunk our of our carpet. The started punching several members of our group, going so far as to hop onto the ledge of our porch, grabbing my friend by his shirt, pulling him through the railing of our porch, causing the railing to break, before punching him repeatedly. Our friend who was hit with the firework had called the police, and as we all filed inside to get away from the twenty or thirty assembled teenagers, they began to throw rocks from our garden at our windows. They broke one of our windows, and took off as the officer arrived. We filed a police report for vandalism, and nursed our friend who had received the beating.

Recap of my situation:I am 1 of 2 people renting a two bedroom unit, both on the lease, aka jointly and severally liable.

Thus in August 2018 we split first and last month's rent of $1400.00

As of about November it was clear things were not working, but I stayed on paying rent and spent 1-2 days a week there and the rest at my partners. My roommate was going through a lot of family issues, mental illness, drinking and drug use related stuff that created a lot of the problems in the house, but who was I to claim these issues weren't beyond her control. I believed they were, I tried to be supportive. We were friends.

However, at the start of April we discussed not resigning amicably, I tried to be extremely accommodating including moving out early so that her parents could move in to be more support to her.

At the end of April we were planning to arrange them as my sublets beginning in May or June, they decided / preferred to just have her as the lease holder and pay half the rent to her. I paid May rent, our landlord was apart of various conversations in order to potentially sublet, then not sublet, assign, not assign, and finally just remove me from the lease.I was fine to be removed from the lease in order for her parents and her to get what they want, so long as I was refunded my LMR share.

In order to give 60 days notice, I inquired about an N11 form - my landlord refused as that would end the whole tenancy, but provided us a form that stated I was removed from the tenancy as of May 31st. That accounted for 30 days not 60. We signed it. I did not get my half of the LMR back from my landlord because it is the one lease's LMR, so to them it does not matter that each tenant paid half.

My landlord stated that the LMR deposit would remains on until the unit gives 60 days notice, and it will be applied to the final month.

Because I did not get to use my share of the LMR, my roommate stated she understood it is owed to me it as I won't be living there whenever she does decide to move out (she is month to month as of August 1st, so it could be 6 months, next year, who knows...)

When I moved out at the end of May, she told me she would get back to me in a week or two and then blocked me. Her parents did not ever move in, I'm not sure if they ever were or if they were just trying to get me to break my lease early - which I believe the form - stating my tenancy ended May 31st after only 30 days - is breaking my lease early. Maybe so that they don't have to pay me or something, I don't see any good reason for any of this.

I consulted LTB and they said I should consult legal aid. I left a message with a legal clinic stating I need LTB specific legal advice and my call has been unreturned.

It has been 4 weeks now that my roommate has not contacted me back to pay me my $700.00

I am unsure if my signature on file giving 'insufficien't notice protects my landlord / my roommate from refunding my half of the LMR, or if that can even mean I don't deserve my share of the rent back that I never got to use. This should not be this illogical. I paid LMR, did not get to use it, it should be owed back to me, with the designated annual interest added.

I am afraid to send a demand letter to my roommate through small claims because of the form on file showing 30 days notice rather than 60. The LTB has been unhelpful in advising me in general.

Anyyyyy one have similar experiences / clear advice on how to proceed?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location - Ontario Canada&lt;/p&gt;

My store is a husband and wife team. We have a physical location as well as a mobile trailer that they park at the beach in the summertime to serve beach goers. 

Recently they began to take tips from the tip pool while working the trailer. This is the first year they have ever done this. I believe the wife is on payroll as an hourly employee as she has recently stated she just began getting paid for her work and she had a physical paycheck. Her husband is not hourly.

$800 is loss of sales for not opening the restaurant in time and another $5,000 for unfulfilled delivery orders and having to pay other staff that showed up like the chefs.

I have a text message saved from a coworker that was there and said they were slow.

Also, I never said anything bad about her restaurant online.

She also wrote this about me

""She has been stalking us continuously in her attempt to sabotage our restaurant. As a result, we have retained a counsel to pursue legal action against her for defamation of character and libel.""

She continues to write this

""I claim $5,800 in damages in small claims court, but she caused us even more damages in terms of bad mouthing us to our former and current employees as well a customers""

For some more context, I am an international student so I travel back and forth between the UK and my home country on breaks, and SO is English. It is of course super generous and very kind of him and his fiancèe letting us stay here and all(we do pay rent), however FIL has some disposable income that he wanted to invest in properties. And so he went and bought a house IN SO'S NAME(on the deed), as a way to dodge council tax(remember, SO is a student). He initially wanted to rent this property out to someone for some extra cash, however as things have gotten tense in the house he suggested SO and me move into it and pay rent to him while living there.

Now my problem with this is that whenever FIL is a tad bit annoyed he threatens with just renting it out to someone else instead(practically making me and SO homeless as it's expected we're moving out regardless). Me and SO have been helping with doing up this house, stripping wallpaper, painting, ripping up floors and laying down floors as well as some moving of furniture for the kitchen. This has been going on for about two months now, with usually one day break every 9 days(7.5h work days usually) as we are trying to get this house done before the school year starts. Like I said, FIL threatens to rent this out when he is annoyed, and he gets annoyed when we want ONE day off from dong up the house(basically threatening me with homelessness here).

We’re just losing so much money because he has been on over time for two years now but currently isn’t getting over time or even 80 hour paychecks.

I was wondering if anyone was familiar with youtube copyright issues regarding uploading videos of longplays and non commentary video game footage. I just want to upload some retro game footage (mostly nintendo and sony platforms) but I've heard some horror stories regarding nintendo demonetizing YTers.

This article explains it best, that apparently nintendo has slightly scaled back on their strict guidelines but there are still rules to follow. That videos must have ""your own unique commentary or creative input"" whatever that second point means...

Has anyone here received a copyright infringement notice from Nintendo or any other developers before? And is there really no way around this for a channel focusing purely on non-commentary gameplay? I mean there are 100k+ sub channels out there like World of Longplays that upload copious amounts of Nintendo content without any copyright disclaimers. Is it really just a dart game who Nintendo chooses to copyright?

Thanks for your inputs!

My husband and I bought a pickup truck earlier this year through a personal sale, an old one (1994) and we do have a signed bill of sale with the VIN for the vehicle, albeit a handwritten one. When attempting to get the vehicle title transferred and the car registered about a month later, we were informed that the title in our possession that was signed over to us was the ""original title"" but the original owner had previously applied for a lost title and was issued a secondary one, meaning to have the title transferred, we actually needed the newer secondary title.

Here's where things got tricky. We went back to the guy we bought the truck from, and he claims he doesn't have it and only had the original title, as he never registered the truck and didn't know it had been issued a secondary title. He said he would check with the guy that sold it to him about a year before, and same story. It seems this thing has just been passed around from person to person without being registered and now we have no clue who the actual titled owner of this car is.

So now, we're basically victims of title jumping because we just wanted to buy an old beat up truck to do some construction hauling.

We would really like to get this resolved and be able to get the vehicle titled in our names and have it registered and properly insured. Can we apply for a bonded title and what are our chances of being successful with going this route? If we can't or won't be successful, what should we do with a vehicle we don't legally own and can't legally drive on the road?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all.&lt;/p&gt;

The age and shape of the wooden picketts are consistent perpendicular to the fence line to his garage and to the sidewalk entering his back yard. 

Because of other reasons, I know the fence does not meet city code. However, enforcement of code violations are weak and most basic repair is often considered sufficient. 

A little time ago I saw the owners father out working and asked if they had plans to fix the fence. The father said it was an eyesore and was going to ask if I wanted help fixing it. I pointed out the 4x4s were on his side and the picketts were consistent in his (son's) yard. It was was a cordial and kind exchange and I asked of they'd want me to split the cost of a new fence, or find a way to split the costs of materials and labor and do it ourselves. When I saw him next the response was that the home owner had no plans to repair or remove the fence.

My limited research in to code, at least state wide, is that you can't have a second fence within 6 or 12"" even if it's on your own property. When they said they had no plans I saw the owners father again a few days after and raised my concern. There are large, playful dogs in my backyard and the last thing I need is one to jump through the fence. Yes, it's that bad. A 6' wood privacy fence that will sway 3-6"" in each direction with a strong wind.

I raised the concern with the homeowners father and he spoke to his son once more. The response was that I could remove his fencing, use the existing 4x4s and attach fencing sections in any direction I chose, the 4x4s could be east (his side) or west (my side) or I could place new 4x4s if I wanted.

This has all been verbal communication without the owner. At the very least before using his 4x4s I wanted to get some sort of recorded correspondence, preferably in writing. Even then, I'm worried if I replace his fencing sections and say his little dog gets out or injured due to a failure in the fence, I could be considered liable since I fixed his fence.

I don't want to be calling code to enforcement, I don't think I should be touching his fence and I would feel more comfortable if that fence was actually secure. My offers to share the cost of his repairs have been rebuffed and I'm not comfortable with the proxy offer of removing his fence and building my own but I'm unsure how to proceed with both future legal protection for myself and at least trying to be civil in how to move the issue forward.

The company  (husband wife, small hotel) actually had their business license revoked in 2011 and are operating under an assumed identity in the states website. (They do business as an LLC (writing checks etc).  However in the state website they are operating under a business license from an ABA which turns out to be a strata license from an Australian corporation.  This happened in the business register about a month after the owner was charged with running a large marijuana growing operation and was forced to sell the land the hotel is located on.  The “owner” of the hotel is a felon possessing firearms; as well as employing undocumented immigrants to this day I believe.


They were extremely nice right away (honeymoon) ; and offered us a camphost job for the summer.  The job tasks included in the written contract specified taking reservations, assisting guests, maintenance of the lawn,  watering plants, answering phones, and nothing else) 

We did all of this work, we worked our butts  off 12-16 hours daily .  We left them with all of our work we did related to reservations in paper form.  We did not take any information when we left; we are a couple with good hearts who were trying our best and did a darn good job.  I even left them with a digital backup of everything I recorded in square POS. Square POS is registered under their email. They have access and passwords. Not myself.   I turned everything over to them.  Literally every record electronic or paper. 

Prior to signing on as Camphosts; they asked me to develop a website for them.   I did this; as well as keeping records for reservations and managing an online reservation system, a ton of extra work over and above the job scope.  

this business had made no profit in 7 years.  By the time we decided to leave due to discovering the owners shady past as well as being called their slaves etc.  we did all this work out of the good of our hearts and wanted to turn an unsuccessful business around.  When we left they were bringing in about $2,000 profit daily running at full occupancy most of the time.

After we moved we started to receive negative messages from the “owners.” Regarding the website work I had been doing daily to promote the business.  They wanted me to keep maintaining it without pay because they are like 80 years old.  As they were trying to give us a bad name and because they never paid me for my web development work (which consumed at least 4 hours a day every day.). I was happy to do this for free during my employment with them although it was never specified as duties in the job contract.  

Fast forward;  I have a lot of web client; I own the hosting services; the people threatening us own their domain and still do. I have not asked them for any money; I have explained a breakdown of what the unpaid development costs amount to.  But was very civil and let them know I was not expecting payment or asking.  Simply explaining the hours. After enough harassment about a job I no longer worked for; I quit helping them and delinked the domain from my host.  I never touched any accounts belonging to them after separation from employment.  We also gave them all customer data as well upon separation.  I have no use for anyone else’s credit card number and have worked for a number of Fortune 500 companies so protecting customer data was and is always extremely important. 

The website is backed up and I’m thinking I’ll just transfer ownership and cut my losses.  

However I’m wondering how the following accusations can be true since all accounts/passwords/reservation data/ etc was handed over to them before we left.  Unlinking the domain due to non payment from my web host was the only action taken by myself. I blocked their numbers and never wanted to see them again.  They were the most manipulative and insane people I’ve ever gotten the pleasure of meeting. 

This morning I woke up to a nice message in my email.  (It’s verbatim; the spelling is strange) from the former employer. 

——-start of email———
Considering that the employment relationship ended and verifying that at the end of this, (web developer) withdrew our web page, confidential information of clients, reservations, payment methods are made aware that if in 48 hours after this mail not all of platforms that belong to our hotel are activated , will be processed in the accusation on the following charges:
-Extortion
 -Fraud
 -Wrong criminal deception
-Theef of internet property
-Conspiracy
 
 With up to 12 years of jail.

(names of the “owners” or previous employer) 

————end of email——-

Is this anything I need to take seriously?  I Freelance and have a very successful background in turning business’ around. 

I understand anyone can sue anyone for anything.  I’m planning on transferring host ownership as we speak to try mitigate fallout and just suck up the $4000 they owe me.

How the heck can they accuse me of this ludicrous stuff like extortion, Fraud, criminal deception, theft of internet property (my intellectual property?) and conspiracy for what?

Like I said I unlinked a domain from my host.  No customer information was retained by myself, and was all given to them before we left.  The website development work was a verbal agreement; I wasn’t paid for this but don’t really care at this point.

Is this bogus or serious? Any advice would be helpful how or if I should I respond to this email? Talk to a lawyer? I’m not sure.  I am sure that i want no criminal record especially considering I’ve done nothing regarding the baseless accusations I’ve been hit with.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backstory; myself and partner moved to run a hotel in the United States.

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward;  I have a lot of web client; I own the hosting services; the people threatening us own their domain and still do. I have not asked them for any money; I have explained a breakdown of what the unpaid development costs amount to.  But was very civil and let them know I was not expecting payment or asking.  Simply explaining the hours. After enough harassment about a job I no longer worked for; I quit helping them and delinked the domain from my host.  I never touched any accounts belonging to them after separation from employment.  We also gave them all customer data as well upon separation.  I have no use for anyone else’s credit card number and have worked for a number of Fortune 500 companies so protecting customer data was and is always extremely important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website is backed up and I’m thinking I’ll just transfer ownership and cut my losses.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I’m wondering how the following accusations can be true since all accounts/passwords/reservation data/ etc was handed over to them before we left.  Unlinking the domain due to non payment from my web host was the only action taken by myself. I blocked their numbers and never wanted to see them again.  They were the most manipulative and insane people I’ve ever gotten the pleasure of meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke up to a nice message in my email.  (It’s verbatim; the spelling is strange) from the former employer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;——-start of email———
Considering that the employment relationship ended and verifying that at the end of this, (web developer) withdrew our web page, confidential information of clients, reservations, payment methods are made aware that if in 48 hours after this mail not all of platforms that belong to our hotel are activated , will be processed in the accusation on the following charges:
-Extortion
 -Fraud
 -Wrong criminal deception
-Theef of internet property
-Conspiracy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With up to 12 years of jail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(names of the “owners” or previous employer) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;————end of email——-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this anything I need to take seriously?  I Freelance and have a very successful background in turning business’ around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand anyone can sue anyone for anything.  I’m planning on transferring host ownership as we speak to try mitigate fallout and just suck up the $4000 they owe me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the heck can they accuse me of this ludicrous stuff like extortion, Fraud, criminal deception, theft of internet property (my intellectual property?) and conspiracy for what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said I unlinked a domain from my host.  No customer information was retained by myself, and was all given to them before we left.  The website development work was a verbal agreement; I wasn’t paid for this but don’t really care at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this bogus or serious? Any advice would be helpful how or if I should I respond to this email? Talk to a lawyer? I’m not sure.  I am sure that i want no criminal record especially considering I’ve done nothing regarding the baseless accusations I’ve been hit with.&lt;/p&gt;

So my grandmother-in-law passed one week ago. Only assets are her home, land, 2 cars, very little debt, 1 car is not paid for. We found out, after my aunt in law had her son go into the house to steal her safe hours after her passing, that the aunt in law (who lives at least 18hrs away) is the executor (yet my FIL hasn't seen the will, but the cops she brought to get stuff from the house attested that she was EOTE) and it hadn't been updated since before the passing of my grandfather in law and another aunt in law passed, so ~8 years or so. My FIL has lived at the house in an attached apartment for 9.5 years. Yesterday (the day of the viewing) aunt had phone and internet canceled. Today, the day she was buried, 5 hrs after, she had the power turned off. We are currently trying to deal with that.

This all stems from, on her deathbed, GIL said she wanted FIL to have the house for 20 years (with 5 witnesses). Aunt, upon hearing this, lost her shit as she was now hoping the untimely loss of her mother would pay for her upcoming 2nd (maybe 3rd?) Wedding. 

When aunt found out, after stealing and the breaking into the safe, that she was executor, she basically said, in text, to FIL, that if he brings up the house, will, or the very fact GIL is dying, or even get emotional, she would make sure he doesn't get the house, or anything.

The shit topper on the crap cake, she didnt ask my wife to be included on contributions for a reading at the funeral. She also left me out on listed family on obit cause I mentioned the house before she lost her shit to GIl

Do we have any recourse? This shit is killing my wife and her dad, and I feel so powerless.

Well, I tried to create a topic in another forum about this subject (this I suppose that 2 weeks ago) but I don't know if my topic will be approved. Okay, let's get started.

I'm writing a new book (an e-book that I intend to sell), about the car market in US (as a kind of informative guide), where I explain how the market is (the target audience is Brazilian people, since I'm Brazilian too) and, for example, when I divided by categories (compact cars, midsize, etc...) I thought in using images from Wikipedia. But I gave up and used my own photos that I took during my walks here in Florida ([like this for example](https://i.imgur.com/7x9Uuqd.jpg)). In each category, I described and as example I wrote something like ""Honda exists here since 1970s \[...\] For example: Honda Accord, etc..."". 

And when I started to describe each automaker here in US, I put the logos from [this site](https://www.carlogos.org/Car-Logos/). For example ""Fiat: \*puts the Fiat logo and describes some models and something else"". Well, I suppose that is not allowed to do this. If indeed not, what should I do related to this book? Is possible to adjust this for copyright or would be better in giving up the project?

In case of any confusion in my text please let me know.

Hi. im turning 19 in a few weeks and in the process of becoming an adult. during the process ive came to the realization my mom has royally fucked me over. she used my social/name to get internet in my name and god only knows what else. i cant see my credit because she even went as far to make an account for “me” on the website creditkarma. i cant access “my” account because its under her fucking email. literally what the fuck. im the only one of her kids so far to get their own place &amp; not completely fuck up my life. 

so she probably thought id be like my sorry ass siblings, which to the contrary, im not going to be. i went to my local internet provider and got that shit shut off. but without pressing charges, which i definitely fucking shouldve, i just couldnt do it. im now forced to pay 350 dollars in late fees to put it into my new place. Lucky me. 

I contacted creditkarma to hopefully prove my identity and to see the damage shes done to me.

Went to her house in assist with the police to make sure she wouldnt put her hands on me and got the equipment from her house to shut it off and give me time to pay off the fees. hopefully that was enough to scare her into knowing im not playing about my future/credit.. and also as a warning.

what I need help with, how the hell can i keep her off of my name/credit? what are precautions i can take? I heard about freezing my credit and putting a fraud alert on it, but i called transunion and couldnt for the life of me understand one thing he was saying to me.
i just need help. im learning how credit/life works all at once. i just need advice on how to protect myself. and possibly any information as to when creditkarma will reply to my email about fraud and hopefully get into my OWN account. 

thank you

He said the she accepted MoneyPak (and some other card similar) Once he paid $150 he said that he only owed $1800 instead. 
My guy has been working two jobs to pay this off over the summer, he has already sent over $500 but he doesn’t know what to do. Can he contact the police without getting fucked himself? Is it really just a scam and just block and ignore all contact? After doing some research it looks like this is a common scam now but what can he really do?&lt;/p&gt;

friend was evicted from previous official place, kicked out of their SO's(s) houses/apartments etc, 

wife and I offered a place for friend and kids to stay while they find a place (no lease agreement, no rental contracts, no enforced rent payments but they did willfully compensate for watching kids etc., irregular compensation made directly to my wife, not the landlord) 

friend brought cats that have caused small property damage, landlord (verbal agreement wife and I only) stated no cats and gave us permission to tell them to move out (they were not part of the decision to allow friend to stay here in the first place). 

Verbal terms before allowing her to stay were that there would be regular monthly check-ins where we were updated on status of finding another place, funds saved and plan to move out etc. never happened even once. 

no agreement or request for rent but friend proactively offered the compensation for watching kids, friend called it rent but we did not, we said ""we don't need to charge rent but really we just want to allow you an opportunity to get back on your feet, rather than pay us 'x' just work on saving up and compensation for watching kids is between you and wife""

&amp;#x200B;

If you would be so kind as to answer a few questions I would greatly appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

1) is friend a subtenant by legal definition in Idaho? i looked through the statues to the best of my ability and could not come to a conclusion about that, i believe because we did not charge 'rent' do not refer to her as a 'renter' or 'tenant' but rather offered a temporary (which was made abundantly clear from the start) place to stay, I'd air on the side of no.

&amp;#x200B;

2) given (1) a notice they are not welcome anymore and must move out by the end of the month was delivered by text from wife at the request of the landlords, but cats must leave immediately. Is this sufficient? (friend is not here hardly ever and therefor does not take care of the cats more than once a week, when wife and i agreed to cats it was made clear that we were not going to take care of them in any way and friend was solely responsible for care of the cats)

&amp;#x200B;

3) wife moved friend's stuff into one of the two spare rooms to recover our items such as the bed and furniture, friend is threatening to get law enforcement involved for touching her stuff (not likely, friend's made empty threats like this to all the other bridges they've burned) this seems like an absurd shot in the dark, please advise on our ability or lack thereof to reasonably relocate items under the intent to assist in them leaving and to clean the house and protect furniture.

&amp;#x200B;

4) we have taken inventory of our items, and the current condition of the property with photos etc. to enable prosecution of damages if friend goes nuts, friend was notified this morning and has not been here for a week. Are these photos sufficient in the event something is damaged or stolen and we wish to prosecute with help from the landlord?

&amp;#x200B;

5) If the case is such that they are not a subtenant by legal definition, or reasonable interpretation, are any official eviction forms still required to be submitted or is it generally just a good idea? could submitting such a form serve as the landlords officially recognizing friend as a subtenant? I do not want to submit forms if the latter could be true, as it is now wife and I (tenants) and landlords to not recognize friend as a tenant and landlords have not made any contact or agreements with friend, nor have they received, accepted, or given us permission to require rent or compensation on their behalf or otherwise.

Background:

* I ran a marketing agency company with a business partner. Over the last year, things have been rough, alot of disagreements
* Right now we are at an impasse
   * He doesn't want to do any more work on the company, but at the same time doesnt want to leave, he has a full time job (since about 1 year ago)
   * I am still doing this marketing business full time, as I have been doing pretty much by myself for the last year
   * There alot of other things, that might just complicate this, so I will keep it simple for now
* Basically I do not want to keep building up the reputation and value of this company (more case studies, more revenue, maybe for eventual sale etc), while having my ex business part tagging alone for the ride
* We do not have a shareholder agreement or any sorts, when we started the partnership, things were easy and great, as it often is with partnerships, so we didnt think we need it

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

* I am now setting up a new marketing agency
* Can I still use the same branding as the previous company? It is not trademarked
* Would he be able to attack me or sue me for anything, like taking away my OWN clients, and using my own clients as case studies?
* Would he be able to attack me if we used shared clients we worked on together?
* For finance, I registered the company for this financial year, is there a way to backdate some of the older clients/transactions from the last few months and move it to the new company? When registering the ABN, I made it start from 1/1/2019, as well as GST registration, since thats when the disagreements started

My lease includes a crime and drug free addendum which explicitly prohibits illegal sale, manufacture or possession of controlled substances.

I bought some Hemp from a smoke shop (quite literally 5 minutes away) to help quit smoking marijuana (which I have not since I began occupancy) and I was reported by my neighbor the floor below me. 

I received a letter that states a conspicuous smell is coming from my apartment, then quotes the crime/drug free addendum and states my tenancy will be immediately terminated and the police will be notified if they receive further complaints. 

It's also to my understanding that Hemp, and it's associated THC concentrations, are completely descheduled as a controlled substance by the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (Farm Bill 2018) Sec. 12619, and is therefore legal to possess at a federal level (and clearly at a local level considering I again, bought and paid sales tax for this Hemp)

My questions are:
1.) Can my tenancy legally be terminated for this a ""conspicuous smell"" if it is proven to come from an entirely legal source?
2.) Can they actually call the cops for a conspicuous smell, and if so, what should I do to stay on the right side of the law in that case?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Louis, MO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are:
1.) Can my tenancy legally be terminated for this a &amp;quot;conspicuous smell&amp;quot; if it is proven to come from an entirely legal source?
2.) Can they actually call the cops for a conspicuous smell, and if so, what should I do to stay on the right side of the law in that case?&lt;/p&gt;

I live in a very small rural community (&lt;2,000 people) and my mother in law runs an unlicensed daycare out of a house that she rents. (She isn't required to be licensed because she only watches 2-3 children who aren't related to her on a regular basis.) One of the children, Billy (not his real name for privacy reasons) had some behavioral issues that his parents failed to mention when my MIL agreed to care for him. When she found out about these issues, she was concerned for the safety of the other kids so she contacted his parents and told them that unfortunately she wouldn't be able to have him at the daycare anymore. 

On Friday, Billy's father showed up to pay for the last few days he spent there and made the remark that he hopes one of her kids dies a horrible f'ing death. She was obviously shocked by this and asked who he was talking about because she actually did have a child who passed away from a rare illness when he was 18, but she wasn't sure if Billy's dad knew about it. He responded with, ""I don't care, the ones in there.""

After he left, she immediately called the police. After telling the chief of police the whole story, he told her that he could issue a ""no trespass order"" ( or something like that) which would make it a misdemeanor if he sets foot on the property again. But, he said since Billy's dad only said he *hoped* something would happen, it wasn't a direct threat and nothing else could be done.  

Is this true? Because it's a small town, I know of the guy and he is known to have a temper. (He's been banned from one other business in town for making threats of some sort.) I'm terrified to send my kids back there on Monday because I'm not sure he wouldn't do something to harm my MIL and/or the children under her care.

Eldest nephew and I are very close. He is the smartest person I know, but flunked our of high-school as he didn’t want to go to college. I begged him to go back and get his diploma in case he ever changed his mind, and he did! 

Recently he applied and was accepted to a continuing education program though the military. Not sure exactly how it works, but he will be sent to a particular college through the army while he completes his training. 

At some point he realized that he is missing a prerequisite high school course that he needs to be eligible for the degree. So the genius edited his high school transcript to include the missing credit. This is obviously a massive problem 

From a moral standpoint there is only one option: he needs to withdraw from the program before anything bad happens, go back and properly achieve the credit. He knows this, and only he can make that decision. He is an adult and I will not be stepping in.

From a legal standpoint, if he withdraws now can he still get in trouble? If he accepts the offer as is I’m pretty sure that’s fraud and is very serious. As he has not yet benefitted from his illegal actions, I’m hoping that backing out now would leave him safe from legal action. 

Nephew has been out of school 5+ years and would be considered a mature student. I know there is leeway for mature students who have not competed highschool. Nephew has a diploma, he is just missing a prerequisite credit. What are his chances of being accepted to the program without the credit as he has already passed the testing without it? (Before lying about his transcript passing the tests was done without fraud) 

If he wants to be a complete dumbass and continue, how likely is he to be caught? I’ve spoken to a few people who are a lot more knowledgeable than myself and I am getting mixed opinions. 

Genius Nephews theory is that, he has been accepted by the military and therefore has been accepted by the college. He thinks his transcript and any other files will be sent to the college via the military(so they will receive the same doctored transcript). One person told me fraudulent high school transcripts are probably more common than we think and that those students just fail but are not caught. This person thinks that nephew may have actually gotten away with this. 

Another person thinks that he has been only been accepted by the military and the college will have a separate application process entirely (there is at least an interview with the college) In this scenario the college could ask for the transcript directly from his high school, and not the military. What is the common procedure for college acceptance through the military? Do they just accept the candidates they are given or do they do a secondary application process? Any insight to this process is appreciated. 

We are having dinner in a few days and I want to be armed with all the facts. This will not be a moral discussion, this is wrong and he knows it. I will be discussing with him all the potential ways he could be caught and the possible legal ramifications. Can he go to jail for this? What is the worst possible scenario? Also provided he backs out now, what are his best options for being accepted this program properly. We are in Canada.

Review:


Bid Process: He contacted me right away asking for pics of my kitchen.  I sent them and he quoted me a price.  Pics of the tile (marble and mother of pearl) were already in the job request. He gave me the bid and I accepted.  I sent him pictures of the mortar and grout and asked if they were ok and if he needed anything else. He ok’d them and asked that I get sealer, which I did. He did ask for a bit more money, which I felt was fair and agreed to.  He charged a flat fee + a fee per outlet cut out.  He contacted me a few days later and told me he had had a cancellation and asked if he could come earlier to do the backsplash. I had originally planned to have countertops put in first, but he assured me that it would not be a problem to have the tile put in first.

 

Day 1:  Demo went fine.  He kept my floors safe with plastic and cleaned up the demo mess.  He and his partner put up the backer board and things seemed to be going smoothly.  He did move a light switch for me.  He ended up needing more wire, which I went out and got for him.

 

Day 2: Tile went up.  It went up a bit unevenly, but I wasn’t hovering over them, so I didn’t see it until most of it was up.  He made a comment that if it was his house, he would have used spacers.  Not sure why he didn’t use spacers for me, but I didn’t mind too much that it was uneven.  While they were working, the countertop guy came in to measure.  He pulled me aside to let me know that when the tile guys had pulled up the countertop, they hadn’t pushed it back down before they started tiling, so the tile was going in on an incline.  I let them know and they pulled all the tile off and retiled.

 

Day  3: Grout went in.  I asked how the edges of a couple of my walls was going to be finished, as the tile stops there.  He then told me I needed an edging piece. No problem.  I asked him to text me exactly what he needed, and I went off to Home Depot to get it.  I went in and they gave me the edging.  I went back and he told me that the edging piece I purchased was not going to work because it needed to installed under the tile.  Home Depot didn’t have the piece he wanted, so I went to Lowes.  They didn’t have it, so I went to an actual tile store.  The associate working there looked the piece up and let me know it was a commercial corner protector and should not be placed as edging, especially over marble tile.  She told me that the correct way to tile an edge would be to use the piece I bought.  She recommended that I tell him he needs to fix it.  When I got back home, I discussed it with him.  He tried to talk me into the corner protector, but eventually agreed to put in the correct edging.  When he was finished, I pointed out some areas that didn’t look right (grout, uneven outlet cut outs, etc) and he told me he would come back and “clean up”. I also pointed out that my under-cabinet lights no longer turned off when I flipped the switch.  He initially protested, but his partner agreed with me and he fixed the switch.  He was agitated at that point, commenting that he was six hours late to another job.  As a woman, home alone with 5 kids in the house, I didn’t really feel in a position to argue with him and just wanted him to leave the house, so I paid him, and he left.

 

Aftermath: He said he would come back, but the day he was due, he made excuses as to why he wouldn’t be coming over and that it would probably be better for him to come after the countertops were installed.  I let him know that I was unhappy with the finish and he placed the blame mostly on me.  That I didn’t buy the right materials ( I sent him pics to approve) , I made last minute changes (I was never asked about the edging and would have gotten him what he needed before work began), that if I wanted quality work I should have paid more (he set the price), etc.  He also told me that in his eyes, the job was finished. 

When the countertops were installed, they had to be shimmed up because the tile was not placed low enough. Even so, there is an uneven line between the tile and the countertop.  The countertop guys told me the backsplash should always go in before the countertops.  The tile layer on staff recommended that I see if there was an LLC and sue to have the tile replaced, as it is very poorly done. 

He has offered to come back out here to “fix” what he can, but my faith in his ability to fix anything is low.  So here we are, looking to hire someone else to come and salvage whatever they can.  If it can’t be fixed, we will have to tear it out and start over.  I’m sad it turned out this way.

When I expressed concerns, he became defense and irritated.  I’m not suing or trying to get money back, but I left the following review.  Now he’s threatening to sue if I don’t take it down.  I can link pictures if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bid Process: He contacted me right away asking for pics of my kitchen.  I sent them and he quoted me a price.  Pics of the tile (marble and mother of pearl) were already in the job request. He gave me the bid and I accepted.  I sent him pictures of the mortar and grout and asked if they were ok and if he needed anything else. He ok’d them and asked that I get sealer, which I did. He did ask for a bit more money, which I felt was fair and agreed to.  He charged a flat fee + a fee per outlet cut out.  He contacted me a few days later and told me he had had a cancellation and asked if he could come earlier to do the backsplash.

For the sake of this post, I'm calling my street ""Chair"", because my street's name is also a noun that can be singular or plural.

History: I purchased the house myself about 11 years ago.  I was told from the beginning that I lived at XXXX Chair ***Street***.  All of my mail goes to that address, and all my credit cards and driver's license list that as my address.  I receive deliveries there, and when people put that into their GPS, they end up at my house.  I have often had to make sure no one sent anything to XXXX Chair(s) Street, because my street name is singular, not plural.

However...when I went to look it up on my county's site, it could not find me.  It could, however, prefill the search bar with my name, and my street, but it was Chair AVENUE.  But then I got a 404 error and it will not pull up info for my property at either address.

So I went to my files and this year's most recent country appraisal mailing and, sure enough, it lists me living at XXXX Chair ***Avenue***.

I just never noticed this.  I'm probably foolish for it, I know.  But each year's appraisal has been in keeping with the rising property values around me and seemed appropriate for the upgrades I've made on the property.

I just took a drive along my street, from its beginning (a shoot-off from a major street of residential houses/mansions), to its seamless transformation into another street name.  My street is 5 blocks long.  4 of them are labeled with street signs that say ""Chair Street"".  The last one is labeled ""Chair***s*** Street"". But on paper, according to my county, I live on Chair***s***

My friend got laid off in May 2018.  She signed a separation agreement that had a non-compete/non- solicitation period of 6 months following the separation date.   In 2016 she took a new role at the company she got fired from and signed a non-compete that she thinks had a period of 18 months.  She can’t find this paperwork anywhere. 
She was recently offered a job by a direct competitor of her old company. 

Questions:
-Which time period is enforceable here- 6 months or 18 months??
-How truly enforceable is either period given that she was let go, and that the non-compete section of here separation agreement is very vague?

The place had a ton of issues but, up until now, it’s all been things I could repair myself.

Three weeks ago today, I bought a set. Turns out, the cold water for the washer doesn’t work and the electrical outlet for the dryer is not receiving power. 

The following Monday, I called my landlord’s office and left a voicemail. Left another one Thursday since I hadn’t heard back. Finally, Tuesday he calls back and says he’ll send someone out Saturday. No one shows up.

I let him know and he texts me back “Got it.” Tuesday rolls around again and he still hasn’t gotten back to me so I ask him if someone can come out today before 1pm when I leave for work. He says no problem. 

At 11:30 today, I text him and ask if someone is still coming since I’ll be leaving in a hour and a half. No response. I’m leaving in 20 minutes and still no one. 

Now at this point I’m so sick of messing around with this guy that I’m willing to do the repairs myself but the basement has two locks on it so I couldn’t even if I wanted to. 

What are my rights in the situation? Do I have enough reason to withhold rent at the end of the month?

The tree crushed three panels of the fence that separates our yards. Neighbor told us to fix the fence and send them the bill for reimbursement. We never told them we would, and informed them that our insurance company told us the fence was on their side of the property line, and that they weren't going to pay us out for repairs. We decided not to do the repairs. 

Fast forward to today, and the fence is still down. The tree limbs from the storm are still tangled in the fence. They have since informed us several times they'll get to it, but they always have excuses about why it hasn't been fixed yet. We got an independent contractor to assess the damage and priced the repairs at $1250. We've drafted a demand letter, requesting they either repair the fence themselves or hire somebody to do it for them by the end of August. We've threatened to take them to small claims court for the cost of the contractor's assessment if it's not fixed by then. If brought to court, we will make the case that we have a toddler and having sharp pieces of wood is creating an unsafe environment for them. Beyond that, we've found dog poop in our yard numerous times. We don't own a dog. They do. 

Extra info not necessarily related to the case, but might be: in July of 2018 a second storm came and wiped out the rest of the tree, which hung entirely over our property line. It devastated our yard, causing another $4500+ of property damage, which doesn't include our garden which also had roughly $1000 of damage to it. In the assessment, an independent contractor determined that the tree had actually been dead for quite some time, and had rotted on the inside. Between the March and July incidents, we requested that our neighbors take down the tree, which they refused to do. Unfortunately it looks like our insurance company dropped this part of the investigation to try to get them to pay us back our deductible. 

We won't be looking to take action on the July incident, but I wanted to give some extra context to the situation. To summarize: do we have the advantage here in small claims court or are we just doomed to have these shitty neighbors fix the fence whenever they get around to it?

I've got Supervisors above me, and Managers above them. I lead a sales area which has 4 registers.

We have our own specific Lead Gmail account. the majority of leads and supervisors all have these accounts added to their phones and regularly communicate through them.

I come from a management background and I've always felt as if my current company is a liabilities nightmare. they upload personal social security/identification cards of employees onto a google drive account which over 20+ people have access to. Current leads, past leads, supervisors, managers, and HR. they haven't changed the password in the past 5 months. I've brought these security issues up with management several times only to be told they would be removing them.(They are still present today)

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago I was made aware of a significant register shortage in the site I lead by my supervisors. After being made aware of these issues I decided to look into it. Our registers are ran with [Vendhq.com](https://Vendhq.com) it's a third party POS system. generally we upload daily reports from Vendhq.com onto our Gmail accounts and send them out in our daily reports. I decided to check vend directly because there was never a mention of register shortages in the google account.

&amp;#x200B;

I logged into my personal account on [vendhq.com](https://vendhq.com) while at work. I looked at the register closure reports from the area I manage.(Which I have permissions granted to me on my user account) and I uploaded the file onto a Google Spreadsheet and shared it with myself so I could look at it longer at home. I was fascinated we had the amount of shortages we had and nobody had made me aware sooner.

&amp;#x200B;

That same day I spoke with the site assistant manager about the amount of money missing from those registers on a near daily basis, and asked why it was never brought up in our daily reports where the supervisor on shift is suppose to count the money, and send out register reports. She said she was completely unaware of the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I had several Supervisors contact me about the register shortages, and asked me if I felt it was various employees. I decided to look into our schedules while at work. and noticed one specific employee who was working nearly everyday money was missing. I brought that up to the attention of my area supervisor, and the assistant manager.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Today I get called into our managers office for an interview with HR. i'm asked a million questions. I let them know exactly what happened. and apparently she said employees have said I accused a coworker of stealing funds. I let her know I only brought that information to my supervisor and site assistant manager. I told her I never accused anyone, I simply said I suspected an employee as stealing. She said it was a liability to talk to my supervisor about it. it should have been brought straight to HR or our site Manager and assistant manager only. I apologized and called it a lapse in judgement.

I am very transparent and honest I let her know essentially everything, and because I shared the register closure google sheet with my personal email, she accused me of Theft. saying it was company information. I argued that although it was on my personal email it was something I had every right to access as Complete register closure reports should be posted on our shared gmail that everyone has access to. but for whatever reason whoever was posting the reports was leaving out the fact our registers were short which they should not have.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I understand the liabilities of throwing out accusations and although I never should have shared that information with my supervisor.(still questioning if that is even wrong.), I don't want to be fired for theft. Also I'm pretty irritated I'm suspended pending further investigation but I don't feel as if it is fair. I understand company information is their property, but I was granted permissions to view it, and should have had access to it. the only reason I saved it on my personal drive was so I could find it easier when looking at it from home.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is.... Should I resign? Would resigning during an investigation hurt me in the future if I try to apply other jobs? Also can i really be fired for theft?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm going to be fired for Theft for saving information I should have access to on a personal account. and telling a supervisor and my site assistant manager I suspect a specific employee. All the while I had 2 different supervisors throw out 2 other names they had suspected. I don't really feel it would be fair to dismiss me over it. I brought my suspicions up with people in higher positions with myself while supervisors threw out suspects to an employee in a lower position.(myself).

&amp;#x200B;

I feel HR was just upset I looked into something that should be handled by someone else. Also she mentioned she was going to question everyone at my area to see if I disclosed any management type of information or accusations with anyone else. It's a scary thought because I have over 40 different employees working in my area so I'm sure a few will accuse me of all kinds of craziness.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a Sales lead at a job. I&amp;#39;ve got Supervisors above me, and Managers above them. I lead a sales area which has 4 registers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have our own specific Lead Gmail account. the majority of leads and supervisors all have these accounts added to their phones and regularly communicate through them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come from a management background and I&amp;#39;ve always felt as if my current company is a liabilities nightmare. they upload personal social security/identification cards of employees onto a google drive account which over 20+ people have access to. Current leads, past leads, supervisors, managers, and HR. they haven&amp;#39;t changed the password in the past 5 months. I&amp;#39;ve brought these security issues up with management several times only to be told they would be removing them.(They are still present today)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I was made aware of a significant register shortage in the site I lead by my supervisors. After being made aware of these issues I decided to look into it. Our registers are ran with &lt;a href=""https://Vendhq.com""&gt;Vendhq.com&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;#39;s a third party POS system. generally we upload daily reports from Vendhq.com onto our Gmail accounts and send them out in our daily reports. I decided to check vend directly because there was never a mention of register shortages in the google account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I logged into my personal account on &lt;a href=""https://vendhq.com""&gt;vendhq.com&lt;/a&gt; while at work. I looked at the register closure reports from the area I manage.(Which I have permissions granted to me on my user account) and I uploaded the file onto a Google Spreadsheet and shared it with myself so I could look at it longer at home. I was fascinated we had the amount of shortages we had and nobody had made me aware sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same day I spoke with the site assistant manager about the amount of money missing from those registers on a near daily basis, and asked why it was never brought up in our daily reports where the supervisor on shift is suppose to count the money, and send out register reports. She said she was completely unaware of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had several Supervisors contact me about the register shortages, and asked me if I felt it was various employees. I decided to look into our schedules while at work. and noticed one specific employee who was working nearly everyday money was missing. I brought that up to the attention of my area supervisor, and the assistant manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I get called into our managers office for an interview with HR. i&amp;#39;m asked a million questions. I let them know exactly what happened. and apparently she said employees have said I accused a coworker of stealing funds. I let her know I only brought that information to my supervisor and site assistant manager. I told her I never accused anyone, I simply said I suspected an employee as stealing. She said it was a liability to talk to my supervisor about it. it should have been brought straight to HR or our site Manager and assistant manager only. I apologized and called it a lapse in judgement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very transparent and honest I let her know essentially everything, and because I shared the register closure google sheet with my personal email, she accused me of Theft. saying it was company information. I argued that although it was on my personal email it was something I had every right to access as Complete register closure reports should be posted on our shared gmail that everyone has access to. but for whatever reason whoever was posting the reports was leaving out the fact our registers were short which they should not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways I understand the liabilities of throwing out accusations and although I never should have shared that information with my supervisor.(still questioning if that is even wrong.), I don&amp;#39;t want to be fired for theft. Also I&amp;#39;m pretty irritated I&amp;#39;m suspended pending further investigation but I don&amp;#39;t feel as if it is fair. I understand company information is their property, but I was granted permissions to view it, and should have had access to it. the only reason I saved it on my personal drive was so I could find it easier when looking at it from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is.... Should I resign? Would resigning during an investigation hurt me in the future if I try to apply other jobs? Also can i really be fired for theft?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m going to be fired for Theft for saving information I should have access to on a personal account. and telling a supervisor and my site assistant manager I suspect a specific employee. All the while I had 2 different supervisors throw out 2 other names they had suspected. I don&amp;#39;t really feel it would be fair to dismiss me over it. I brought my suspicions up with people in higher positions with myself while supervisors threw out suspects to an employee in a lower position.(myself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel HR was just upset I looked into something that should be handled by someone else. Also she mentioned she was going to question everyone at my area to see if I disclosed any management type of information or accusations with anyone else. It&amp;#39;s a scary thought because I have over 40 different employees working in my area so I&amp;#39;m sure a few will accuse me of all kinds of craziness.&lt;/p&gt;

I live in the Greater Seattle area, but NOT inside King County. I’m devastated now because I received a default divorce judgment. I did not sleep well for a week (Avg. 3-4hrs per night) and my head is very cloudy, so sorry if I am not using the correct legal terms or if my story is convoluted. However, I want to be clear – I take full responsibilities of my faults of not hiring a divorce lawyer and not reading the court paper carefully. You don’t need to criticize me, I think I will continue to kick myself in the years to come.

My goal here is to tell my story and hopefully, I can get some opinions and suggestions. All your constructive feedback are welcome and I will formulate my own decision. Thank you all in advance!

Here it goes – my ex-wife filed for a divorce in November 2018, and the Divorce Settlement Agreement was heavily favorable to her. Per her explanation, she wanted to “kick-start the divorce procedure and we could discuss all the detailed line items as we move forward”. Therefore, we had a verbal agreement that I needed to move out first and continue the discussion of our divorce divisions, with the objective of finalizing the divorce in July or August 2019.

I moved out in December 2018 and took a few of my personal belongings and necessities in the following months. In May 2019, I was served with a new court paper. I was perplexed by it and called her, her explanation was she (and her lawyer) need to move the case along, so she lowered the child support payment amount. Again, “we were still going to negotiate our property divisions”, she said.

Then, in late June 2019, she told me that we’re divorced. It was completely shocking to me! Apparently, there was a court date that was buried in the 2nd stack of court paper. Because I called her and asked what it was about, I didn’t read the paper myself. I trusted her and I thought we were still in negotiation, it’s the biggest mistake that I’ve ever made!!! Her reply was, “I’m not your secretary. The court made the decision, there’s nothing she could do.” 

In last week, I finally contacted a lawyer and had a consultation. She suggested filing a motion to vacate the civil judgment (Civil Rule 60 - WA State), and then to renegotiate the divorce settlement. BTW, her rate is $350 and the retainer is $10,000.

To be clear, I don’t want to stay married to her. I only want to fairly divide our assets and to create a thoughtful parenting plan.

Points of contention:

1) the house deed has my and my EX’s names on it. But, per her demand (and now judgment), she gets to live there as long as she wants or when my child turns to 18.

2) She drew up the parenting plan, we didn’t have a proper discussion, I wish to have a detailed plan.

3) She filed the divorce paper first so everything was in her favor, she’s got to keep everything, I didn’t even get as minute as plates or forks.

To be honest, I only care about my child and I can let go all those materialistic things – I just want to be the best dad to my child and I want to move on. However, I really would like to hear from other people’s perspectives.

Should I file a motion to vacate the civil judgment? (I think the success rate is slim.) Or, what are my next strategic steps?

What are your suggestions? I'm totally lost.

My parents direct the youth orchestra in our area and there have been considerable problems with their treasurer and parent board.

In a written contract, the responsibilities of my parents as instructors were laid out as well as the pay and the dates on which they were supposed to be paid. At the start of the program year last fall, pay was consistently late by a few weeks and on several occasions over a month. The treasurer would come up with an excuse every month and every month they had to refer back to the contract and insist that they were entitled to pay on a specific date. Things did not get better over the the rest of the school year.

Recently, they were asked to do a week long summer camp for two age groups. It was an all day camp and they were initially expected to do so with no help or staff.

As a favor to my parents, my sister and I, also being musicians, helped with the camp and were told we would be paid $500 dollars. My parents we supposed to be paid over 1000 per person. May have been higher. The camp went great. All resources used were already owned and the facility cost was nothing as it was donated space. When I first arrived I was informed that I would only be making $100 and of course I was frustrated but it was more of a favor anyway so I wasn't overly bothered.

Our mistake of course was not having a written contract. Everything regarding the camp was entirely verbal but I believe there are specifics detailed in text messages and emails. Nothing formal. At the end of the week, we were given checks. My sister and I both got our checks for $100 dollars but my parents checks were for ~300 and ~700 (don't remember the exact values off the top of my head)

I myself teaching cello make $50 an hour and my parents make $80+ as they have master's degrees. From a purely non legal, common sense perspective this pay is ridiculous, and it goes against what was initially agreed upon.

Their justification is that at the start of the fall last year they overpaid my parents under the separate, written contract for the youth orchestra and decided to subtract that amount from the pay for the camps. They only told us this after the camp was over when they gave us the checks. We would never have worked the camps had they informed us at the start of the week.

There was no good way for us to know they had over paid us. It was a common occurence that we would be twice in one month because the payment from the previous month was so late that it would be after the next payment. As musicians, we make money from quite a few places and just assumed it was a makeup payment from the precious month. There was nothing in the written contract about what to do in that kind of situation and they themselves didn't find out about it until just before the camp.

We're currently in the process of selling our house and moving out of state and we don't know if we have the time or money for a lawsuit. What are our options here?

TL;DR a written and verbal contract, incompetence of a treasurer, and a lack of communication led to a withholding of wages

&lt;p&gt;In a written contract, the responsibilities of my parents as instructors were laid out as well as the pay and the dates on which they were supposed to be paid. At the start of the program year last fall, pay was consistently late by a few weeks and on several occasions over a month. The treasurer would come up with an excuse every month and every month they had to refer back to the contract and insist that they were entitled to pay on a specific date. Things did not get better over the the rest of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, they were asked to do a week long summer camp for two age groups. It was an all day camp and they were initially expected to do so with no help or staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a favor to my parents, my sister and I, also being musicians, helped with the camp and were told we would be paid $500 dollars. My parents we supposed to be paid over 1000 per person. May have been higher. The camp went great. All resources used were already owned and the facility cost was nothing as it was donated space. When I first arrived I was informed that I would only be making $100 and of course I was frustrated but it was more of a favor anyway so I wasn&amp;#39;t overly bothered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mistake of course was not having a written contract. Everything regarding the camp was entirely verbal but I believe there are specifics detailed in text messages and emails. Nothing formal. At the end of the week, we were given checks. My sister and I both got our checks for $100 dollars but my parents checks were for ~300 and ~700 (don&amp;#39;t remember the exact values off the top of my head)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I myself teaching cello make $50 an hour and my parents make $80+ as they have master&amp;#39;s degrees. From a purely non legal, common sense perspective this pay is ridiculous, and it goes against what was initially agreed upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their justification is that at the start of the fall last year they overpaid my parents under the separate, written contract for the youth orchestra and decided to subtract that amount from the pay for the camps. They only told us this after the camp was over when they gave us the checks. We would never have worked the camps had they informed us at the start of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no good way for us to know they had over paid us. It was a common occurence that we would be twice in one month because the payment from the previous month was so late that it would be after the next payment. As musicians, we make money from quite a few places and just assumed it was a makeup payment from the precious month. There was nothing in the written contract about what to do in that kind of situation and they themselves didn&amp;#39;t find out about it until just before the camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re currently in the process of selling our house and moving out of state and we don&amp;#39;t know if we have the time or money for a lawsuit. What are our options here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR a written and verbal contract, incompetence of a treasurer, and a lack of communication led to a withholding of wages&lt;/p&gt;

Throwaway account for obvious reasons.  I apologize if this topic has been discussed before, but I've made a mistake and I've been freaking out ever since.

A few days ago, I fell off the wagon and started drinking.  The reason i stopped in the first place is because I do things that I greatly regret the next morning and can barely face myself.  Well, a few days ago after drinking, I made the mistake of soliciting a prostitute.  I called/texted a few before one answered (it was very late at night/early morning).  I ended up going to a hotel and paying someone for sex.

I can't stop thinking that the cops are going to be knocking at my door any second to arrest me for both solicitation and prostitution.  I paid in cash and met the prostitute in the hotel room itself, so the only thing that she would have is my cell phone number.  Will police spend time looking for me if she is caught/arrested? Am I in any jeopardy since I wasn't caught in the act itself (it wasn't a sting)?   I'm also worried because i contacted a few others (obviously the charges there would be only solicitation rather than both solicitation and prostitution because the other ones I contacted never went anywhere).

This was my first time doing anything like this, so I know i won't ever due it again (especially with how crazy I've been going).  Thank you, and any advice is welcome.

Because I would not have a lot of time between jobs, we arranged to move such that I would relocate first to settle on a new place and she would follow a few weeks later.

&amp;#x200B;

To avoid breaking the lease contract, we followed the instructions of someone at the apartment office to pay rent and utilities all the way through the end of the lease (May 26th), even though we were both out by mid-April. So as far as I can tell, there aren't any problems with lease violations.

&amp;#x200B;

Before moving out, my wife gave them the address of our new apartment as the mail forwarding address so that we could receive any deposit check or itemized statement from them. The total amount of deposits paid were $500.

&amp;#x200B;

Mid-May a few days before the lease was set to officially end I contacted the apartment via email to ask when I could expect the deposit check or statement in the mail, and was told it would be 10 calendar days after the lease end. After waiting well over that period of time and not having received anything, I contacted them again and they asked me to confirm my forwarding address. I gave them the address, but received no further response in the email chain.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I decided I would call the apartment to try to find out why I hadn't heard anything. The person I talked to told me the forwarding address they had on file was in Buda, TX. I don't know anyone who lives there, and having a completely wrong forwarding address turned out to only be the start of my concerns. I asked her to send me a copy of the statement to my email.

&amp;#x200B;

I see some items on the move out that don't look right. The first is a cleaning fee for ""heavy clean 2 bedroom"", which is odd because this was strictly a 1-bedroom apartment (no study or spare rooms). But far more concerning is a $500 Trash Removal fee. While I was told during the move-out process that there would be a fee for any garbage removed, I recall that amount being around $25 per bag. There were some items that were unfortunately left behind, but looking at the pictures it wasn't that much. In addition, I remember asking my dad who was still in town to swing by the apartment and he remarked only 1 large trash bag was left outside after they were supposedly done. $500 seems way overboard for removing a relatively small amount of trash, and added to the cleaning fees and move-out balance puts it over my $500 balance, so they say I *owe* them over $400.

&amp;#x200B;

What recourse do I have for contesting owing them so much money for trash removal (and possibly a 2-bedroom cleaning fee)? If I am unable to contest it, does them initially sending the statement to a completely wrong address affect how long I would have to pay?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year my wife and I moved out of an apartment in Austin, TX over to Washington State.

&lt;p&gt;To avoid breaking the lease contract, we followed the instructions of someone at the apartment office to pay rent and utilities all the way through the end of the lease (May 26th), even though we were both out by mid-April. So as far as I can tell, there aren&amp;#39;t any problems with lease violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before moving out, my wife gave them the address of our new apartment as the mail forwarding address so that we could receive any deposit check or itemized statement from them. The total amount of deposits paid were $500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-May a few days before the lease was set to officially end I contacted the apartment via email to ask when I could expect the deposit check or statement in the mail, and was told it would be 10 calendar days after the lease end. After waiting well over that period of time and not having received anything, I contacted them again and they asked me to confirm my forwarding address. I gave them the address, but received no further response in the email chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I decided I would call the apartment to try to find out why I hadn&amp;#39;t heard anything. The person I talked to told me the forwarding address they had on file was in Buda, TX. I don&amp;#39;t know anyone who lives there, and having a completely wrong forwarding address turned out to only be the start of my concerns. I asked her to send me a copy of the statement to my email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see some items on the move out that don&amp;#39;t look right. The first is a cleaning fee for &amp;quot;heavy clean 2 bedroom&amp;quot;, which is odd because this was strictly a 1-bedroom apartment (no study or spare rooms). But far more concerning is a $500 Trash Removal fee. While I was told during the move-out process that there would be a fee for any garbage removed, I recall that amount being around $25 per bag. There were some items that were unfortunately left behind, but looking at the pictures it wasn&amp;#39;t that much. In addition, I remember asking my dad who was still in town to swing by the apartment and he remarked only 1 large trash bag was left outside after they were supposedly done. $500 seems way overboard for removing a relatively small amount of trash, and added to the cleaning fees and move-out balance puts it over my $500 balance, so they say I &lt;em&gt;owe&lt;/em&gt; them over $400.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What recourse do I have for contesting owing them so much money for trash removal (and possibly a 2-bedroom cleaning fee)? If I am unable to contest it, does them initially sending the statement to a completely wrong address affect how long I would have to pay?&lt;/p&gt;

Nobody has done it since the competition started.

However, for every 5 game streak there is a mini prize. The prizes for 5 through 35 game hit streaks are fairly inconsequential, ranging from a day/week/month of MLB.tv (their streaming service) to an entry to win tickets to the world series. 

At a streak of 40, the prizes became more substantial. Tickets to a game, or cash prizes from $500-$1500.

Here's where it gets interesting. Around the middle of June a couple players crossed the 40 game mark and we're heading into great prize territory.  I have a screenshot from June 27th from when my father sent me a text to settle an argument over one of the prizes.

On July 6th, a contestant was poised to get a 50 streak. I open the app to check the prizes and I'm greeted by severely reduced prizes.

Below is the portion of the TOS that references these prizes and how MLB reserves the right to adjust them. This seems like a breach of their own TOS to adjust prizes in this way. 

Am I missing something other than this being a scummy move by MLB? Because this seems illegal in some way.

They appear to be doing everything in their power to force me into forbearance,  which they recommend to me every time we talk. I came out of default a few months ago, and they refused to tell me repayment options. They said that my payments would be 400. Then they said they miscalculated. Then they said they were physically incapable of calculating, because something about me coming out of default. Most recently, I found out I qualify for income based repayment. So I called and asked them about it. They said my payment would be like 200$ a month(which I can kind of maybe afford). They also told me my upcoming payment(in August) is 600-700$. They said there was no timeframe I needed to apply in, just to do it before August. Well that was a lie. But of course I applied like that day, so no big deal. Then it got denied. For some reason 3 of my student loans are supposedly paid through 2023 or something... Weird though since they told me I owe like 600 dollars in 30 days... So I called to forfeit my ""paid ahead"" status. They were like cool done, and tried getting me off the phone. I asked several questions and found out not only did I have to resubmit my application for IBR, but I also had to do it like that day... They got off the phone. I'm waiting to see what happens now that I've reapplied, but in the meantime I'm realizing my balance went up. Which is super confusing, because I checked the interest for each loan, and I paid like that plus 50$. Yet my overall balance went up nearly 100$? How??

My questions: Can I switch loan servicers?If I consolidate my loans, can I still get IBR?What recourse do I have against shady student loan practices?Why, if there actually is any kind of reason, would my principal still go up if I paid more than my interest??

They appear to be doing everything in their power to force me into forbearance,  which they recommend to me every time we talk. I came out of default a few months ago, and they refused to tell me repayment options. They said that my payments would be 400. Then they said they miscalculated. Then they said they were physically incapable of calculating, because something about me coming out of default. Most recently, I found out I qualify for income based repayment. So I called and asked them about it. They said my payment would be like 200$ a month(which I can kind of maybe afford). They also told me my upcoming payment(in August) is 600-700$. They said there was no timeframe I needed to apply in, just to do it before August. Well that was a lie. But of course I applied like that day, so no big deal. Then it got denied. For some reason 3 of my student loans are supposedly paid through 2023 or something... Weird though since they told me I owe like 600 dollars in 30 days... So I called to forfeit my &amp;quot;paid ahead&amp;quot; status. They were like cool done, and tried getting me off the phone. I asked several questions and found out not only did I have to resubmit my application for IBR, but I also had to do it like that day... They got off the phone. I&amp;#39;m waiting to see what happens now that I&amp;#39;ve reapplied, but in the meantime I&amp;#39;m realizing my balance went up. Which is super confusing, because I checked the interest for each loan, and I paid like that plus 50$. Yet my overall balance went up nearly 100$? How??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions: Can I switch loan servicers?If I consolidate my loans, can I still get IBR?What recourse do I have against shady student loan practices?Why, if there actually is any kind of reason, would my principal still go up if I paid more than my interest??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!  &lt;/p&gt;

She was recently diagnosed and treated properly for a serious dietary issue, but the ensuing insurance battle has been anything but simple.

Where we are in the process:

Two months after the treatment, we received notice from the insurance company (finally) explaining that they’d covered almost the entire bill, and that there would be ~$200 left for us to pay. (Of course, prior to the treatment, we were told it would be covered completely under her work health plan, but I digress).

Yesterday, though, we received a letter in the mail from the diagnostics company who provided the treatment stating that they’d already tried billing her HSA card without asking her, it had bounced, and that they demand payment of at least $200 dollars within 24 hours on what was now a $400 bill.

Our questions:

1. Is that legal to demand payment within 24 hours?/should we pay? (We can’t really, we’d have to borrow money somehow)

2. Where are they getting this new $399 price from? And why does the insurance company have a different number (the ~$200 one) than the diagnostics company?

3. Should we wait for word from the insurance company? Both the office of the diagnostics company and the insurance company are closed until tomorrow.

The fact that this wasn&amp;#39;t screened for this prior seems to be a bit negligent on part of the program, but I confess I don&amp;#39;t know much about the process. Is there anything he can do to at least be eligible to remain in the United States and continue his studies?&lt;/p&gt;

Originally, my uncle owned a large plot of land neighboring my family's property, sold the land to a family ""friend"" (very much in quotes) who built a house there, and held the mortgage on the land with a contract at 5% interest. 

When my uncle passed away in 2007, my father--to a fault a generous, understanding, and rather financially naive man, as you will see--inherited the mortgage note. This is where the problems start.

The friend continued paying on the principal until 2009, then gave my dad a story about financial troubles, and continued paying only the interest until 2013...when he stopped paying entirely. All the while promising he'd pay when he could, of course. (For what it's worth, the friend has been employed and living lavishly all this time, huge house, multiple nice cars, hired landscapers every week...he is definitely taking brazen advantage, not a struggling but genuine guy fallen on hard times. Meanwhile my dad is working himself to death in manual labor and living modestly. Yes, this situation really grinds my gears.)

I only found out about the whole thing yesterday and looked up the New Jersey statute of limitations on debt, which appears to be 6 years. Since the friend continued paying interest biannually (February and August, last payment Feb 2013), the first lapsed payment should be six years ago this August as I understand it. 

What I can't seem to find out is...what could happen at that point? Could the entire six-figure debt potentially just be wiped away? My father does still hold the deed to the land since the mortgage wasn't paid off yet--he couldn't lose that, right?

During this next month, what should we be doing? Could we have the contract redrawn or something? I'm encouraging my father to hire a real estate lawyer. He still believes the family friend has good intentions and ""he'll get paid eventually"" and doesn't want to cause a confrontation or burn any bridges. I'm concerned the friend never intends to pay and is just waiting for the statute of limitations to lapse so my father's legal options will be limited.

I have a job in Michigan and I need to know some laws to protect workers. If there are any laws, it would greatly help me to have the code or number or whatever laws are sorted by.

First thing to know is that I am scheduled 8 hours a day whenever I work. I am 21 years old, so I am not a minor. 

1: I work in a fast food job where things can get stressful. When things get stressful, it takes another hour or 2 to close down the store. On those days, I don't get a break and have to work 8-10 hours a day without a break. This has happened multiple times, and I have records of my punch cards.

2:While cleaning the store, I sometimes clean up the grill area. One of my responsibilities is to clean these air vent- grease catcher thingies. However, the grease that sits in the trough hasn't been cleaned in at least 2 months. It is to the point of overflowing.

3: One of the managers is young, clicks with his friends and will be a jerk to everyone else. He has on numerous occasions criticized my work (I have done my job the same or better than my co-workers). One day, he is talking to a customer (a friend of his), and he openly talked bad about me to the customer while I was standing right next to the both of them.

Im not sure if this is the correct place to post but I am kind of at a loss rn and Reddit always comes through for people so I figured I would give it a shot.
Ok so my mom is one of 10 kids.
Her parents own a retirement home in MA which is going to be passed down to the 10 kids once my grandma passes(grandfather has already passed)
Anyways my uncle was running it for about 20 years and it started doing poorly so my other uncle stepped in and discovered alot of waste and even embezzlement.
Long story short this uncle “D” (lives in CA but manages them 3k miles away) has stepped in for the pst 5 years and is claiming that it is doing really well. But after looking at the tax returns we are barely breaking even but he is paying himself 60k a year on top of whatever else. So in order to make the business more transparent and see where any of the siblings can help out we wanted to see the books.
At first he said yes but reluctantly. Now he learns that I am an accountant and suddenly reverses his decision.
So where I am suspicious of him is where he reversed his decision. But before that I thought it was awfully weird that he suddenly bought over 3million dollars of real estate just in the past 5 years since taking over.

A few hours later he sends me a couple dick pics. I tell him off and move on because i don't care much.

Although all siblings fight, most of the time it was him hurting me. I repressed the memory of the molestation until 2 years ago when it came back. For all this, I have gone no contact for almost 2 years. Unfortunately, I still sometimes find myself in situations where he is there, namely family gatherings and at family members houses. In these situations, I start to panic and try to leave as soon as I can. I feel like I’m a child again, alone and vulnerable. He always tries to come up to me and interact, and so I always tell him to leave me alone and to get away. 

Yesterday I was at my grandmother’s house, cooking lunch for myself. She was not there. My brother apparently shows up when I am cooking. My brother walks into the kitchen and comes up to me and starts to belittle me. I tell him to get away from me, but he doesn’t. I start to get nervous and scared, and so I raise my voice. He starts to say that I don’t love my grandmother and didn’t visit my great aunt in the hospital, and how I never talk to them. I start to say that I’m feeling threatened and to get away from me. He doesn’t, and I start to panic. I grab the kitchen knife I’m using for lunch, and repeat get away, I’m feeling threatened. I tell him that the last thing I want to do is hurt anyone, but if he starts to get physical I will defend myself.  I am now yelling to get away from me. He doesn’t, and asks what has he ever done to make him feel threatened. I break down, and tell him for the first time to his face that he molested me. He then tells me that if I ever say that again that he’d beat the crap out of me. Apparently his girlfriend is there and she tells him to leave with her (I think, she said something along those lines) and so he leaves. I end up having a panic attack in the bedroom I was staying in. 

Hours later, the police arrived. Apparently my brother filed a report against me for assault. I was immediately arrested, had no conversation about what happened, and then made bail. My dad picked me up, and I’m home now. 

My question is: how do I go about fighting these charges? I never wanted to hurt him and was only acting in self defence, as he’s hurt me in the past. I am certainly getting an attorney and will talk with them, but if anyone here can steer me in taking the right actions it would be much appreciated.

I was in an accident last month and I believe it wasn't only my fault. I was waiting to join a road, from a side-road, seeing that nobody's coming from the left, I waited for traffic on the right to pass through. Seeing that the oncoming driver of a black car has given a left signal, I proceeded to enter the road, but the person behind him ended up hitting the very end of my car, because I believe he didn't wait for the black car to completely turn, but moved to the middle of the road to pass faster. 

We agreed to settle this between ourselves, but when trying to contact him, either I wouldn't be able to pick up, or him. 

On the last day he tried contacting me, he called and about an hour later I called back, but he didn't pick up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I have received a third party insurance claim on his behalf, claiming that I have been a part of the accident, being informed that I have to respond.

So my mother decided to leave the “apartment finding” to me since she’s not really good with technology. I’ve been looking for an apartment for the past 6 months (before I graduated). 

2 weeks ago, I decided to go to my friends house and just chill. We’re both moving out of our parents houses so we started looking for apartments online. I came across a TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE apartment ad. Why I thought this was not a scam at the time really frustrates me. It was just too perfect!! A 1 bedroom, fully furnished apartment with pets allowed for just 500 a month! SCAM ALERT!! But the bells in my head were not ringing so I went for it. I contacted the owner and got a response the next day. 

The owner told me that I had to prove to him that I had the money since he had encountered many people that were interested in the apartment but they didn’t have the money. He wanted me to buy 500 worth of a prepaid card called Neosurf. Apparently once I visited the house, I could give him these prepaid cards in person. This was his way of assuring me that he would take the money. Upon buying the cards, I sent him a picture but hid the the pins, this was not enough for him. 

He sent me a link a told me to put in the cards information, it was sort of verification link so I didn’t think that my money would be stolen. I WAS PAINFULLY WRONG. That is exactly how he stole my money. 

Once I did the whole operation, I asked for a PDF of the apartments contrat but he made another excuse for me to pay an extra 500. I paid the money, using the same method. But I had a really sketchy feeling and I couldn’t stop thinking that this man stole my money. 

I then asked him for the contract again and he said he’d send to me the next morning. The morning came and I asked again. And guess what, he gave another reason for me to pay. This time I refused because it was pretty clear to me what was happening. I WAS BEING SCAMED. Once I refused he told me that he’d find another person for the apartment. 

I checked my balance on each Neosurf card and they all indicated that there was no money in the cards. 

I have contacted the police and everything but they told me that the chances of him being found are very slim. Is there any way I can get my money back?

I was desperate and just wanted to eat, but am now in a much better position in life and have excelled in my position while considerably improving the company itself. The pay is still well below the market rate for my position, but the environment is friendly, I have a lot of lee-way and enjoy my job. I have been told there is no budget to bring my position within normal market rates but have received nominal small raises as recognition for my work and have had consistently positive reviews and have reached or exceeded all milestones.

About 4 months ago, my company's largest competitor in a different country (but with overlap into our region) has posted a job opening for my exact position and credentials, but with 5x the pay (slightly over market value). If I applied, I would likely have a very good chance of getting the position. The problem is my current company had me sign a fairly standard non-compete, non-disclosure agreement which mentions not working for competitors 'for the duration of this contract'. I'm having a hard time understanding the legalese in the contract so am wondering how binding non-competes are and whether it's worth the risk? Is there an online (reputable) service where I can ask someone to look at my contract for this limitation for a small fee?

If I apply, the company would obviously know I'd worked for one of their competitors, would this be an automatic rejection? The job requires prior knowledge of our exact industry and it's a pretty small pool, so I'm curious how else I would achieve this experience without having worked for a competitor. Should I tell them I may have a non-compete/non-disclosure?

tl;dr: currently working extremely poorly compensated but a much better paying position is open with a competitor, how much of an issue is my non-compete/non-disclosure and should I even bother?

I own a 1990 mazda miata that is track legal, its loud. Its lowered and it screams even at low speeds. I do track it and i always go to a track for spirited driving however, i had just washed the car and i wanted to go for a cruise through a very scenic park. So i did with a friend in the passenger seat.

I should honestly say more about how the car looks and sounds. Its a straight piped track car. It has a roll cage, bucket seats harnesses and almost no comfort accesories. Its meant to do one thing and thats autocross, its licensed an registered as historic vehicle for driving it to and from the track. Its a saturday afternoon in a park and this is the story.

I was going 30 in a 25 around a blind curve to a 100yard straight that goes into a bridged section near a resevoir. I see the officer is pulled over with another vehicle and he is talking to him. As i approach im deccelerating (keep in mind this is from 30mph) so im coming to a complete stop because theyre blocking both lanes. The cops truck is in one lane an the other car is parked in the other. I come to a compete stop around 20feet from their situation. The cop tells me to pull over and i physically raise my hands like ""what did i even do"" (im thinking it was my exhaust at the time) and he goes ""oh so this is what were doing today?! Youre definitely getting some tickets."" And im legitimately trying to find out. He asks for my license and registration and goes ""you just got caught doing 56 in a 20mph zone"". And i just ask him how he even got that number or how he even plans on proving that in court with no radar or any type of evidence. Obviously this interaction with the officer is not a pleasant one and was completely negative on both ends. Hes yelling at me and im yelling at him. I know this negatively reflects me in court and solves nothing but the officer didnt explain himself at all. He goes back to his car to write the ticket. All the while the car he had originally pulled over is still awaiting his own ticket. He come to me first and shamelessly explains the other kids situation to me in anger. He goes ""i just caught this kid doing the same exact thing you were. But i cant even press charges on him because hes a minor and stole his parents car- *his parents pull up behind me* oh heres his fucking parents"". He stops talking to me and proceeds to explain the situation to them and im overhearing he says he let the kid off because its too much to put on a minor. It would ""ruin his life"" he said. After that the kids dad takes the car and its like a musical chairs of cars. The officer comes back to me in a outrageous tone. He lists of the ticket. 

1- doing 56 in a 20mph zone $290 and 5points
2- Reckless driving (endangering property and persons) $90 and 2 points
3- doing highway speeds in a park $140 and 2 points

I once again ask how. And why the reckless driving. He saw me driving for a mere 20seconds for 100yards decellerating. He goes ""i heard you coming from a mile away, youre literally insulting my intelligence"" and then i go ""why didnt you write me up for my exhaust then?"" He proceeds with ""do you really want that? I can do that if you want"" me going back with ""you cant the cars tagged historic i literally fought this in court 3 months ago"" i know now how big of a dumbass i sounded like at the time. But i did fight it in court and won. Based off of how historic cars dont need to pass emissions. Anyway. I just stop the bullshit and go ""so like how do you have evidence"" and he just walks away ""we will talk about it in court (my name) i hope you have a nice weekend (my name)."" He says this while cutting off my every word. 

Im just dumbfounded. Ive been caught speeding once before 2 years ago and had the absolute nicest conversation with the officer. And i even got a PBJ because of it. I know to be nice to officers. But this was just the most blantant injustice i had ever experienced. 

I have a theory. I honestly believe i got stuck with the ticket from the kid in front of me and the officers ""evidence"" is what he clocked from the kid he had pulled over. He was pissed about having to deal with some teenager. Maybe stressed him out with having to deal with a kid with no real payout. 

I had a passenger and im not even really sure my testimoney in court will ever even hold up. Id probably sound like an asshole just wasting a traffic court session. But i genuinely believe i was put under the bus for some kid.

-the officer was an Enviromental Resource Officer for the park. Whether or not they carry radar equipment in their car im not positive

-i am not sure whether or not there was another officer in the truck with a radar gun

-the officer did not have a gun or laser pointed at me as i was pulling up, he didnt even acknowledge me until i had come to a complete stop. He also did not go back to his vehicle before giving me the 56 in a 20mph zone shpeel. So how he got an accurate reading of 56mph im not sure.

Here's the back-story. Wife and I are in the process of purchasing a house in NY state. We had a local + large septic company come through and perform a thorough inspection of the septic system (including the use of a digital camera probe to snake through the various parts). Of the areas inspected, EVERYTHING failed. The distribution box was so full of roots they could not get the probe any further to inspect the laterals. Current homeowner was there during the inspection and was understandably shocked by the results. She hired a separate company from well outside the area to come in and perform a CONSIDERABLY less thorough inspection where everything passed.

Now what? Does one inspection carry more weight than another? Is this just a negotiating tactic? Has anyone dealt with something like this before? 

Any advice moving forward would be very helpful. I'm happy to provide any further details that might be helpful. A couple other items popped up during inspection that we will also be using during this negotiation phase. Thanks.

EDIT - Negotiations are likely to begin in earnest on Monday. So far only inspection results and estimates for repair have been presented to each other. My current thoughts are to ask both septic inspectors back to the site to further inspect the system (specifically, the distribution box and its connection to laterals). This would force the owner's guy to do a more thorough investigation while also opening up a part of the system for our guy to get a better look.

Thank you for your time reading. 

Last week a storm blew over a neighbors tree, and it crashed onto my chain link fence. When I got home I took a look at it briefly. I knew I was going to have to probably bite the bullet and eat the cost of repairs myself. Everyone on FB, and that Ive spoken to have said that since it's my neighbors tree it's their responsibility. I had to inform them that's not the case, as it is considered an ""act of God"".

The neighbor is in his 90s and is in declining health. In the three years I've lived here I've never seen him. His son left a note on my door leaving his phone number, and apologizing for the damage to the fence. Talked to him briefly and we now communicate via text. A few days later he got back to me abd said we could split the cost of the removal which he had quoted at around 600 dollars. 

I took a much closer look at the tree, thinking about possibly removing it myself. As I looked at the interior of the tree closer I noticed it was rotten. It had split right now the middle, and the entirety of it fell. The remainder is about four feet off the ground. I started looking around the segment that fell. Upon closer inspection I noticed a large cut into the tree; it would have been about seven feet in the air, and was about two feet in length and about a foot deep. 

There is also evidence that a limb was removed a while ago, from a cut off limb. Looking around the back of the property I saw several logs that have been cut down. 

My neighbor wanted to have it removed as soon as possible, and said that his tree guy would remove it in the next few days. He asked me if I would commit to paying for it's removal. I declined. I informed him that I would be having an arborist come and inspect the tree. At that point the sons responses went from ""kind and neighbourly"" to short and passive aggressive. I asked for his father's insurance information, and he said it would take a few days to get it to me. 

Talked to the adjuster and she laughed at me when I said the tree was rotten on the inside. I asked about filing a claim against the insurer and she informed me that it's her judgement that they have no responsibility to pay for removal or repairs.

I haven't communicated with my neighbors son about the chainsaw slice, or the rot on the interior of the tree. My arborist is coming out tomorrow to take a look at it, and give me his opinion. 

My question....is my neighbor responsible for the damage to my property due to negligence in maintaining his property? The slice into the tree with a clean saw cut implies that they knew the tree should be taken down, but because they never finished the removal it weakened the structural integrity of the tree and added a cavity for insects/disease to flourish. 

I had the fence installed and by my calculations from the original quote when it was installed, the repair should be around 700 hundred dollars. I had an estimate for the portion on my property at about 150 for removal. I scanned the county clerk's page and saw that court costs are about two hundred dollars for small claims. 

I have taken tons of pictures, and video for documentation. 

Looking for any and all advice. 

I've never gone to small claims court, so not sure if it's worth going this route. Could I include court costs if I go this route?

Should I inform the son about my intention to go to small claims? I don't know if he is a POA for his father, and truthfully the last thing I want to do is serve an old man with a court summons as he has 24/7 in home care. 

I'd be happy to settle out of court if they cover the removal, and half of the repairs of the fence. Should I convey that sentiment to him?

I've been traveling abroad for a little over a week, and I hired a dog walker / sitter (a guy I've used before via Wag! but booked outside of the system this time) to walk, feed, and do some apartment sitting while I'm gone.

I live in an older multi-unit building in Atlanta with a shared front door. My walker told me that on the first day he was walking my dog (a terrier mix), he opened the front of the building door to encounter two off-leash dogs in the front yard area. One of the dogs (unleashed) began barking and approached my dog, while the walker held my dog (leashed) back. The small dog continued to approach and got into my (restrained) dog's personal space, and was, by their accounts, bitten. Again, this is all according to my dog walker, who I do trust and has already said he will state his account as needed.

Several days later, the owner of the unleashed dog (lives in my building; didn't witness the event; someone else was with outside with her off-leash dog) recognized and approached my walker and, from his recounting of the discussion to me, suggested that she felt my dog was to blame and that the situation would have happened regardless of whether or not her dog was leashed. She said her dog had accumulated substantial (multiple thousands) medical bills and her tone hinted that she felt my dog was unpredictable and potentially broadly aggressive. That's ludicrous; my dog has no history of bites or fights. I've always kept him leashed because it's the law / part of my lease agreement, but also because dogs are dogs and the way they interact depends on the individual dog and the context of the situation. My (leashed) dog has been attacked by an off-leash dog in the past (not documented but happened in my same building with previous neighbors) and I believe he reacted in self-defense this off-leash dog approaching him barking.

I called my property company to ask if there was preserved camera footage of the event; they told me the security camera had not captured any footage and that the other owner had already asked for said footage. I explained to the property rep that my walker had relayed that her dog was off-leash, violating city and county ordinance as well as the pet addendum of our lease (dogs must be leashed). That was a couple of days ago. I've had the sense from afar, based on the tone relayed by my dog walker, that this other owner was trying to make trouble and failing to acknowledge her (I believe) clear negligence that created the situation.

**I just received notice from my property company that they have invoked a clause in the pet addendum of my lease labeling my dog as “behaving in a threatening manner.”** This is one of the reasons listed in my lease under one of the clauses where the Owner has discretion to label and take action. The email also acknowledged their understanding that the other owner's dog was off-leash and stated she too will be receiving notice of violation. The notice gives 5 days to remove my dog from the property or I will be in violation of my lease.

Obviously the nuances of my lease are important here. I'm pissed and upset at another owner's negligence creating a situation and taking a stance damaging to me, and I'm concerned for myself and my dog. I don't believe my dog or my walker is at fault for this situation and it feels like the property company's judgment is an unfounded one aimed at broadly covering their rear because this other (I believe negligent) owner complained. 

It's the weekend and I'm on the other side of the world, and I want to understand my options to protect myself. I won't even be back in the country for 7 days. There's a separate clause in my lease (outside of my pet addendum) about animals that suggests the potential for daily charges of $50 and potential forced removal (following 24-hour notice) of an unapproved animal. I'm not sure whether or not this applies to this situation.

**I'm also trying to prepare myself for some form of suit from the owner of the unleashed dog for damages.** I spoke to a lawyer with respect to that (quick phone consultation) late last week and his perspective was that, given her dog was off leash, she has no legal ground to stand on as far as a case that would make me or my dog liable. But I'm still anxious about the complexities and hassle of the situation and ways it could be spun against me.

**I do have renters insurance with liability coverage -- but I'm now having an issue on that front to.** To my knowledge, no claim has been filed; I called my insurance company the other day to ask about my coverage in a potential situation involving dogs; the net result of that was that they told me I would likely have coverage -- and then 3 days later I received a notice of cancellation because according to them I now have a dog with a bite history. This is not the case; my dog has no history of bites or fights (aside from this recent incident with the off-leash dog, which I don't believe I would be liable for) and my call was purely informational. It's possible they interpreted my questions about potential coverage as a literal and I'm kicking myself for even having the conversation and outlining any circumstances. Maybe I overspoke? I just wanted information and my dog has no documented history of bites. What can I do to argue this? The reason I have coverage is to be protected in potential cases of liability; not to have my policy cancelled when I ask about coverage situations and events.

**I plan to talk with a lawyer on Monday about A) property company and lease violation scenario, B) liability considerations for damages should this owner pursue legal action and C) challenging and correcting my renters insurance company.**

In the meantime I'm open to any perspective that might help me protect my dog, my money, and my housing. I've also never hired a lawyer before and am not confident about how to evaluate or scope (time and money, role of lawyer) for something like this. 

Many thanks to anyone who read this far; know that your time and potential responses are much appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been traveling abroad for a little over a week, and I hired a dog walker / sitter (a guy I&amp;#39;ve used before via Wag! but booked outside of the system this time) to walk, feed, and do some apartment sitting while I&amp;#39;m gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in an older multi-unit building in Atlanta with a shared front door. My walker told me that on the first day he was walking my dog (a terrier mix), he opened the front of the building door to encounter two off-leash dogs in the front yard area. One of the dogs (unleashed) began barking and approached my dog, while the walker held my dog (leashed) back. The small dog continued to approach and got into my (restrained) dog&amp;#39;s personal space, and was, by their accounts, bitten. Again, this is all according to my dog walker, who I do trust and has already said he will state his account as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several days later, the owner of the unleashed dog (lives in my building; didn&amp;#39;t witness the event; someone else was with outside with her off-leash dog) recognized and approached my walker and, from his recounting of the discussion to me, suggested that she felt my dog was to blame and that the situation would have happened regardless of whether or not her dog was leashed. She said her dog had accumulated substantial (multiple thousands) medical bills and her tone hinted that she felt my dog was unpredictable and potentially broadly aggressive. That&amp;#39;s ludicrous; my dog has no history of bites or fights. I&amp;#39;ve always kept him leashed because it&amp;#39;s the law / part of my lease agreement, but also because dogs are dogs and the way they interact depends on the individual dog and the context of the situation. My (leashed) dog has been attacked by an off-leash dog in the past (not documented but happened in my same building with previous neighbors) and I believe he reacted in self-defense this off-leash dog approaching him barking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called my property company to ask if there was preserved camera footage of the event; they told me the security camera had not captured any footage and that the other owner had already asked for said footage. I explained to the property rep that my walker had relayed that her dog was off-leash, violating city and county ordinance as well as the pet addendum of our lease (dogs must be leashed). That was a couple of days ago. I&amp;#39;ve had the sense from afar, based on the tone relayed by my dog walker, that this other owner was trying to make trouble and failing to acknowledge her (I believe) clear negligence that created the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Me and my S/O are facing a situation where bed bugs were introduced into the home by the tenant that lives below us. This was confirmed by the property manager. They started entering our home 3 weeks ago at this point, and as soon as we seen the first one we notified the property manager. They purchased us some over the counter sprays, and then tried an at home heat treatment using large propane (maybe kerosene?) heaters, about 5 days after calling about the bed bug spotting. During this time we had to move majority of our items outside of our home, and package anything upholstered or cloth like in bags and bins. I had to take time off work because they wanted to do it during the day. The heat treatment did not work, and the over the counter sprays were not working either. They finally called an exterminator to get the situation dealt with professionally (1.5 weeks after initial spotting) The exterminator was scheduled to come out to my unit at 3:30 PM, so again I had to take off work (just left a little early that day). The exterminator arrived at the downstairs unit and did his business and then got in his truck and left. Contacted the property manager and let her know that they missed our appointment. However, we had already prepared for him and removed our animals from the location. Another appointment was set up for the following day, at 3:30. Again I left work early to make this appointment. They never showed up. Contacted the property manager again to let her know the situation. Then another appointment was set up the day after, again at 3:30. They called at 5:00PM to let the property manager know that they weren't able to come. She called and complained until they finally got someone to come out to our house at 6:30 and spray. The landlord only paid for 2 of our rooms to be sprayed despite us stating that we had found them in multiple rooms of the house. The exterminator did his business and now its 7 days later and we are still finding bed bugs. We have put a couple that we have found in a plastic bag. We have been living out of garbage bags and bins that we purchased that are air-tight. We have continued to use our over the counter spray, and it does not seem to be working as I am still getting bit. We will have to throw away our brand new furniture and dining room chairs, as that is where we are getting bit at the most it seems. We are unable to take the cushions off the couches, and treat them properly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With the information above, I had done a little bit of research on my own and found that there is a law within the state of Ohio that makes the property owner have to provide us with livable conditions within the home, I searched if bed bugs counted as unlivable conditions and wasn't able to find a clear answer. Do we have the right to withhold rental payment until the situation is resolved?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Please note not sure if this is important to the story - however, we are closing on a house at the end of the month, and we had made a verbal non contractual agreement with the property manager, that so long as we provide a written 30 day notice, and they are able to rent the unit out, they said they will not make us pay rent for the remainder of the lease.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know if you need any additional information, we are feeling trapped at this point, and have had many difficulties sleeping because of the constant fear of bugs and getting bit.

Thanks in advance!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was served a complaint from a credit card company that they’re suing me for about $1600. I honestly forgot about that credit card. I can pay the $1600. So how do I go about trying to achieve a settlement deal? I was hoping to try without a lawyer.

At the time, I was renting a house, and she owned a small condo.  After spending most of our non-working hours together, we decided it made most sense financially for me to ditch the house, and both live in the condo.  A short time later we conceived our daughter, ""C"".

At the time, I had a fledgling business with friends, and did a lot of side jobs.  J had been working for years at a vet clinic, and doing pet sitting on the side, so her schedule was more rigid, and her income more stable than mine.  Because of this, I became the primary caregiver for C.  I got a job at a store nearby, and since have been working 20-30 hrs a week, usually on the days that J is off, or at nights after she comes home.  I do 90% of the cooking and cleaning.  J and I have been together for almost 9 years now, and C is 7 yo.  

C is bright and precocious.  I've done my best to raise her, and I think she has done well, for the most part.  She is an advanced learner and in the upper 90s across the board in testing.  We have a wonderful relationship and are great friends as well as father and daughter.  

All would be well except for one thing:  J has anger management issues, among other less than desirable traits.  She gets in foul moods often, and makes life hell for C and me.  I really would have liked to raise my daughter in an environment where both parents model good behavior, act calmly, and practice what we preach.  J has made this impossible.  J is also a slob, and I do 90% of the cleaning.  

J yells and cusses daily. Every conversation is about who pissed her off that day. She rants with excessive profanity about coworkers, neighbors, about me and C, or whatever she can latch onto.  The ranting is obsessive, so that once she has said her piece, she re-spools the rage and repeats her diatribe again and again.  She also has severe PMS, making about a week out of every month even more intolerable than the rest of the time. 

Her rage makes her an impatient parent to C.  She is more or less level around her most of the time, but sometimes she screams and cusses at her as if she were an adult, most often when I am not home, and I hear about it from C later.  One such time J became so mad she took a dowel from the sliding door and broke it in front of C's face and pointed the sharp end at her.  I confronted her and J cried and apologized, said she was stressed etc and promised to work on her issues.  All was good for a couple months and then she returned to her old ways.

J has never physically hurt C, but the emotional and verbal abuse is far more than anybody, child or adult, should have to put up with, especially in their own home.  Because of this, J and I have had a rocky relationship.  We have argued, made plans, broke plans, come close to breaking up and then made up, made promises, broke promises yadda yadda.

If C was not involved, I would have walked away from J years ago.  But right now, I live in a condo that is in her name, have a joint bank account which she puts more money into, and I am not married to her (for reasons that should be obvious).  

So I am in a very vulnerable position.  My finances are entangled with J's at every level, and I am at the mercy of her poor spending habits.  I have tried to make a budget with her, she says ""we don't have the money to make a budget because we are living paycheck to paycheck"", of course, I have pointed out that making a budget is the first step to fixing that issue, but whenever cornered by logic, she falls back on rage and starts to yell and cuss.  The real fact is that it is her out of control spending that makes us financially unstable.

All of this has lead to me feeling trapped and despondent, unable to change things.  I can't step away, because I don't have the resources to raise C by myself yet, and given that J is the mother and we are not married, I'm worried that courts would side with her should we break up, despite the fact that C has told me repeatedly she wants to be with me.  I cannot walk away and leave J to raise C, but I don't know what to do.  

Things are coming to a head, and J has made threats to kick me out and may make good on them.  I just need to make sure that when I leave, I take C with me.

Background re: my aunt's situation

My aunt is married with 2 adult children [M32 and F25].  She works while her husband does not - he has poor eyesight that is degenerative, and some other ""illness""/""physical disability""  that has prevented him from working for the past 15+ years. Despite his poor health, he has been mentally and even physically abusive of my aunt and her son. I heard from another auntie, that even though someone called the police on the husband (for strangling my aunt), my aunt denied everything when the police came to the house. Over the years, All her siblings have told her to leave him (or to kick him out from her house, and send him packing to his family), but she always ends up going back to him in her house, because she feels guilt and pities him.  Her son is not socially normal because of the mental abuse he has suffered from that monster (he has never worked in his life, and is undergoing psychiatric treatment). Her daughter thinks she still has to respect and look after him, to be a good daughter and religious person

I work in the deli section of a national grocery store chain, for context. I am now considering quitting over an incident that happened yesterday.

Last night, we had one of our pressure fryers severely malfunction. It sent boiling oil spraying in a 3 foot radius around it and the lid slammed upwards hard enough to crack the concrete wall it impacted with. Obviously, if anyone in the shop was unlucky enough to be standing near it, they would have received extreme injuries. Management made an empty promise that they were going to 'fix it sometime' and otherwise didn't do anything. We are still regularly using it in operations afaik.

The whole thing kind of freaked me out. It's a good job with great hours and decent pay, but I'm thinking about quitting tomorrow. I just can't stop picturing what might have happened if I had been standing nearby when it blew. However, my coworkers who have been in the shop for years say that they've never seen it happen before. I googled around and people getting injured over similar malfunctions are few and far between. It seemed to have been a freak accident of sorts and I don't have any reason to believe it might happen again, but the possibility concerns me.

I inherited my mom's house and have been working with her home mortgage lender since I and the estates attorney filed with the county to have my name put on the title (May 2019). Initially, the intent was that I would assume the loan as-is. The closing documents made the loan ineligible for assumption and so I was presented with three options: to keep the loan under my mother's name, to refinance it under my own, or to pay off the loan.

I opted to pay off the loan after some advice from mom's brother and the estate attorney. I contacted the lender on Monday, 24 June and informed them of this decision. The phone rep quoted me the payoff amount and told me that this amount would be good until 23 July. She said that I would receive this in writing in a payoff statement which will include additional information for wiring the funds. I asked her if I would still pay the monthly payment as normal and she said yes and that any overages would be returned in a cheque written out to my mother.  I received the payoff statement on Friday, 28 June. The quote and date were just as the rep had told me. Being Friday evening, and the next week cut with Independence Day, I decided I would wait until 8 July to go to the bank and wire the money.

On Monday, 1 July, I noticed that the autopay for the loan had not come out as it has every month since mom died. The exception was in June, when it came out on the 3rd. The paper invoice had already arrived from the lender, which said that the payment would not be late until 17 July, so I decided to wait until 5 July, again because of the holiday, to pay it manually.

I checked my bank account on 5 July to see if the autopayment had come out, and it had not. It was early in the morning but as many times as I'd called in the past, I knew the automated phone system had a payment option so I thought I'd use that and call back later to ask why autopay wasn't working. After I input the loan number, the automated system informed me that my loan is no longer serviced by their company. It indicated that the last payment received was 3 June, and that was all the information they had, current as of 5 July. It then said good-bye and hung up on me.

I called back again, ensured I used the right loan number, and then called back when they were open. The rep told me that the loan was indeed being serviced by an entirely different company as of 1 July. He gave me the name of the company and their phone number at my request.

I called the new servicer and have discovered that I must start this process all over again. They don't know who I am, so I have to send letters testamentary and the death certificate. This month's mortgage payment still hasn't been paid and I've yet to receive anything in the mail about the servicer change.

This worries me a lot, I did not expect this at all. I'm probably confusing decency and legality, but this behavior feels suspect to me. I contacted my estates attorney about it, but she has yet to respond. I assume she's away for the holiday. My anxiety has made me impatient for advice, thus my post. What I asked the lawyer specifically was:

Should I even bother contacting the previous lender/servicer again to speak to a supervisor about the payoff now that another company is involved? 

What is to stop this new lender/servicer from doing something similar when I again try to pay if off?

Anything else you think I should know would also be appreciated. Thanks again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, thanks for reading.

I'm from South Florida. My mother died in a car accident when I was young. I was in the car with her as was my youngest sister and younger brother. The only one who wasn't was my eldest sister.

We were driving next to a truck on the highway when it began to merge into our lane, hitting our car and knocking us off of the highway. The roof of the car came down on my mom and she was (supposedly) pronounced brain dead.

We sued the company of the truck that hit us (I don't remember what it was) and won $4 million. $1 million going to each of my three siblings and myself as soon as we turned 18.

When I was 17, my dad had me sign something. I didn't know what it was of course, I was young. And he's my dad. I trust him. I later found out what it was and it inhibited me from receiving that money. None of us did. He says he invested it back into our family business. I'm not sure if that's true, I don't believe id get an answer from him if I asked, so I don't.

Im in a situation where I'm completely dependent on him, and I wish I wasn't. He makes it difficult not to be. We all are in a sense, except for my brother.

I know I'm entitled to some of the money when MY mother died. I didn't know what I was signing away. Do I have any rights?

Question: Do I go file a complaint with the state police? Contact an attorney for a lawsuit? Contact the DA to press criminal charges? Do nothing at all? 

Background: About me: Middle aged, pudgy white guy driving a blue sedan.  No criminal history other than a speeding ticket 20 years ago. I have the economic means to take this to an attorney if it is wise.  I live in a TINY town and will routinely see these police officers. 

Story: I was driving about 2 miles away from my house when in the distance I saw blue lights.  I pulled over and no sooner than my car stopped but another state police officer came straight at me from around a corner and blocked me in.  The other cop then pulled behind me.  I knew something was very wrong so I put my hands up.  Cop in the front came out of his car very quickly, drew his gun and pointed it at me, yelling for me to get out of the car.  I gingerly lowered one hand and put my car in park, then opened the door to get out.  

Both cops kept their guns on me and had me raise my shirt, put my hands on my head, walk backwards.  They cuffed me, and while cuffing me I heard the officer that pulled behind me whisper to the other, ""It's not him"".  They put me in the cop car handcuffed while they went to review the dashcam of the officer that pulled behind me.  A couple of minutes elapsed, they came back and took the handcuffs off.  Told me the officer in the back was chasing a blue car, lost him, saw me, and that it was a case of mistaken identity.  They asked me if I was ok, I told them I was very shaken up, and they told me to wait in my car for a supervisor.  

About 5-10 minutes passed, a ton more cops showed up...totaling 7 cars now, and then the officer that stopped me from the front came to me and told me I was free to go.  They never asked me who I was, checked my driver's license, or even searched me before putting me in the cop car.  All those things tell me that they knew immediately they had the wrong guy. A supervisor never did talk to me.  

So, what do I do? I called a cop friend who told me to go file a complaint, that initiating a felony stop without probable cause is not right and that they should be made to at least explain their actions.  They should have had a good look at the driver, partial license plate+car color etc.  I am hesitant to rekindle a situation that is over.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location: NC, USA&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

On July 1st, I agreed to purchase a new car from the dealership and filled out the handwritten credit application with $8,000 monthly income.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 2nd, I bring a cashier's check for the down payment. With the cashier's check and trade-in, around 20% of the total cost of the purchase is financed. I was told by the finance manager that 2 out of the 3 banks declined to provide finance due to high debt-to-income ratio. I sign the paperwork and drive off with the car.

&amp;#x200B;

On July 4th, I noticed on the copy of the typed credit application has my income as $8,000 yearly income. I contact my salesperson for a copy of the handwritten credit application and was told that the accounting office was not available that day. On July 5th, I called the salesperson back and was that they don't have a copy of the handwritten credit application. I was forwarded to the finance manager and was told that they were certain that the income was submitted to the banks as $8,000 monthly. I decide to call the bank loan underwriter that finalize the loan and was told that the dealership actually submitted the income as $800 monthly. They knew the loan would not get approved so without contacting the dealership to verify they assumed it was an error and added an extra zero at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

The interest rate on the loan is higher than any of my previous auto loans and the finance manager also extended the term of the loan to get a lower interest rate. I decided to get the payoff details and closed the loan to stop accruing $6 interest each day.

&amp;#x200B;

Can I get a copy of the credit application with the information that was actually submitted to the 3 banks? I prefer to verify the information that the finance manager sent to the banks than to just trust that they did. I will be meeting with the finance manager in person to figure out how this even happened. The copy of the credit application that the finance manager gave to me does not match what they said and I would like to know if the two other banks that declined due to ""High debt-to-income ratio"" did receive the income as $800 monthly and did not fix the error and added a zero at the end of the income. I have never missed any payments. They use a software called ""RouteOne"" that I am assuming sends the same credit application to all the banks. Honestly, this would not have been an issue if the copy of the credit application matched what I wrote on the handwritten credit application.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;X post from &lt;a href=""/r/personalfinance""&gt;r/personalfinance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Recently moved this last week. Yesterday a package was supposed to have been, and was marked, delivered to the new address. When it wasn't, we contacted the postal service who said that the carrier had not delivered it to the house because we do not have a curbside mailbox. This carrier left a letter for us in our withheld mail saying so, which we didn't get, because they didn't deliver any mail to us. No contact was made with us in the first weeks of moving here by the postal service to explain anything.

For clarification, the street I live on is approximately 2 blocks long and nobody, I went out and looked, has a curbside mailbox. I even watched the mail carrier physically walk to the mailboxes mounted on each person's house, just like the one that is mounted to my house. When they went past mine I asked to speak with them and they said they didn't have time and just kept walking. 

When my wife went to pick up the package, there was a letter, that was also withheld from our physical address, explaining that 21 years ago the postal service changed rules to make it so everyone has to have a curbside mailbox. Well, the previous tenants of this house only lived here for 3 years, and our neighbors expressed they've both been in the neighborhood for less than 10, and they've never been told they needed to change mailboxes. Is it worth trying to contact the local postmaster to see what the deal is? I don't like how they didn't even leave anything at my house to say that mail was being held from delivery, there was zero communication until we tried to locate the ""delivered"" package. 

It should be noted, although maybe not relevant, we live on a one way street, where no traffic is allowed to park on one side, resulting in the other side that would need the mailbox, to almost always have someone parking on front of it. If the effort is, like the letter stated, to allow employees to not have to exit their vehicle to deliver mail and streamline the process, it's not going to work on this street by default of design. 

Tldr; recently moved, mail is being withheld from delivery until we install a curbside mailbox despite nobody else having one.

My girlfriend and her roommate recently tried to move into a recently ""renovated"" apartment in NYC Harlem area. They saw the apartment while it was being renovated but saw another unit that showed the finished product. The apartment was supposed to be ready by July 1st as signed by the lease agreement. The Landlord contacted my girlfriend and her roommate saying there was water damage on the dry wall a and it would be fixed by the time they would move in. Fast forward the drywall wasn't fixed and the water damage was still present. Apparently the water damage occurred due to a leaky roof, which the landlord still hasn't addressed yet. The repair in my opinion was a sham, the contractor/super that was hired essentially just spackled over the dried, damaged, wall and painted it (instead of removing the drywall to check for any damages in the interior wall). The paint in my girlfriend's room had fumes that were too strong making her and her roommate to sleep in their old apartments in Jersey.

There were other things not ready (dirty walls in another room, faucet incorrectly placed that had to be repaired in the bathroom). At this point, I have very little confidence this landlord will improve the situation and even address what the super claimed was a leaky roof. She's documenting everything in terms of photos and e-mails, but I'm wondering if the situation does not improve what would be the best course of action? They already paid 1st month's rent and security.

I heard from some people (who are not lawyers) don't pay the rent, ask for this month free, call 311, or sue. Not sure what the best course of action is.

In the interim, I'm helping her find apartments around their price range in case they have to move out and void their lease agreement.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, &lt;/p&gt;

Myself and my roommate (I'll call him Tom) were both on the lease. I lived there for a year and signed a renewal for another year. Then several months later I found an opportunity in a new city and moved out.

Before moving out I found a replacement to sublet until the lease expired. The lease expired and I was told my name was not on the new lease agreement.

Fast forward to about a month ago. Tom contacted me (the one I signed with). He said he had moved out but had been subletting this apartment ever since. He also told me me the apartment changed hands and there was no record of the lease transfer, furthermore his name dropped off the renewals and only mine remained. He's been signing lease renewals with only my name for several years, but apparently my name had been on the lease the entire time.

The reason he contacted me is because he had some trouble with sudden tenant departures and was unable to fill a spot and was late with a rent payment. A notice was sent to the apartment addressed to me. The tenants became alarmed since they had been paying rent to somebody who wasn't even on the lease agreement.

Tom needed me to contact the management company to try to pay the last month's rent from the deposit (management refused to talk to him since he is not on the lease). I called them to do my own research and get all the lease renewals they had on file. He's been forging my signature since 2010.

I told Tom to get current on the rent and worry about the deposit later, which he says he did. I got the contact info for the tenants living there. I contacted them and explained the situation. They thought Tom was just taking the rent money and not paying it. I told them he's just an idiot but was current on the rent. I put them in contact with the apartment management to apply for the lease and get it transferred. The conversation was amicable. My main concern is that my name from the lease or course, I figured they could hash out the details of rent/deposits/etc.

The lease expired Sunday, I reached out to the tenants on Tuesday to see if they were successful in getting the lease all figured out. I got a text back saying: ""my lawyer is going to be handling all of this. Thank you.""

So do I need to get a lawyer? I don't think I've done anything wrong here but I'm afraid I'm the one still legally responsible for the apartment. I doubt anyone is going to be paying the rent for July. I'm hesitant to speak to Tom again for fear of appearing like I'm colluding with him, which I'm not. I've been very honest with everyone I've spoken to about the whole situation, so maybe that's where I went wrong.

CANADA, B.C.

My mom was experiencing knee pain stemming from tight hips and a doctor recommended for her to see a physiotherapist. So she booked the appointment with the PT at a brand new clinic that was nearby our house.

She had the appointment and the PT thought the best way to treat her tight hip / knee pain was to do some sessions of “dry needling”

During her first session, she found it extremely painful to the point where she was shaking and crying at the pain that the needles brought to her hip where the needles were being punctured into her.

Due to the excruciating pain of the first session she cancelled all remaining sessions and decided to find other ways of treatment.

She found that after the treatment of dry needling that her pain was actually getting worse and it was no longer her knee that was bothering her but instead a pain that would shoot through her right leg.

Eventually, the pain becomes unbearable and she finds her self needing to go to the hospital after the pain progressively intensifies day after day.

And so now here we are at the hospital and the doctors have found that she has inflammation DEEP in her muscle at the location of where the dry needling took place.
The doctor also mentioned that there’s a good chance that the needle they used had bacteria on it and in turn infected deep in her hip/pelvic muscles.

And so, we’re wondering if suing the new clinic / PT is worth considering? Negligence? Malpractice? We don’t really know really if we there’s anything here 🤷🏻‍♂️

TLDR:
Mom goes to physiotherapist to get dry needling done. 
Ends up getting worse. 
Goes to the hospital. 
Doctors tell us that the muscle where needle was injected is now severely inflamed/infected and needle that was used most likely had bacteria causing infection.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s the situation. CANADA, B.C.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Will be potentially taking a contractor to small claims court un the greater Detroit area, was curious what sort of recourse I have before moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

We hired a someone a little over a month and a half ago to fix a leak in our roof which had been dripping into the kitchen through a small hole in the ceiling. Heavy rain in our area over the past couple months made it difficult to hire someone I know/had been recommended due to lack of availability, so we ended up using a referral service through our realtor (who also happened to be a friend of ours).

&amp;#x200B;

The contractor who was connected with us came out and recommended replacing a section of shingles which he quoted at $550, $200 deposit and $350 on completion. His team came out at the start of June, worked for a day, said the job was completed and accepted the $350. A few days later we had a rainstorm and our ceiling was still leaking. I reached back out to the guy and informed him that we were still taking on water so he scheduled another time to come out and look a few days later. The appointment came and passed and he no called/no showed.

&amp;#x200B;

We continued to reschedule &amp; no call/no showed 2 more times, each time I would have to call multiple times after to see what happened. A little over two weeks after the second appointment was scheduled, he said sent someone out while I was at work and they filled in some holes which had appeared near the site they worked on. I did not see anyone come out and when I called the contact he stated that they must have just left.

&amp;#x200B;

We had a rainstorm again a few days later which again leaked through the initial hole and started coming through a recessed light fixture near the same spot as well. I called the guy back and he said he would come out and personally fix the section, however he (unsurprisingly) no called no showed on that appointment as well. At this time, I also received a call back form a far more reputable team who I had contacted previously about fixing our roof with a potential opening, so I figured I could finally cut ties with this guy. Last week I spoke with him on the phone about getting a refund for the payment as the roof was still leaking, agreed on letting him keep the deposit and returning the $350 just so we could be done with everything. The agreement was that he would return the money by this past Friday or I would file a suit for the full amount plus damage done on the house since he started the job, but (again unsurprisingly) he no called no showed yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan is to file a suit this coming week, looking for it to be around $1550 in small claims court ($550 for the payment, will have an official estimate and adjust accordingly but unofficially we're looking at about $1000 in damages from the continued leaks in the ceiling). I do not have any experience with the system, hoping someone else who might would be able to advise whether this would be worth my time or if this is a sunk cost. Let me know if additional information is needed and thanks in advance for any advice that is provided!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All,&lt;/p&gt;

I have a few days to appeal the THP decision that I don't have to relocate. Should I appeal? And if so, can I get the hell out for the 3 months without paying rent? Can we break the lease sooner?

As far as I understand I don't have these options, but would it be better to try and negotiate with the management company/landlord before appealing?

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

Sis separated from the father(X) when he started hitting her in front of Daughter. 

They have maintained a 50/50 custody split (1st half of week w/ one parent; 2nd half with other) although they don't have money for a lawyer and don't have a written custody agreement. 

X this week refused to give up custody of Daughter and made the claim that Daughter had reported to him and his mother who watches her that she had been touched inappropriately by Sis's new boyfriend of 6 months.  Without going into too much detail, I have **strong** reason to doubt that Daughter said any such thing(I'll give more detail in a top level comment), but (rightly) a detective was brought in to interview Daughter and a medical examination (on the level of a physical) was performed. Both avenues failed to indicate any impropriety. X's mother also refuted the claim that Daughter told her what X claimed. The police investigation is done, but CPS will (rightly) be following up.

&amp;#x200B;

X continues to refuse to give back custody to Sis.

&amp;#x200B;

**Legal Questions**:

What recourse does Sis have to regain custody and enforce their informal agreement of the past two years?

&amp;#x200B;

What legal rights does X have in refusing to give up custody?

&amp;#x200B;

What resources would you suggest for her as she cannot afford a lawyer?

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any knowledge of what the CPS interactions will look like?

Later, I come back to Singapore with the IPA letter of my employment pass. When I arrived in SG, my doctor informed me that I got active pulmonary TB and must undergo a 6-month length treatment program. With the doctor memo, I told the HR dept, and then they decide to delay my starting working date and try to clarify if I am fit-to-start-working. I make a horrible mistake when I assume the IPA letter as an official pass when I saw the date on it. It was too late when I go to ICA and ask them for a short-term visit pass to continue receiving TB treatment while my company cant clear the medical status, my EP application was not submitted to MOM as I guessed.

ICA discovered I already overstayed while issuing the short-term pass. They investigated me after that. After letting me finish my treatment, they closed the case with a warning letter and repatriated me. My IO advised me to send an appeal through the ICA email address, if the appeal success, I can print the permission letter to get in Singapore.

Trouble getting bigger after ICA informed MOE my case. MOE demands me to pay a full contract payment after assuming me breach the service agreement to work for Singapore companies within 3 years (I signed the agreement for the down school fee payment when studied at NTU). I have sent the appeal by my self and got rejected the 2nd times. I already contact a lawyer for this case, they are working on it. My NTU convocation in this July, I literally cant attend.

First time Subaru owner. San Jose, CA United States

Since i've owned the car I always heard a faint popping noise from the drivers side front end. I mentioned it to the dealership in passing  while I was in having them look at an issue with my A/C unit not getting cold (this was one week after purchasing the vehicle). They said it was normal function for the car. This was 8 or so months ago. Came in for another warranty repair on my A/C since a friend and I discovered some fluid on my firewall near the A/C. The shop actually did diagnostics at this point and found that 3 o-rings were faulty. During this visit they noted the clicking sound and stated that it is normal operation of the car to have such noise, or stated it was due to aftermarket parts being installed. I added new wheels, springs and spacer blocks to my suspension, the sound persists.

I went to dealership yesterday to have them listen for the sound and the mechanic confirmed what I was hearing. They came back to me and said that they can't do any diagnostics or repairs on my shocks or struts until the car is put back to stock. They said contact Subaru of America and ask if they will cover putting the car back to stock, then they will look at it. Subaru of America is backing the dealership's decision to not investigate my car until it is put back to stock. This would require me to pay money for the dealership to put stock parts back on and then pay again to have my desired parts returned to the vehicle. Their claim is that they can't prove that their part is faulty until after market parts are taken off the car.

Is the dealership by law allowed to claim that my aftermarket parts made this shock go bad without investigating?  They missed the A/C diagnosis the first time and they missed diagnosing the noise. While investigating myself I found a lot of rust and small corrosion under the dust cap of the shock. In the 2018 models they had a warranty issue for this exact problem (Technical bulletin 05-62-18). Common sense tells me that wheels, springs and lift spacers can in no way cause rust to happen. Can they state as matter of fact without investigating?

&amp;#x200B;

So now I am lost and not sure how to pursue the next steps in this process. I did find that the FTC states ""simply using an aftermarket or recycled part does not void your warranty. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act makes it illegal for companies to void your warranty or deny coverage under the warranty simply because you used an aftermarket or recycled part.""

There is nothing in the HOA bylaws that explicitly prohibits subletting to a sex offender.  The townhouse community accepts FHA mortgages; so there may be additional fair housing regulations that require compliance.

If I don't take my meds I have horrible withdrawals. I end up shaky and puking and can barely eat, walk or sleep from pain and discomfort. But it's the only medicine that works so I take it, plus it's never caused me problems as long as I take it regularly.

That's where the problems start.

My doctor's office (well, old therapy office) has been horrible with filling my prescription. Given that I can only get it from them they have to sign saying yes, I am supposed to be taking this and they can fill it. We've asked them to for almost a week now and they haven't signed.

It's not like they've said no, they just... Haven't responded at all. They're waiting for them to say ANYTHING at this point. Im lucky my mom is on a less powerful, different kind of the same drug, because while it does nothing for my anxiety it keeps the withdrawals at bay.

I don't have energy. I always want to sleep. I need my meds but I can't FORCE them to call back and sign. This is the second or third time they've done this to me, the first two times I was left shaking and puking in bed for several days. I don't know what to do.

Whether I can do anything or not, I don't know. But I would love to know if they're allowed to do this or not. We don't have the money to sue but if we did I definitely would.

Her situation from what I gather is She is unemployed, has zero work experience, has not payed any child support since signing away custody to me and Recently announced she is pregnant, with Her and boyfriend living in her grandparents house.

Obviously as the primary caregiver of my daughter I am far from impressed. The mother has the right to do whatever she wants with her life ....but from the point of view of the best interest of our child this is just BS. Clearly she is making no effort or in any way putting our child first in her decision making to try and be a mom and now she is willing to bring another child into this world who will probably be equally neglected.

So I was on Yelp looking at reviews of local businesses and I began to notice that a lot of Yelp Users only give 1 or 5 star reviews and rarely give  2-4 star reviews.  They're also not thorough reviews.  One of the biggest things I've noticed when it comes to bad reviews is that reviewers will complain about how bad the service was or how bad the food was but they don't say anything about how management handled their issues.

I think this is a big issue because these reviews could possibly jeopardize the livelihood of the employees and business owners.

Slander in some cases.

Two weeks ago, I bought a used iPhone XR on Facebook Marketplace. I met a husband and wife at a local coffee shop and exchanged pleasantries. The husband works for the same large company as I do, and the wife works for a local hospital. I later looked up the husband in my employee directory, and he is who he says he is, they're not making any efforts to conceal their identities. I tried the SIM card in my phone and it worked with no issues, I pay them.

The phone used to be active on Sprint, but it was (according to them) purchased outright, so it should work with all US carriers. I am on AT&amp;T.

Fast forward to yesterday, and the new phone loses network access and stops working. I called AT&amp;T support on my Fiancee's phone, and they told me that the device was reported lost or stolen, and there was nothing they could do to bring it back online. I ran a report on the device, and it was reported as ""Ever blacklisted"", but not ""Currently blacklisted"" by a reputable phone checking service. I did check the SN/IMEI when I bought the phone and it was all clear. I even put the SIM card back into my original phone, and it doesn't work there now either.

Frustrated, I contacted the sellers again, and they have been very responsive, claiming that they never reported the device lost or stolen, and reaffirming that the device was owned wholly by them with no payment plan on it at the time of its sale to me. They sent me transcripts of chats with Sprint support, affirming that they do not have any outstanding holds on the device. That's all well and good, but I still am not able to use my new phone as intended. AT&amp;T says the issue is not on their end, so they can't do anything about it, but Sprint says there is no issue at all, so they can't do anything. This is maddening.

The phone's serial number and IMEI were published in the original Facebook marketplace ad, is it possible that someone else reported this device lost or stolen for a laugh? I know that seems like a wild theory, but I'm just trying to figure out how I got into this situation.

I know that many will say, ""They're scamming you!"", but it seems so unlikely that someone scamming me would use their real Facebook page, their real names, continue to talk to me after the fact, and tell me that they work for the same company as me when I could easily look up where he works and go to his desk at the office.

**TLDR**: Three separate incidents have occurred with three separate black employees with a common manager. All of us seemingly treated differently than other employees. Two of us were told we were stealing time, one of us was told we were unprofessional. One of us quit, one of us quit before being officially terminated, one of us was terminated. All three of us were targeted by this manager as not meeting his standard in some way without a clear metric as to what that standard was. We all feel as if we were not treated equally in regards to our coworkers.

**The Story:**

* \- I was hired/contracted with this company starting in March 2019. My manager did not see me before hiring me, he interviewed me over the phone.
* \- In this time I noticed that other employees were receiving 1:1 meetings with the manager but he was not scheduling them with me. He and I had very little interaction other than daily pleasantries as a result.
* \- At the beginning of May 2019, he texted me after hours (around 7:30P) requesting that I join him in a conference room at the beginning of the next day. I did not know whose number it was as I had received no prior communication from it.
* \- Regardless, I checked the conference room the next morning. My manager was there and presented me with an excel spreadsheet of all of the times that my computer was ""active"" as well as my browser history and claimed that with this data the most I was working was 3-4 hours a day and I had ""stolen"" $12,000 worth of company time.
* \- In the same meeting, he also accused me of performing illicit activity on my computer, but refused to tell me what it was , saying only ""Just know I can see everything that you're doing"".
* \- He then revoked my ability to work remotely and told me to leave my work laptop in the building, citing that he couldn't trust me, sent me home for the day, and told me we would meet up again to discuss a plan for improvement

**Advice:** I honestly don't know what to do in this situation but three individuals have now lost their livelihood as a result of this man's actions. I do not want this to continue happening. I would love justice for myself, I do believe he had a fair reason to fire me as I violated agreed upon terms (despite how I feel that should have been handled) but my concern is not with that it is with the way I was treated differently while employed and that others will be hired and then subsequently treated differently and/or let go due to possible discrimination. I have been told to go to the EEOC, I have been told to get an Employment Attorney, I have been told to get a Discrimination Attorney. Please help - do I have a case for any of those things?

EDIT: Grammar and additional details.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the background - I am a Muslim, African American man, in Missouri, who was contracted as an IT Project Consultant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt;: Three separate incidents have occurred with three separate black employees with a common manager. All of us seemingly treated differently than other employees. Two of us were told we were stealing time, one of us was told we were unprofessional. One of us quit, one of us quit before being officially terminated, one of us was terminated. All three of us were targeted by this manager as not meeting his standard in some way without a clear metric as to what that standard was. We all feel as if we were not treated equally in regards to our coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- I was hired/contracted with this company starting in March 2019. My manager did not see me before hiring me, he interviewed me over the phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- In this time I noticed that other employees were receiving 1:1 meetings with the manager but he was not scheduling them with me. He and I had very little interaction other than daily pleasantries as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- At the beginning of May 2019, he texted me after hours (around 7:30P) requesting that I join him in a conference room at the beginning of the next day. I did not know whose number it was as I had received no prior communication from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Regardless, I checked the conference room the next morning. My manager was there and presented me with an excel spreadsheet of all of the times that my computer was &amp;quot;active&amp;quot; as well as my browser history and claimed that with this data the most I was working was 3-4 hours a day and I had &amp;quot;stolen&amp;quot; $12,000 worth of company time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- In the same meeting, he also accused me of performing illicit activity on my computer, but refused to tell me what it was , saying only &amp;quot;Just know I can see everything that you&amp;#39;re doing&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- He then revoked my ability to work remotely and told me to leave my work laptop in the building, citing that he couldn&amp;#39;t trust me, sent me home for the day, and told me we would meet up again to discuss a plan for improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Upon going home, I contacted my mentor at the company: an older African American gentleman, also a contractor, who also worked for some the same manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- After telling my mentor the story, my mentor told me that the manager, a few months prior, contacted him after hours, accused him of working limited hours, and intimidated him with threats of &amp;quot;recording his screen&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- Upon my return to work the next day, the manager acted as if nothing had happened. This coyness continued for the next month. He did not lay out a performance improvement plan or set up a meeting to discuss further action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;- We return to exchanging daily pleasantries, and I get curious if he simply forgot what occurred. I waited for him to set up a meeting of some sort to discuss an improvement plan but nothing ever occurs.&lt;/li&gt;

My two main jobs are working the cash and keeping the fridge stocked. To do the latter, I frequently have to go downstairs to the larger walk-in fridge to grab more crates of beer. I’m a small person and these crates are decently  heavy for me, but I try to move as fast as I can because there’s no other support in the shop - I’m the only person working the cash, so customers have to wait while I’m downstairs grabbing  supplies. On busy days, a line starts to build if I take too long. It’s our busy season right now, so things are particularly hectic - I’d estimate I go downstairs for beer anywhere from 15-30 times a night. There’s almost always a line, so I’m under pressure to move quickly.

Lately, there has been a TON of water on the stairs, as well as at the bottom of the stairs, all over the floor on the way to the walk-in, and sometimes inside the fridge as well. I’m talking HUGE pools of water, and large parts of the floor just straight-up covered in it. I’ve seen FOH staff making attempts to mop it up but they barely make a dent. Last night one of the servers was just kinda squishing it with a mop at one point.

In the past, sometimes a little water will leak out of the brewery and onto the stairs, and someone will mop/put up a Caution sign until it dries and that’ll be the end of it. But this is different, and feels very dangerous to me. I worked six hours last night and there were significant pools of water all over the place for the entirety of my shift. Every time I went downstairs I could not avoid stepping in it/getting my shoes wet. I was taking little tiny baby steps everywhere to avoid slipping. I asked a few people what the water was from and got vague answers/guesses - “condensation,” brewery runoff, maybe a plumbing issue? No one really seems to know.

Management at this place is well-meaning but a bit scattered and historically slow to act when there’s a problem. I have a friendly relationship with the owner who oversees retail stuff but he’s not always there on the days when I work. Still, I have now pointed this issue out to him multiple times. The first time I told him I was uncomfortable taking heavy crates up and down the stairs while they were wet and he said absolutely, your safety comes first, don’t do it until they’re dry. The second time, I was like “wow the stairs are really wet, huh?” and he said something like “Yeah, be careful!” But the past three times I’ve worked, the stairs have never dried and I literally have no other option - I have to go up and down them in order to perform my duties. There is no “waiting until they’ve dried” or until I feel safe.

This whole situation just feels ripe for something to go wrong and I’m wondering what I should do to protect myself. One friend has suggested I send an email to management about the situation so there’s a paper trail that shows I brought the issue to their attention, plus maybe it’ll push them to act. Another said if I’m not wearing proper “kitchen shoes” &amp; I slip and fall, my employer wouldn’t be legally liable for it, though no one there has ever given me guidelines/rules about the kind of footwear I should be wearing (besides “close-toed”). Is there anything else I should be specifically doing to encourage management to deal with this, and/or to protect myself in case something does go wrong?

Last night I went to my friends house for the fourth. I was wearing short shorts and came home around midnight. Which really set him off because I guess he thought I was with another man.

Background: My sibling and I are 9 years apart and I am currently 20. We are both Canadian citizens but I live in Toronto while they live abroad with my parents. My parents are still married and both legal parents of my sibling. 

For the past few years my sibling has been visiting me during summer and winter breaks in Canada. Mostly just for fun, going to camp etc. Its mostly been good but I have noticed that because I am technically not their guardian, it makes things a bit more complicated when I have to take them to the doctors or even go on rides. I was wondering if it’s at all possible for me to apply to be a third guardian? Have there ever been precedents? I have a great relationship with my parents and my sibling so it’s not urgent or an extreme necessity, but it would make our lives much easier.

I looked at the application for guardianship and it seems like I have to basically sue my parents but that’s not really what I want. I just want to be a joint guardian with them considering I basically have to look after my sibling a couple months out of the year anyways.

I just turned 59 today. I'm working a summer job as a camp host. For the months of April and May, I worked clearing campgrounds. Most of the time I was pushing a large, leaf blower. It is built like a roto-tiller, but has a giant blower mounted on the engine instead. The way this one was designed, it transferred all of the heavy vibrations straight up to my hands. Yes, I did wear gloves, even special gloves with gel padding. After two months of pushing that thing over 40 hours a week, my left pinky finger started to get a catch in it. When I wake up in the morning, my pinky finger doesn't want to open. Only after I really strain it will it then suddenly pop open. The same thing happens when I try to close my hand. The pinky won't go... won't go... won't go... then pops closed. It's as if there is a knot or scar on the tendon and it doesn't want to go through that little band that holds the tendon in place. Then, when enough force is applied, that knot pops under that band.

It does hurt pretty bad, but is not excruciating. After I have used my hand for a couple of hours, it's as if that knot has been mashed down and the band has stretched some. The pinky then functions normally, but I can still feel the knot popping under that band. If I don't use my hand for an hour or so, like when reading or watching TV, then the band tightens up and the popping gets worse. This cycle repeats every day. In addition, both hands are still really sore, even after over a month. 

To my boss's credit, as soon as I showed him what my pinky was doing, he let me stop using the blower. Though I still had to do lots of other physical work with that hand. 

I know I will have to go see a doctor and get a diagnosis before I can file a claim. One problem is that I will have to not open my hand all day before my appointments, so the doctor will be able to fully see the damage. 

Some may say, ""What's the problem?"" The problem is that my finger didn't do this before. It's been over a month and it isn't getting better. I am not normally a physical labor kinda guy. My degree is in computer science. I type a lot (can you tell?). I often operate precision equipment like cameras or small tools. The use of my hand is definitely impaired. I shouldn't have to put up with this the rest of my life just because leaves needed to be removed from campgrounds. 

I'm not hoping to have won the workman's comp lottery with this, but I do feel I should be compensated. And it's not as if I have a lot of money. Even a couple hundred dollars a month would make a big difference for me. 

**Here's my question:** Would it even be worth it to go to all the trouble and expense to get a diagnosis and file a claim? Would I have to go through one of those law offices that specialize in workman's compensation just to have any hope of getting my claim through? How much would they take?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.mass.gov/guides/the-attorney-generals-guide-to-landlord-and-tenant-rights""&gt;https://www.mass.gov/guides/the-attorney-generals-guide-to-landlord-and-tenant-rights&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/09/11/105cmr410.pdf""&gt;https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/09/11/105cmr410.pdf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;(E) Every openable exterior window shall be capable of being secured.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we use this to force the landlord to fix the windows?  How do we get the landlord to cooperate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance for your advice!&lt;/p&gt;

I racked up a lot of surchargeable offenses my first year here (nothing serious, just scraping bumpers and a few tickets here and there). Back in March I was pulled over in Cambridge for an expired inspection sticker (I couldn’t afford to get my car inspected and I knew I’d have to make a bunch of repairs I also couldn’t afford but I needed a car to get to work and school). The cop told me I had 20 days to dispute the ticket which I wanted to do because getting another moving violation would result in my license being suspended. I went to send in the ticket with the fee to dispute it, but it said on the ticket I needed to send it back in the original envelope in order to do so. I couldn’t find the envelope anywhere, so I went to do it online, which it says you can do through the Cambridge gov website. When I typed in my license number and the citation number, it said there was no record of the ticket. I tried both paying it and disputing it, and there was no record of it at all. I thought I lucked out and the cop didn’t report it so I forgot about it and moved on with my life. 

Then I got a letter sent to my old address which I just received last week saying I needed to take a drivers’ retraining course to avoid suspension of my license before 8/04. I logged on to register for the class and the soonest date offered was 8/04, meaning I wouldn’t be able to avoid suspension. I called the course to ask what the offense was and they said I was found responsible for a moving violation in March. I said I tried to dispute it but there was no record of the ticket. They said it had been reported to the RMV and I was found responsible, but I was never notified of this or given the opportunity to dispute it because it was never posted. I even called the Cambridge courthouse and they said there was no record of that ticket. 

I called the RMV again to let them know this and they said my license was already suspended until 8/04. However, on the letter I received, it said my license WOULD be suspended unless I took a class before that date, not that it already was. I received no notice that my license was being suspended for a ticket that was never reported through the proper channels. I’m told I can request a hearing at the RMV which I plan on doing Monday. I have screenshots proving there was no record of the ticket within the required 20 days it needed to be posted and the letter saying I could avoid suspension of my license by taking a class before 8/04. 

I live in an area with little to no access to public transport, so it’s vital for me to have a license in order to get to work. In addition, I won a Fulbright scholarship to teach in Malaysia for 10 months starting 1/1/2020 which required me to have and International Drivers’ license, which I can’t receive or apply for with a suspended license.

In addition, I won a Fulbright scholarship to teach in Malaysia for 10 months starting 1/1/2020 which required me to have and International Drivers’ license, which I can’t receive or apply for with a suspended license. It seems like several improper actions were taken here. My question is what can I do to get my license reinstated as quickly as possible. Would love some help. Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

My former employer is appealing the benefits I received for a brief period several months ago. Hearing is set for next week. I will have to arrive early as they did not provide me with a copy of the case file.

The issues to be discussed at the hearing are:

* UI Code Section 1030/32- Should the employer's reserve account be charged for any benefits paid to claimant.

* UI Code Section 1256- Did the claimant voluntarily leave his or her most recent employment with good cause. Was the claimant discharged for misconduct connected with his or her most recent work.(See UI Sections 1256, 1256.1, 1256.2, 1256.5)

The situation was that I was working full time when had a situation arise where my child, who has a psychiatric disorder, was having difficulty in school, aftercare, with friends, etc., and was temporarily suspended from aftercare. First, I requested to just leave early the rest of the suspension week, but it quickly became apparent my child required more attention. I asked if it was possible to work part time and was told it was. A month later, I was told it no longer possible for me to continue there part time due to budgetary reasons and was given a one month notice for my termination.

First time poster on this sub, and I'm not really sure anything can be done but perhaps I just need to hear it from someone else.

So for context, I \[22, M\] live on a mostly non-residential street. I don't go to bed until midnight or past it, so sometimes my dog's last potty (I don't have a yard, so it's always an on-leash affair) isn't until then or just before it. My dog is the literal definition of anal retentive; she's a shelter dog, and pretty skittish, so sometimes getting her to poop is difficult. I tried walking her down a nearby street, but even at night, it can still be fairly trafficked, and even the occasional car passing by (especially if it's loud) can be enough of a distraction to make her just want to go home, thereby constipating herself until morning where she hopefully poops—but even then, morning traffic can be equally distracting, ""spooky,"" and otherwise enough to cause her to withhold dropping trou. Additionally, that late at night there can be some unsavory folks on that street who appear either drugged out or just give me bad vibes. However, the street intersecting my corner is a nice, quiet cul-de-sac, with a bunch of industrial and small-time commercial buildings with 0 activity past like 6pm, so for some months I've been walking her down that at night, and she has generally no problem going. Things are great.

Enter houseless guy (HG). For maybe the last month or so, he's been driving over to this quiet cul-de-sac at night (I'm not sure when, I'm sure it varies a bit; sometime past 6 and before 10-11 probably?) to sleep in his car. Which would probably be fine for him, except he has a little yappy dog that goes ape when I walk my dog past, even if I try to be as quiet as possible. I'm sure it's waking him up at least sometimes; I'm sure that sucks. I try to avoid his car when I can (i.e. doubling back instead of walking past), but holy shit is my dog particular about where she will and won't shit. And hell, sometimes the dog starts going nuts across the street. Regardless, I try to be amicable and do as little damage to his sleep schedule as possible. I'm sure if this was r/AmItheAsshole I would get a rating of ""Everybody Sucks Here"" from some, and I'm willing to take that.

I always worried he'd be upset enough to pull something the way he yelled at his dog to shut up, and tonight I saw that culminating, or at least threatening to. After I walked my dog past, and I was some ways around the other side of the street, I heard the door to his minivan slam shut. Loudly. HG is walking his dog around. I'm walking opposite the way he's going, but of course his dog (too dark to see the dog, but definitely small from the bark) is going wild. Which is when he starts shouting at me things like ""That's right!"" ""That's fucking right!"" like he's egging his dog on, and then he follows that with something along the lines of ""Next time, I'll let my dog loose!"" I'm still a bit shaken and I was just trying to go, so the exact words escape me. But I got the message. He keeps shouting as I hurriedly walk away.

So, scared of what may come if I return tomorrow night, I called the county non-emergency line and explained what I have here. A police officer calls me, telling me he's heading out that way but that unless the car is clearly inoperable or has expired tags, there's probably nothing he can really do, between local jurisdiction and the local political landscape as it is. I tell him that I understand he may not even talk to the guy, but if he does, if he would ask him what hours would work best/better for him to take my dog out. I'm willing to make this work, within reason. But I wasn't about to do it myself—for one, he parks there when the place is absolutely deserted and there's no street lighting. And I, being a man of 5'4 and as weak as they come, am not going to be able to hold my own; HG wasn't giant, but he looked average height and like he carried just enough weight to be able to throw around without becoming an impediment. I don't really have any friends that would make for good backup, they're all either as small or meek as myself. His dog sounds much smaller than mine, and mine tends to have an initial ""fight"" response that I worry could get her in trouble if this dog comes at us. HG's dog may end up dead or seriously maimed, but either way my dog will end up scarred, either mentally or physically (or both). Not an option; we've made *so* much progress in the year I've had her.

Now, the cop made it sound like they couldn't really do anything unless HG actually makes an advance, assault, or was going out out of his way to harass. And with that, I'm losing hope for being able to enjoy my quiet nights on that little cul-de-sac anymore with my dog. Maybe that's life. Maybe being small and worrying for my dog's safety just means I lose that street to HG. But I thought I would try here and see what I got. 

My questions: **Is there anything I/police can do about HG as things currently stand, is he truly not breaking any laws?** It sounded like intent was pretty clear, and on a definite time scale for whenever he next saw me. **At what point does a threat become strong enough to take legal action?** And, lastly, **are there any local laws that would help me get this guy to go elsewhere?** I'm probably grasping at straws, and ordinarily I wouldn't care if someone sleeps on the street, but when he threatens me and my pup I have to do what I can. In the next few days I will be trying to figure out when he generally arrives, and either accepting the busier street as her nightly poop route or finding a better time to take her out, but I will still be nervous about him showing up or deciding to attack me if he even sees me (I have to cross the intersection to that cul-de-sac to get to the busier street).

I received a notice of garnishment from my employer by mail within the last couple weeks from the payroll dept. It came as a complete surprise since I had no idea that I had been sued. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background...

The lawsuit was from 2011 and is for a substantial amount of money \[for me anyway.\] It was from a credit card company. It comes from debts I couldn't pay in 2008-10 when I had lost my job. I got behind in payments and racked up late fees and when those pushed me over limit, large additional charges as well. Finally, they sent me a bill demanding I pay a large sum covering all of the over limit amount. At that point, I was unable to pay my rent, let alone the debt, so I stopped paying anything. I realized at the time that I should have declared bankruptcy, but that itself was beyond my means and was scrambling to just keep it together. I moved to a friend's place, properly set up mail forwarding to a PO Box \[and then to my current address when I was sure I wasn't going anywhere for a while.\] I am still living at this location, though I am paying rent now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently...

As soon as I received the notice of garnishment, I called the local Legal Aid Society. Since I didn't remember getting served for the suit, they recommended that I go to the court that ruled the default judgement against me and get the proof of service documents from the case.  I retrieved all of the documents from the suit and it appears that I was served fraudulently. The server stated under penalty of perjury that he served me personally. There are some obvious issues with that. First, in the service document I'm described as a white male, 5'8"", 190 lbs, brn hair, brn eyes \[I'm 6'0"" , at the time 220 lbs, brn hair, blue eyes.\] Additionally, he served me at an address that I hadn't lived at for more than 6 months. As for the first part, my driver's license and my actual appearance negate that. For the second part, I have a couple of documents from the DMV, dated from more than 6 months prior to the service, that have my changed/current address. After getting the documents I called back Legal Aid and they said that while it was a case that they would normally help someone like me \[I qualify financially,\] they are not taking any new consumer cases at this time and that there is no end date for this hold. They referred me to a free law clinic put on by a local law school at the public library. I went, documents in hand, a week ago Wednesday. I met with what I assume was a law instructor and student to discuss my case. They asked me if I was willing to fight the garnishment/case and I told them I was. After some discussion, they pointed me to the city law library with the sections of case law and forms I'd need to get started. I went earlier this week. Also, with their recommendation, I filed an exception with the Sheriff's Dept on the garnishment. This no doubt started the ball rolling as far as legal repercussions are concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

Boy, am I out of my wheelhouse... I spent 5 hours at the library, mostly with Ruttger's Guide on Civil Procedure Before Trial, looking up proof of service, stay of garnishment, and motions to set aside judgement. I'll be representing myself in court with the help of the legal clinic. I can return as often as I like to get help with preparing/filing the necessary paperwork.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, my questions...

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I can tell, the best reason to go forward is that I could be held responsible for 8 years of additional interest on the judgement \[time since default judgement was entered.\] Is this true?

&amp;#x200B;

It looks like the first things I should shoot for are getting a stay on the garnishment and make a motion to set aside the judgement. I will do this by claiming that there was extrinsic \[new word for me\] fraud committed to get that default judgement. Presuming I succeed, where does that leave me legally? I'm thinking all I've done is just rolled the clock back to the day before I was served and I'm standing there defending myself against a pending lawsuit. 

&amp;#x200B;

While doing the research I ran across a couple things that might apply to closing out this period of my life and moving beyond this. I read that by CA law, I may be able to ask for a dismissal of the case due to the fact that I wasn't properly served within three years of the start of the suit. The law also says if it succeeds that they will be unable to sue me again for the same reason. \[is that ""with prejudice""?\] Does this apply if the judgement is vacated due to fraudulent service?

 

The other is a Motion of Demurrer \[another brand new word.\] My understanding of that is I'm asking the judge that no matter what the evidence they presented in court, that there is no valid reason for me to be responsible and that I should not have to answer to the lawsuit. He could grant a dismissal based on this motion, with or without prejudice \[I'm not clear here on the difference. With prejudice means they can't sue me again?\] Is fraudulent service enough of a reason to request this motion? I understand that by asking for this I may be admitting to the basis of their lawsuit. How much of a problem could this be?

&amp;#x200B;

As far as the service is concerned, is there better evidence I could provide to the court for proof of address? My description is a given \[and on my DL\], and I do have some minor official DMV paperwork \[interim license issued and an official form dated 6 months before the service with my accurate address.\] I checked into the DMV, but as of March this year they no longer issue 10 year abstracts of driver's records. I have no idea what other reasonably obtainable evidence I can offer. Do you have any suggestions? 

&amp;#x200B;

From my reading/search results I found that even if I prove that the service was fraudulent, most prosecutors will not bother to file criminal charges against the server. Is this true? It kinda sticks in my craw that this is a common thing, so much so that the legal profession has a nickname for it \[""Sewer Service"".\]

&amp;#x200B;

My advisors at the legal clinic also mentioned the possibility of pressing for sanctions/attorney's fees/punitives against the plaintiff. I don't know if it was mentioned to pique my interest in moving forward with this or if it's a common thing to do in these cases. I have to admit that after doing a little reading on the law firm representing the plaintiff that this behavior and negotiating in bad faith may not be an uncommon complaint against them and that I'm very upset with this whole situation. The actual damages in this case seem to be quite low aside from my reputation at work \[I handle cash for them fairly regularly\] and whatever the fraudulent judgement has done to me in general \[which I have no idea of how I would assess.\] Is this something I should consider? Is it even possible for a layman to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

One last thing and I'll let go of your eyeballs \[and thanks so much for hanging in this long.\] I still haven't declared bankruptcy for mostly financial reasons. I have applied for and received credit in the meantime, so don't know if it is even possible at this point. I don't know what is still hanging in my credit record but it looks like all the rest of it has been charged off and sold to collections. Is there any way to get a credit report that goes back more than 7 years?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks again.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may be beyond the scope of this Reddit due to asking for too specific advice, if so I apologize. It&amp;#39;s also very long winded, for that too I apologize in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a notice of garnishment from my employer by mail within the last couple weeks from the payroll dept. It came as a complete surprise since I had no idea that I had been sued. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was from 2011 and is for a substantial amount of money [for me anyway.] It was from a credit card company. It comes from debts I couldn&amp;#39;t pay in 2008-10 when I had lost my job. I got behind in payments and racked up late fees and when those pushed me over limit, large additional charges as well. Finally, they sent me a bill demanding I pay a large sum covering all of the over limit amount. At that point, I was unable to pay my rent, let alone the debt, so I stopped paying anything. I realized at the time that I should have declared bankruptcy, but that itself was beyond my means and was scrambling to just keep it together. I moved to a friend&amp;#39;s place, properly set up mail forwarding to a PO Box [and then to my current address when I was sure I wasn&amp;#39;t going anywhere for a while.] I am still living at this location, though I am paying rent now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently...&lt;/p&gt;

We had a major family discussion in March and she agreed to back off and not touch the finances which is the role of my mother who is executor of the estate. Grandpa has beginning Alzheimer's and does not remember much now. My aunt has been taking him to the bank to make withdrawal's and writing checks of his to her debtors. His mortgage check and utilities check just recently bounced because she drained his account. She buys groceries for him (According to her dietary restrictions) and then takes the food home. My cousin (her kid) just took his debit card to get gas and make her car payment. 

My mom doesn't see what's happening and is VERY nonconfrontational. My dad was originally executor when my grandpa was more coherent but passed suddenly two years ago so we don't have much say in it. 

My question is what legal proceedings can my mom make to stop this leaching of his estate and how can I present this to her so that she understands the legal ramifications of not standing up now? 

When my grandpa was of solid mind, he kept a ledger of the money my aunt borrowed and told her it was coming out of her inheritance. I fear she's may be exceeding her inheritance by now and now draining my mom's estate. My mom is alone since my dad's death and that has taken more wind out of her sails than we can imagine. I am a 10 year Army vet and I am very blunt, so I struggle with staying silent and allowing this. I am also the only stable one in my mom's life, so her burden becomes mine as she ages. My sister is barely hanging on to adulthood.

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather had a major heart event about 1 yr ago. He and my mom share a 12 acre property with 2 homes. They have been co-owner&amp;#39;s for almost 20 years. My fairly deadbeat but well meaning Aunt started helping out by staying at his home M-F and taking care of him and medical appointments. My mom works full time. My sister and I would also take shifts caring for grandpa and my mom had weekends.

Over the noise of the tv I heard a woman screaming “help me!” “Please help me!”.
I ran outside and about a block down the street. A very large man was trying to drag a woman into a house, he even picked her up and threw her against the door.

I yelled “hey asshole, I’ve already called the cops”, trying to distract him, and then dialed 911. This is a busy and upscale neighbourhood. And yet I was the only person outside of their home. The only one to come running and to try to stop/witness this event. The police came, arrested the man and interviewed me.

Anyway fast forward to two months ago I received a subpoena to testify as the sole witness in a criminal trial about this.
The man is charged with Unlawful Restraint, and Attempted Kidnapping.
The subpoena said I had to show up every day for a week, and if I didn’t they would put out a bench warrant for my arrest.
I did so, and on the third day of nothing happening I was told the trial had been pushed back.

Now, today I have received another subpoena saying that I have to show up against the new trial date a month and a half from now (or face arrest), but the dates given to me coincide with a trip I’m taking to Ireland (I live in Texas). I’ve already bought the airfare, and booked the hotels. I want to see this guy have his day in court, it was horrendous looking what I had run into that night. But obviously I also want to go on my trip and not lose a lot of money.

I've worked at this franchise restaurant for about 3 years now, and my effective pay rate was cut without notice. 

When I first noticed my paycheck was only about 2/3's what it had been, I asked the franchise owner (who does payroll and mostly decides wages) why it was so low, to which he responded there was a garnishment order from the Dept of Revenue. I tried to find who the garnishment was on behalf of to no avail, and so assumed there was nothing I could do to stop such a garnishment other than just accept it until it's paid off, so that was the end of it. 

It's almost a year and a half later now, but my paychecks have been fluctuating, generally getting smaller and smaller. I used to look at every check stub I got, but everything was always in order so I stopped eventually, around the time he switched to an online payroll processor, which requires a lengthy process of registering an account to see stuff like pay stubs. My bills have been really tight lately, so I finally went through the registration process to see how much left of the garnishment was remaining. The garnishment is almost paid off which is good, but I noticed there were two rows of job roles--two different hourly rates that I was getting paid, with my hours fluctuating between the two (the hourly rate he and I agreed on, and one 67% of that), presumably depending on how generous the owner was feeling that week. I went through all the pay stubs and calculated I was shorted around $7000 in total.

As far as I'm aware, employers in Wisconsin can't cut your pay rate without notifying you. What's my best course of action? It appears Wisconsin allows workers to file a Wage Claim with the Dept of Workforce Development (2 year statute of limitation), and employers can't take action against them if they do? I'm unsure because I've been told to lock in a second job before doing any of this, as I can expect to be let go as soon as I do. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Tl;dr My boss cut my hourly pay by about 1/3 without telling me, when I asked about it, he blamed it on a garnishment order (which I did have, but not that much). Just found out what's been happening a year and half/$7k later, wondering if I'm legally entitled to that money.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Wisconsin]&lt;/p&gt;

It appears Wisconsin allows workers to file a Wage Claim with the Dept of Workforce Development (2 year statute of limitation), and employers can&amp;#39;t take action against them if they do? I&amp;#39;m unsure because I&amp;#39;ve been told to lock in a second job before doing any of this, as I can expect to be let go as soon as I do. Any advice is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr My boss cut my hourly pay by about 1/3 without telling me, when I asked about it, he blamed it on a garnishment order (which I did have, but not that much). Just found out what&amp;#39;s been happening a year and half/$7k later, wondering if I&amp;#39;m legally entitled to that money.&lt;/p&gt;

His bloodwork is [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/qoX1F8L) The vet assured us that it was okay cause she gave him a vitamin K shot to help the blood clot and sent us with pills of that and antibiotics.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a falling out with my old roommate (who I thought was a good friend) over cleaning fees that were charged to his security deposit. I never signed on to the lease and the bill is in his name (I never signed any kind of contract). Originally I had verbally agreed to pay for my part of a carpet cleaning (about $50) but the final cleaning fees amounted to $150. The kicker is he is charging me another $20 for ""time and inconvenience"" for forgetting a few items in the storage room. Originally I was going to pay the $50 I said I would but that ""fee"" frustrated me. I told him off by text saying I wouldn't pay him and now he's threatening to take me to small claims if I don't pay up by Aug. 4th (I'm in BC, Canada). 

Does he have a case? I assume not, since I never signed anything. Should I pay the $170 he's asking for, pay the $50 I said I would, or still not pay? Any and all advice would be appreciated since this is my first potential brush with the legal system. Thanks!

He has zero criminal history. The detective said he was baffled by the case because he doesn't seem like someone who would do something like this.

Aside from some cleaning and possibly some floor damage, i wasn't too concerned from a property damage standpoint. I can clean and fix the floor myself pretty quickly, however there was a significant amount of property left in the shed (approximately 13x13), and some on the interior.

The entire floor of the shed is covered in 2-3 feet of junk. Additionally there are lots of things left in the lawn. An old box spring, an old couch that is in pieces, some random old tires, lumber, table, tarps, furniture. inside there are some random pictures left up, some small kitchen appliances, food.

I'm familiar enough with what needs to be done with the property left behind but what i really want to know is how do i go about proving the property is un-rentable and charging rent until they get their stuff? Can i even charge that against the security deposit? I contacted them immediately on July 2nd and though they acknowledge the stuff, they won't give me a firm day that it will be removed.

What should i do from a legal standpoint? This is not a high-rent area, so spending money on lawyer fees is not really an option but I always have lots of interest in the property and it is not hard to rent again, i just need it rentable.

Within the contact, there was a clean up section where it stated: 

""You agree to clean the cottage prior to departure, remove your own garbage and recycling, and generally to leave the property in the same state of cleanliness and general order in which it was found.

Prior to leaving, we cleaned the cottage to restore it to the condition it was in when we arrived (I took pictures of the place when we arrived and after the cleanup as proof it was in the same state of cleanliness), however, we left behind about 10 bags of garbage as all the dumps in the area were closed. We understood the contract to be a $30 charge for all of the garbage, however the landlord is trying to say it is a $30 charge per bag, and is not returning us our deposit.

I think he's annoyed that there were so many bags and so is trying to recuperate as much money as he can. but the contract doesn't state that the charge is $30/bag.

After her talking back and forth with her mother and her mother to the landlord, the landlord said that they were shouting for us in the house, which I doubt because my roommate and I were both awake in our rooms. My roommate also had dogs one being a German Shepherd which would've notified her if it even heard anything from outside the home. Nobody knocked on our bedroom doors either which was strange. After their discussion my roommate asked the landlord to come over again and discuss the unit, but no-one had notified me that they would becoming again. I had nothing to hide anyway, but would like to know if anyone was coming into my home. This time when the landlord came they said ""Oh didn't know you where here,"" to me presuming I was not home or I had not moved back in? (I moved out of the unit between Sept-Feb, but still had my lease and moved back in for a month already and notified the office and got my keys back). For some reason they seemed nervous because they weren't expecting me to be there. They talked to both of us about our unit then left. 

I read that in the state of Alabama it is illegal for the landlord to enter a tenants unit without a 24hr notice. With all this being said, would I be able to sue them, terminate my lease (due to many other reasons of living here) or get any kind of compensation? My worries are that it was a few months back and I did not record them coming into our home or anything, but I also did not receive any email or phone call from them. My roommate and her mother would be a witness to it.

Second thing is my rent is about $160 higher this month. When I checked my utility bills that's through the apartment complex, the sewage and water was 4x higher and the electric has more than doubled. They listed it as 'final utility'. It was unusual to me because I moved out in May and my roommate moved out around mid-late June, so I don't see a reason as to why it's so high. We don't have anybody subleasing our unit and I brought this up with management, but have yet to hear anything back from them. It's already the 5th which is when late fees start to apply. From other experiences in the past with them I feel like they're waiting to reply after the 5th so they can get extra money from the late fees, but I can't say for sure.

This time when the landlord came they said &amp;quot;Oh didn&amp;#39;t know you where here,&amp;quot; to me presuming I was not home or I had not moved back in? (I moved out of the unit between Sept-Feb, but still had my lease and moved back in for a month already and notified the office and got my keys back). For some reason they seemed nervous because they weren&amp;#39;t expecting me to be there. They talked to both of us about our unit then left. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read that in the state of Alabama it is illegal for the landlord to enter a tenants unit without a 24hr notice. With all this being said, would I be able to sue them, terminate my lease (due to many other reasons of living here) or get any kind of compensation? My worries are that it was a few months back and I did not record them coming into our home or anything, but I also did not receive any email or phone call from them. My roommate and her mother would be a witness to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second thing is my rent is about $160 higher this month. When I checked my utility bills that&amp;#39;s through the apartment complex, the sewage and water was 4x higher and the electric has more than doubled. They listed it as &amp;#39;final utility&amp;#39;. It was unusual to me because I moved out in May and my roommate moved out around mid-late June, so I don&amp;#39;t see a reason as to why it&amp;#39;s so high. We don&amp;#39;t have anybody subleasing our unit and I brought this up with management, but have yet to hear anything back from them. It&amp;#39;s already the 5th which is when late fees start to apply. From other experiences in the past with them I feel like they&amp;#39;re waiting to reply after the 5th so they can get extra money from the late fees, but I can&amp;#39;t say for sure. My question is if I can prove this would I be able to take the late fees off?&lt;/p&gt;

Hello,

I have been performing work for a small business owner (owner, and 2 part time people through 1099.) The company is an LLC, let's call it Company A. As the companies revenue is less than $1,000,000/year, the owner only provides an hourly rate to employees through 1099s with no benefits (they have other jobs so it's just extra money.)

For the past couple months, I have been optimizing the Company A by starting an online store and marketing, which has greatly increased revenue. The owner wants to hire me full time, but I definitely need benefits, which he doesn't want to provide (and I am fine with that) and we both would have to pay taxes (I think.)

The owner and I agree that a salary of $110,000/yr is acceptable, and an allowance of $10,000/yr for medical, dental, and vision insurance. What I am thinking is that I start my own company, and charge Company A a service charge of $60/hr rather than a salary being paid to me from the company.

What kind of company do I start to accomplish this? Is this the best way of going about this?

Is the service charge that I charge Company A tax deductible for company A (in that it is COGS?) Is my insurance tax deductible for my own company?

Thank you for your help in advanced!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greendale, WI USA&lt;/p&gt;

We rent out a 2 bedroom/1 living room unit attached to our house ~$1500/month to a guy in his 30's. He paid his first couple of months of rent just fine, then he started telling us that he'll ""have it ready by the next month"" more and more.... until we somehow ended at this point. 

The problem is that we've already tried to give him the eviction notice where he must pay the rent in whole last year, and he has only paid a fraction of the total amount since then. Obviously, we haven't evicted him, since my family wants his money first. The agreement we signed a year ago was the 10 Day Notice for Unpaid Rent or Utilities form found on the BC government website - however just signing this form and keeping a copy each feels so useless. 

His excuse on why he hasn't paid rent is that his money is tied in China because of some law/restriction on his finances from being transferred to foreign countries. We're thinking this is a scam, and someday he's just going to move out without paying a single penny. For example, I was supposed to receive the cash today, but he says his lawyer gave him a cheque so therefore he will get us the cash next Tuesday. I'll be visiting the office with him next Tuesday (supposedly), but this won't be the first time he ""delays"" the appointment due to some issue. 


What can we legally do to ensure that we can somehow obtain the rent he owes us in whole? Is there a way to make sure that at least some of his assets can be tied to us?

I work in Southern California for a company that has set up operations here, but is headquartered in London, GB.  I am a salaried employee who is to be paid every 2 weeks.  On 6/21 I was not paid.  I escalated this to my boss and our HR individual.  For 2 weeks I was told it was a glitch in the payroll system they are trying to figure out, and should have fixed ""soon"".  I woke up this morning (another pay day) and now have not been paid for 2 pay periods.

What is my course of action here?  Am I due additional pay?

Oh and to make things a little hairier, my wife is pregnant and I need the PTO I have for leave in November, so I am in a tough spot - can't just quit right now.

Fortunately I have money saved to hold me over, but this is causing unnecessary stress.  Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: Also to make things even a little more dicey, I am also hesitant to quit as I was recently promoted (a great title that will really boost my resume).

So I’m not posting this for me necessarily. It is, however, impacting me. also, if the flair is wrong, I’ll fix it. It’s my first post here and this is a tight spot.

About half a year ago my parents took over a business with a majority of ownership halfway through a pay period. It’s a small business, and the pay period is monthly. The business they bought this from is still running but moved locations. They were primarily responsible for that pay period.

Due to a mistake, a paycheck for one employee, who we will name M, went to another employee, K. K did not notice the mistake. My parents did not confront the other business for the mistake but instead used their own funds to properly pay M and told K about what happened and that they’d “resolve the matter soon”. They never took the money back from K. Half a year later, my parents have remembered the incident and decided to resolve it.

What this means is they approached K and said K needs to pay them back through their next check. Essentially, K would not get a check this month. The reason this concerns me is I have a leadership roll in running and managing their business as well as communicating with the employees, and K has come to me in hysterics. Simultaneously, my parents are in hysterics. What I told my parents is that they, at this point, should let it go since they did not attempt to fix the mistake when it happened. They did not like my answer. K already put in her two weeks notice before this happened, so she would have no last pay-check, but she insists this will impact her finances severely. So, she says she will press legal action if this passes. 

Parents insist K lose her check this month or they’ll fire her and not let her work her last two weeks, and are incredibly dead set on this, and told me they believe she intentionally stole from a small business by not returning the money when it happened and refusing to return it now. K is also dead set on doing whatever she can to, in her words, ‘hand it’ to my parents. I’m worried this will land in a crash and burn of the business, and screw over an employee. 

I want to know if my parents have a legal ground or a case to stand on, and if K does too. Thank you very much.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm a college student, I work full time and I rent a house with four other people and a dog. This is the first time I've really rented a place. I have a year to year to lease which is up at the end of the month. Originally I had told her that I planned on staying but after everything happening. I don’t know that I plan to. Each of us lease our own room and the landlady does not live on premises.

Two years ago, when I first signed on to rent a room from my landlady, she didn't give me a copy of tenants rights and I’m pretty sure she didn’t give anyone else their. I didn't know that was required until recently. She disclosed that there were mold but said something to the effect of all old houses have mold but I learned recently that she didn’t disclose that there was mold to one of my other roommates. She was a hoarder and when we moved in an entire room and the garage was full of just clutter. We moved in and there were mice, and she gave us mouse traps but never had any pest company take care of the situation. She would constantly show up without 24 hour notice to collect rent, which is documented through text, but we wouldn't say anything because rent was really cheap and I thought that if I said anything she could raise my rent, I didn't know that retaliation was illegal. She would also take forever to fix things that we asked for and if it did get fixed, it would get half ass get fixed or not taken care of. For instance it says on my lease two years ago that a window was going to be fixed, to this day it has not been fixed. Again, didn't say anything because I didn't want my rent to get raised. Recently, with 8 hours notice she told us, didn't ask, that the next day she was going to have her friends live in our den for a couple of days. It didn't end up happening but that's what set me off and got me reading up on laws.

&amp;#x200B;

So there's two major issues, the repairs that haven't happened and her violating the 24 hour notice.

As of right now, there is mold on the house because the sprinklers in the front yard are leaking. I asked for that to be fixed, over text, first in August, and then again at the end of May. There are still leaking today and now, there is mold growing on the side of the house and a puddle of standing water and there has been for months.

There is carpet that was supposed to get renovated and had the top layer removed around the beginning of June and has been left until now, with nails sticking up out of the ground.

There was raccoon sight at night and the a skunk sightings the next morning by one of my roommates a week before the end of June and when we asked for pest control, again over text, to be called was disregarded, we followed up and our concerns were not addressed.

The grouting in the kitchen sink is gone but when we mentioned it she 'fixed' it by getting us a new sink head and ignored the grouting.

That's not to mention there is cracks in the bathroom grouting, there is a house dug in the side of the house large enough that my roommates dog got stuck in and other issues. These issues were not brought up in a way that was documented, until recently, but they existed pretty much since we moved it.

Additionally, I knew that 24 hour notice was required and I stated, over text, that I wanted 24 hours notice for anyone to be on the property, as is required by law after the situation with her friend. I mentioned that I have generalized anxiety and that this situation is making it worse. When we asked for the carpet to get fixed she sent over her handyman who has a key to our house without any notice, this is frequent behavior of hers. I know her son has a key to the house and I'm pretty sure other people do as well. I called her out and asked for at least an hour notice if he couldn't give us 24 hours and she tried to brush it off but I said that I require an hour notice. Today he showed up without any notice and entered our house. I wasn't home or I would have called the cops. I texted her and she acknowledged that she asked him to come to the house.

&amp;#x200B;

We were told by the fair housing committee that we have to document everything that hasn't been fixed and give her 30 days to fix things but I think we have enough of a case right now. Has anyone been in something similar to this, I'm at a bit of a loss as to what steps to take. I'm going to try and find an attorney next but I'm not sure how to do that, what to expect in terms of how that works and how pricing works. Can someone recommend me resources on that or anything pertaining to this situation?

Also, does anyone know if me mentioning that I have anxiety places me under ADA and asking for specific accommodations and then having that ignored violates the Fair Housing Act or were there more steps that I needed to take in that situation?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location: Orange County, CA&lt;/p&gt;

I know her son has a key to the house and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure other people do as well. I called her out and asked for at least an hour notice if he couldn&amp;#39;t give us 24 hours and she tried to brush it off but I said that I require an hour notice. Today he showed up without any notice and entered our house. I wasn&amp;#39;t home or I would have called the cops. I texted her and she acknowledged that she asked him to come to the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were told by the fair housing committee that we have to document everything that hasn&amp;#39;t been fixed and give her 30 days to fix things but I think we have enough of a case right now. Has anyone been in something similar to this, I&amp;#39;m at a bit of a loss as to what steps to take. I&amp;#39;m going to try and find an attorney next but I&amp;#39;m not sure how to do that, what to expect in terms of how that works and how pricing works. Can someone recommend me resources on that or anything pertaining to this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, does anyone know if me mentioning that I have anxiety places me under ADA and asking for specific accommodations and then having that ignored violates the Fair Housing Act or were there more steps that I needed to take in that situation?&lt;/p&gt;

This story is quite long but I'll cut the fluff and state the details.

Basic info:

* We have a furniture store on Etsy
* We've been on Etsy for less than a year 
* This is our first time dealing with buyer claims on Etsy
* We offer white glove delivery service (i.e. delivery guys pick up the items, drive it to the customer, unwraps it, then places it into their house, takes a picture upon completion, and obtains a signature from the buyer)
* We've been selling and shipping stuff for nearly 20 years (through many other online platforms)
* Location: California

Situation per our understanding (Seller): 

* Customer purchased two items (large pieces of furniture)
* Delivery guys picked up the items from our business (we took a picture before they loaded it into their car to indicate well wrapped and no damage)
* We obtained a signed bill of lading from the delivery guys


Situation per our Delivery guys

* Delivery guys drove to customer residence and set it on sidewalk 
* Delivery guys asked the customer to sign the paperwork but delivery guys was not able to obtain the signature (exact reasons unknown).
* Delivery guys claimed the customer assaulted them
* Delivery guys claimed the customer was very verbal (i.e. shouted expletives) and told them to leave his property (sidewalk)

Situation per the Customer

* Customer claimed delivery guys had a sharp object (e.g., knife) when trying to unwrap package for customer
* Customer claimed there was damage on one of the pieces and sent us picture of the damage (item was not damaged before it was loaded onto the delivery van)
* Customer never signed the package, but surveillance video shared by the customer shows that the customer moving the items into his home
* Customer opened a Case on Etsy claiming Non-delivery and asking for full refund or discount price on items due to damage and assault by the shipper

This is the first time something this outrageous has happened to me and I'm at a loss how to respond. I've reviewed Etsy's [policies!](https://www.etsy.com/legal/policy/cases-for-sellers/242641420379?ref=list) and it seems that we (the Seller) are in the clear if we show proof of ""a scanned copy of the delivery confirmation or departure information"" or ""a shipping service receipt."" 

We're looking for some advice on how to best handle this situation, especially when we are not present during delivery.

(And creepily named all our family by full name.) I went back and forth with him a bit, and he told me “good luck with ‘legal repercussions,’ meanwhile I’ll be fucking up your life.” He’s not even extorting anything out of us he just threatens us seemingly for pure intimidation. 

The bizarre aspect of this is that he bluffs the whole time. He told me to check my aunts Facebook wall and nothing was there. He said he was talking to my friends boyfriend and that wasn’t true. He also once sent me a photo from my friends computer app Photobooth that we never posted which gives me the sinking weird feeling he has some sort of access to her laptop.

I normally recieve a notice beforehand and pay from there as I have memory problems. Why would this be an arrest warrant not a bench warrant and what is my next step?&lt;/p&gt;

However, I do not have a good relationship with his girlfriend, and am worried she has access to his banking and may steal money or close accounts.  She would be able to do so if I gave her my father's cellphone as she has already requested.

My father specifically requested that I access his account and transfer savings to my account.  I wouldn't feel rushed to do so as I haven't yet declared myself as executor and done the paperwork etc.  But, with this pressing issue, I'm worried.  Is it illegal to transfer money out of his account at this stage (before I am officially executor)?  What should I do about his bank accounts so she doesn't have access?

Well, we had a realtor do a market analysis and an appraiser do an appraisal.  Well the Realtor's analysis was 120k less than the Appraiser's. 

My Uncle is out of town so he won't be able to speak to the lawyer for a while. That's why I'm asking here.

Does anyone know the guidelines for meeting the requirements in case Medicare audits my Grandma if she needs to move to that in the future? Will the Market Analysis by the Realtor work

I live in Orange County, California.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface, my dog is a 65-70 pound Siberian Husky with a heart of gold and would never hurt a fly. This incident does not involve my dog hurting anybody.

&amp;#x200B;

My dog had a grooming appointment today at a well-known dog grooming company. This is the place I have taken him to a few times before, but this time was a nightmare. My girlfriend dropped him off for his appointment and picked him up, and I am only telling the story that she told me up until the point that she got home with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

When she arrived, the groomer mentioned that my dog had some ""abrasions"" from brushing him and the groomer recommended that he go see a vet. The groomer also told my girlfriend the following: ""I guess nobody uses that brush anymore, but nobody told me not to use it"" - or some version thereof. Those words WERE spoken, but maybe not with that exact vocabulary. My girlfriend, without much experience in these types of situations just went along with the groomer's suggestion since she noticed some skin ""irritation"" where the groomer was referring to. My girlfriend tried to schedule an appointment for him today, but couldn't get one until tomorrow morning. My girlfriend did not get ANY paperwork regarding the incident or even that my dog had seen the groomer. My girlfriend didn't notice the extent of the irritation until we both looked when she got home. The trip home was likely enough time for it to be very, very visible in proper lighting. Keep in mind, this is a thick-coated dog.

&amp;#x200B;

When she brought him home, I could immediately see that his back end (hip area down to his back legs) was pink. Through his fur. Upon further investigation, my dog's skin had been brushed RAW. To the point of actual bleeding in some areas where blood had already begun to clot. We searched as best as we could as my poor boy was flinching from every touch. He would flinch if we even went to touch the area. I have attached pictures (warning, mildly graphic).

&amp;#x200B;

I'll shed some light on why this is INSANE to me. My dog is a total softy. He loves everything and everybody and will whimper at the slightest pinch of pain. As a husky owner, I brush my dog. I don't brush him all the time, but I brush him. I had intentionally not brushed him for quite some time so his coat would clump to make it easier to remove his winter fur. If I ever brush my dog with too much pressure or force, he will let me know by GENTLY sticking his mouth on my hand or turning to look at me and whimper. For this to have gone so far as to draw blood must have been unbelievably negligent. 

&amp;#x200B;

After examining my dog, I drove back to the groomer (myself and my girlfriend this time) and tried to speak with somebody, but they had all gone home. The only person we spoke with was a manager that did not oversee the grooming area. However, the manager WAS aware about what happened to a dog at the groomer and she quickly learned that it was mine. The manager was extremely apologetic and gave us free dog aspirin and a type of antibacterial spray. Since the aspirin, my dog has been whimpering less but hasn't really stopped his subtle whine since he got home. He is going to his vet appointment and I will be going into the groomer tomorrow to get all of the paperwork and information I can get out of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

From there, I don't know what more to do. I feel so bad that my dog had to go through literal torture without me being there to save him. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm not sure whether I should seek legal action or not, or whether it's even warranted. I just want to be sure that this doesn't happen to another dog since I can't go back and prevent it from happening to my own. The groomer has already offered to compensate us for any veterinary bills or expenses incurred from his injury, but we have yet to see anything in writing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the two best pictures I could get. He was too squirmy. \[Warning, possibly graphic\] but it's more of a cringe factor.

I lived in NYC for nearly 10 years, and bought my car there. I moved to Colorado in 2015 and have been here since then. Late last year, my wife and I rented a house back in our old neighborhood (Greenpoint) and stayed there for a couple of weeks over Christmas. We drove back, because we wanted to bring our dogs. Was a fun time, and we drove home to Colorado.

Fast forward to today, and I get a mail from a collection agency saying I owe $400 for tickets issued during the time we were back in Brooklyn. This is literally the first time I’ve heard of it, we didn’t get any kind of ticket on our car while we were there. 

The 3 violations are for out of date inspection and registration stickers, and registration sticker not matching the plates. I’d never bothered to remove the registration and inspection stickers from 2015 and had left them in the window, but our car has been Colorado registered with Colorado plates since 2016. This isn’t a shady registration thing...we 100% live in Colorado, Colorado licenses, tax returns etc. We go back to New York maybe once or twice a year. The violations are issued against our old NY license plate, which I returned in early 2016.

I’m not sure how to proceed. It seems very obvious that this is bullshit, but I’m trying to figure out if this is even worth fighting. Usually I’d be aggressive about this, but I’m concerned that it’s already gone to collections, and I don’t want my credit fucked over it.

Does anyone know if I have case here? I guess they’ll argue that I should have removed the stickers, and I’m sure they say that seeing as it’s been over 6 months that it’s too late to appeal, but I really don’t want to pay $400 over such a trivial issue, particularly when my ‘crime’ was leaving an old sticker on a car.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the two years the chain has expanded exponentially, and the management has grown to be incredibly toxic. Every single move scrutinized, write-ups passed out for things as simple as sitting down (after the shop was scrubbed spotless, and we hadn't had a customer in hours). I was promoted to management, worked near to death and was regularly asked to work without pay in order to get all my duties done without going in to overtime, all the while they increased my duties on a monthly basis. I asked for an assistant manager, and was denied several times. Eventually I hit my breaking point and applied to a different shop in the same industry, as it is something I am very good at, and at only $11/hr I was not willing to continue working myself to death. Finding another job in the industry that wasn't within 50 miles of another location is near impossible, as they are in every major city and moving isn't an option for me (I am a military spouse tied to a base).

&amp;#x200B;

My former employer found out I accepted a position at another shop, called me and cursed at me for a solid 5 minutes straight before firing me. Verbal abuse from the owners and upper management was common, and a major factor in to why I chose to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

I began work at a new shop today, to find out that the owner has been repeatedly entering the business and demanding to know if I work there, threatening to sue them and me for ""breech of contract"" and breaking my non-compete. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did sign an NDA as well and fully intend to keep that, there was not much that currently applies to the current job beyond business numbers, which is not any of my current employer's business anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Does their non-disclosure stand? If it does, what do I face in court? Will the courts make me quit my job and pay fees? I'm just a retail worker, I have no experience with legal matters and googling did not help me much.

I am subletting my room in NYC from  a woman who was on the lease since November 2017z It came to my attention that she wasn’t here legally. Normally I really don’t care but this woman is very bipolar and has been harassing me on and off. First it was about talkinng to her boy toy who was also our other roommate, then random things like not reaching her level of cleanliness, leaving out a grocery bag etc etc. She would threaten to evict me. I was unable to move out because I am poor. 

Anyway recently, things got really bad and we had a verbal argument. She was running Airbnb and overcharging us rent. I spoke to the landlord and reduced my rent. However, at the end of last month she claimed that she “left the country” but I know for sure she is still in the city. 

Even though she has moved out and is not renewing her lease at the end of July nor is she coming back, she continues to act like she owns the apartment. She tried to Airbnb (even though she is not in the country) I shut that down because I was uncomfortable with her guests in the house and no one to take responsibility. She constantly tries to keep tabs on me through other roommates and get random people into the apartment. I’ve spoken to the landlord but he thinks that since she is the lease holder, she still has the right to the apartment. 

My question is if she has voluntarily moved out and sent us a notice saying she won’t be coming back, what is her claim on the apartment especially if she claims to be out of the country?

For context, we've been married for a few years. She had an affair with a friend of mine a little under a year ago. I discovered by accident, tried to forgive her (stupidly), we went through loads of therapy and growth, and it really seemed like things could work again (still stupid).

Then a few months ago, again on accident, I discover that she just never stopped sleeping around, and is in the middle of an affair now. I move out while's she's gone for a weekend. I open a new bank account and move half our money to it.

My plan was to seek a Divorce With Agreement. I want to avoid court and trouble, so I resolve to put away my anger, be amicable, and try to negotiate a favorable agreement. We're both broke and busy so court isn't a great option.

No kids, no house. The major points of contention are:

- A car, in her name only (bought a few months before the wedding), worth ~$7,000 that ~$3,000 is still owed on. 

- An hard apartment lease which we're both stuck on for around a year.

**My goals are to end up with the car, and for her to take over the apartment completely - all rent, responsibility, and finding a roommate.** I don't need the car immediately and can wait for her to graduate and move (she's still in school) in 6 months to take ownership.

At first, she verbally agrees to everything. She'll take over the apartment, we can share the car and she'll give me the car when she graduates and moves. She even offered to do the divorce paperwork. We have an honest conversation about the relationship ending. She feels guilty, apologized for hurting me in her ""process of self-discovery"" and wanted to give me an fair easy divorce. She even wants to stay friends. At the time it seemed like I'd get what I was looking for.

Now things are slowly getting hostile. A month has gone by and I'm not able to get any of her agreements in writing - she's ""too busy"". I'm getting impatient and worried she'll change her mind. She let the car's plates expire and didn't renew them for weeks, leaving me unable to legally use it, and got pissed at me when I asked her to please renew them.

The worst part is she's now threatened to publicly accuse me of sexual abuse, if I'm difficult about anything to do with the divorce. She's threatened this multiple times in private, and keeps making veiled threats - ""don't give me reason to be difficult with you"", ""I don't want to fuck you over, don't make me want to"" - any time I get impatient or critical about her. I know what her allegations are thanks to it coming up during couples therapy, and I can definitely discuss the details elsewhere (maybe on AITA). The short answer is I didn't abuse her, but she's convinced herself that what happened between us ""counts"" as abuse.

A few days ago we met to go over agreements. I finally get her to sign a (hindsight bad) contract about the car - we share usage and payments equally for 6 months, then she gives the car to me. But she refused to sign any agreements about the apartment yet. She said she's considering making me pay for the apartment anyway, and threatened me further. Finally, as she's leaving, she reveals she got intimate with another one of my close friends a few months back. Then she leaves to immediately renew the car's registration and bill me for it.

I'm done. No more goodwill, I definitely can't trust her and never should have thought I could. She could tell me the grass is green now and I'd doubt it. There's no way the car contract we signed can work, and I'm not sure a Divorce With Agreement will work either. ***I just want to meet the above goals, and get this bitch out of my life as quickly and completely as possible.***

1. What are the realities of going straight to divorce court in Indiana? I'm absolutely broke, can I self represent? I have a lot of time and currently work a very low effort minimum wage help desk job.

2. Regarding the fake sexual abuse threats, what can I do to protect myself against them legally? Should I file a police report?

3. Should I use ""taking her to court"" as an ultimatum to get her to proceed with the Divorce With Agreement as we originally agreed? She does NOT want to go to court, the added stress will likely derail her graduation timeline. Can she block a Divorce With Agreement from completing after documents have been submitted?

4. If we go to court, what's the likelihood I meet my goals regarding the apartment and car? Indiana's no fault. But she kept the cat, the apartment, the bed, most of our furniture and kitchen supplies, she's the one who cheated and I have proof, I'm the one who moved out, I need the car just as much - will any of that help my case? My #1 priority is getting out of the lease, I can worst-case-scenario handle not getting the car.

5. The car contract we just signed is a huge problem, and has a major loophole due to it being built on trust. I'd like to exploit that before she does, to convince her to break / revise the contract. Is it legally a good idea to do that that? The exploit does not break any of the terms of the contract.

Edit: AZ, USA

2nd edit: The policy was issued in CA through Covered California. I was in AZ visiting family. I can provide the insurance provider and hospital if necessary.

3rd edit: Per my ins company, the only way I can self-file is via reimbursement. Can't afford that route.

&amp;#x200B;

I was taken to the ER somewhat recently and it was determined I would need to be admitted for observation for the night. It took a couple months to receive a bill, and when I did so, I provided my insurance information. I was unable to provide it at the time of the incident because I wasn't exactly coherent, and I didn't have my insurance card on me because I was covered by a new policy and hadn't received it yet.

&amp;#x200B;

A month later I receive another bill with an 'uninsured' discount. I place a call to the hospital's customer service number and was told by a rep that my insurance was indeed billed and the claim was *denied* due to not being under contract with my insurance company. It didn't make sense so I filed an appeal with my insurance company with the little info I had. There was no record of a claim being submitted to them at the time but I didn't really understand the process.  Another few weeks later I receive a letter from my insurance company basically telling me that a claim was never submitted and they have no idea what I'm talking about.

&amp;#x200B;

I once again call the customer service line for the hospital, and was told by a supervisor that they're **not obligated to file a claim with the insurance company because they're not under contract with the provider.** I was provided with incorrect information during the first call.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm stuck with an almost 30k hospital bill when I've been paying a decent chunk of money for health insurance that essentially appears to be worthless. I've had to agree to a payment plan I cannot afford in order to keep the bill from going to collections. No idea how to proceed. Anybody have any advice as to what to do here?

My friend’s ex-employer is trying to claim he doesn’t have the money to pay her what she’s owed, and I’m trying to get input on what legal ground she may potentially have to stand on and what she can say to motivate him to “find” the money to pay her.

She recently worked for this guy for one month salaried at 60k (officially, not under the table) but received no payment.  He is claiming that he “doesn’t have the money” because a bunch of money had apparently been stolen by a previous employee.

It’s been three weeks since she quit and still no payment.  At this point could she like sue him or something for more than what she’s owed since obviously this is super illegal?  Also what other details would need to be known for this to be effective?  Is there any kind of course of action y’all could think to even threaten that would make him not want to deal with it and just pay?

I found a better deal and trying to back out of the Apartment A's agreement. The treatment I got was the same old scare tactic in paying for a one time penalty $3500 (which does not include in the agreement, or any section dedicated to termination of contract) or sue the crap out of me. 

HOWEVER, 
there is a catch to this situation! I happened to found out that there are sections on the agreement that I  forgot to sign, for instance, Pets and Mold growth prevention. 

My questions are: 

+ Based on the brief description of the case, If there is no section stating about early termination, would the $3500 fee asked is shady or flat out illegal? 

+ Given that my lease agreement is not fully signed by me, would the lease agreement be in effective? If that makes sense.

Using a throwaway account. 

My cousin is a kleptomaniac and cannot help herself stealing whenever we enter stores. Today she stole around $400 worth of merchandise by taking a ton of clothing into the dressing room and then stuffing half of the clothes into her other shopping bags. I did not take anything but I went into the dressing room with her when she was hiding the clothes in her bags to try to convince her not to steal. But she didn’t listen to me and there was nothing I could do without causing a huge scene so I just sat there in the dressing room watching her hide all the clothing (I feel like an idiot for not doing more to stop her). 

I decided to purchase a shirt at the store because I felt bad and used my debit card to do so. On our way out, the alarm towers went off so the clerks wanted to run our bags over their sensors to make sure there was nothing in our bags. I handed over all of my bags and the sensors did not go off. My cousins bags also did not go off (miraculously). Neither of our bags were searched or opened. However, when we tried to walk through the towers, the alarm went off again but the clerks let us go but looked very suspicious. Also, according to my cousin, there were definitely security cameras in the store. 

My cousin got extremely scared and demanded that we leave. We came in my car, so I now I am worried that the store will use my license plate or debit card information to penalize me for her thefts. I am absolutely furious at my deadbeat cousin for putting me in that situation. What are the odds that the store or police will target me if I did not steal anything? If we were allowed to walk out of the store, does that mean she did not get caught? Would I be penalized for technically being an accomplice? 

Any information about what type of legal consequences I can expect for using my debit card and car to drive there would be greatly appreciated. I also understand that my involvement in my cousins shoplifting was definitely wrong and I know I should have done more to stop her or known better than to go into a clothing store with her.

So I live in an apartment and when I first moved in everything seemed perfectly fine. There was a strange odor but very mild and I thought it was just the new house smell. As time passed by it started to get worse, still mild, and I thought it was maybe just my odor? Months later it started to smell profuse and contacted management on June 20th. They sent someone over July 1st and they told me that a dead rodent/animal was rotting in the wall where the electric/breaker box is and that he couldn't move it because of all the wires (which probably tangled and suffocated the rodent). He explained that the wall would probably have to be broken open to extract the animal and clean the mess.

&amp;#x200B;

After hearing this I contacted management after he explained the situation and they didn't get back to me. I contacted them again on July 5th and they promised a call back within an hour (when their maintenance team was back). As you probably guessed, still no call and at this point, I am quite fed up.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Throughout this time, especially in late June, I have been actively calling, emailing, going to the apartment office, submitting a maintenance request on their main website but all I get is ""we will get back to you"" or something along the line of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think they understand how serious the smell of a dead rodent rotting within your wall is and they seem to be taking their sweet time. I am quite upset that this process is taking forever and is being underestimated. I would have taken action myself, but I don't think I can just smash the wall open and clean up the mess without having some sort of legal trouble hitting me.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents and some friends have told me to look into legal action, but I am not familiar in that area at all, so here I am. I was wondering if the people of Reddit could help point me in a direction or give me any legal advice.

TLDR at the bottom!*

When we first met 3 years ago, my SO was working on a book about his experiences in a niche field of work but couldn't find a good writer for the job.

As a writer myself I offered to write it - plus 3 more mini ebooks - as well as design the cover, format it (with an app, nothing crazy), find sales channels, market it, etc. Basically, I agreed to do everything because it made me happy. I wasn't great at marketing it but it has sold $2k+ in gross profit regardless, which is not a lot, I know, but it means that I personally earned over $1000.

I know this because I have access to, and keep track of, our sales channels.

When we first self-published it, we agreed that the money we earned would just stay in my SO's business account as a ""rainy day"" or vacation fund. We also agreed in a text that it was a 50-50 split for all gross revenue - that has been the only written agreement but it's been a verbal agreement as well. We also agreed to my name being on the cover along with his name to further claim my involvement, and I am officially listed as the co-author on all our sales channels.

Eventually I became a stay at home mother with zero income. Money got VERY TIGHT. I remembered my 50% portion and realized it would actually wipe out all my credit card debt and then I wouldn't have to worry about that, at least.

When I asked my SO about taking out my portion, he said it was all gone - almost laughing, as if I should've already known this. He used all our gross revenue to pay bills without my knowledge, all of which I did not consent to. He never once asked me if I was ok with this usage of the money, he just went ahead and used all the revenue in any way he saw fit.

The reason I didn't know about this right away: I had set up his business S-Corp account on the book sales channels thinking it would be used strictly for collecting our profit but apparently he uses that for personal checking purposes, too. So the money got mixed in with that, was never separate from his own finances, etc. This means that my half of the money has gone to a number of extremely expensive monthly payments, and a car lease of his that's $1400/month.

I am furious. Weirdly, so is he - he thinks I should be ok with not seeing a dime of this money since it helps ""pay for my life."" He's not wrong, it helps, but I never got to consent to HOW it would help us. He justifies a lot of this in pointing out that he gave me a credit card tied to his accounts - but I am only to use this for necessities like groceries, so it's not really the same thing as having money to do with what you wish. Plus, I can't use that card to pay off my own credit card - my original intent.

I have $20 in my bank account and my SO knows this. I am looking for work but it's even tougher with a baby, and that money could've really helped me since our finances are separate and my SO does not invite me to make any financial decisions, budgets, etc. (clearly)

**My question: Is this considered theft? Can I sue my SO for essentially failing to pay me for my work?**

We are unmarried so maybe that actually simplifies it - it was a project with an agreement and I just didn't get paid. My SO claims I'm getting ""paid"" by staying home and not working, and being ""provided for.""

I mean... I guess I kind of understand? It still doesn't sit well with me.

I'm organizing my exit from this mess of a relationship but I don't know what kind of law this falls under since a child is now involved. I've thought about getting an IP lawyer to help sort it out but maybe family law would be needed too? I also don't have any money, obviously, so I'm at a loss.

Oddly enough, my SO was recorded in an assets separation case against his ex-wife in a deposition as saying that I wrote the books and that half of the money goes to me. My name being on the book was discussed, too, as well as the fact that it implies my 50% ownership in these book projects.

That only further cements the fact that he blatantly violated our simple 50-50 agreement, correct? I can prove with bank statements that zero money has ever gone to me, I have the text saying it's supposed to be 50-50 as well as my texts to him about being concerned that I would not see my half of the money, etcetera.

Thank you for any advice.

Anyways, I woke up today and got an email saying I was getting sued for selling their designs and using their description. By the way, I didn't know I was using their designs I thought they were generic rings on AliExpres. I immediately deleted all the images and descriptions they told me to delete but out of fear of getting in trouble I just took down my entire website and renamed and deactivated my social media page. They asked me to sign a paper and send them all my manufacturing equipment which is my laptop because that's the only thing I use to run my website.

Earlier this year there was a fire that rendered the unit I was originally inhabiting uninhabitable. I have communications from the LL that my unit was not habitable as of the beginning of March, and I know it is uninhabitable right now. They put me in another unit and I signed a new agreement for the new unit, and they were stating that my insurance company would pay the lease on the new unit.

Now several months went by my insurance company stated that they would not pay the lease as the old lease was no longer valid and I should not be paying for the old unit. My insurance rep said they would handle the situation for me. My Insurance agent stated that the landlord would have loss of rental income insurance which would cover them for that unit and that they my insurer would cover my losses and expenses while I was displaced, and because I was given a new unit right away I was no longer displaced. Some more months go on, and I get served an eviction notice for the unit not being paid for. 

The LL claimed at first that they didn't have loss of rental income insurance, and earlier today stated that they did but they could no longer file a claim as it had been over ___ amount of days after the incident. They also claim that if my insurance company doesn't pay for the unit I am liable and they will take me to collections for their money.

Now I'll be clear here I have been paying rent to them on the first of every month I have 5 months worth of bank statements showing this. I also have their communications stating that the units were not habitable. I have the pictures from inside my unit showing all my stuff destroyed.

I have stated to the landlord that if they go after me I will be treating the lease frustrated on the day of the fire because you cannot rent out an uninhabitable unit, and the rent I paid out to them should have been going against the new unit.

I have called the landlord tenancy board, they are less than useful. I talked to a lawyer about it already and they said that they would need to take me to court to take any actions against me. I talked to 2 other landlords in the city about how they would address the fire situation and both of them stated that they would have treated the lease as frustrated from the onset and used their insurance which they have to pay the loss of rental income, they would have provided me with a new lease for the new unit and I would be responsible for that lease not both. I was also told that the eviction notice requires a court order to carry out, and that the landlords could under no terms force me to leave on the date they put on it.

The LL also said I can ignore the notice and it was a computer generated notice that somehow got printed, signed and put on my door. I paid this months rent as my lease agreement expired for the original unit this month and I would be monthly and changed my moveout date until August 5th. 

They say they aren't going to evict me, and in another conversation say they'll take me to collections which will hurt my credit for the unpaid rent unless my insurance company pays them.

My insurance agent hasn't returned my calls in over a month, or the Landlords calls so I am taking that as their answer of they will not pay it.

Is there any merit to what these landlords are trying to do? I am obviously going to get a lawyer here, I have the financial means to pay the rent if I owed it, but I don't pay money out unless I have too.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, the other day I recieved an eviction notice from my current landlord for unpaid rent. &lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

This is in Virginia.

&amp;#x200B;

For some backstory here:

&amp;#x200B;

I've been living in my second floor apartment now going on three years, and they've done me right by everything so far. Any maintenance I call in gets fixed almost the same day if not the next. They're very friendly and I really do love the apartments and the people working here.

&amp;#x200B;

My AC broke in the apartment about two weeks ago now, and i'm heading into my third week with no AC at all. They gave me a window AC unit, but honestly it hardly feels like it's working at all. It's positioned in the largest (and 'only') room they could, which is my living room / kitchen / Dining room. I've closed off my bedroom and my office, and i try to keep as much cool air as I can in my one living space (i'm really getting tired of sleeping on this sofa and wish i could go back to my bedroom). I even have four fans running at top speed, trying to circulate the air and i've been putting ice in front of the box fans to help cool down the room.

&amp;#x200B;

To give you an idea of how hot it is... it's been an average of 90 degrees, and my apartment has been perhaps 3 degrees cooler than that. With the AC unit and fans running at all times.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the time i've been just 'dealing with it', but a lot of people around me express frustration at my situation. I admit, it is frustrating, and every time i check in with them, i'm being told that they're waiting on a part to be delivered from another state.I even just asked for another window AC unit and all i've gotten was that they had 'used their last one' on my unit! I get that some mail takes a while, but from another state? Two weeks? I feel like they should at least express ship it or something.

&amp;#x200B;

I started looking to see if perhaps I could push more legal action (or at least threaten something to kick them into gear)- I know that it's illegal to keep residents apartments without certain temperature conditions, and that's why i'm looking perhaps to see if anyone had feedback here.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My AC has been broken for 2 weeks now. I have a window unit and fans, but the temperature is still at minimum 80 degrees at night and higher during the day. I want to know if I can do anything to push my apartment to do something for this without ruining my good graces with them.

• I live in Ohio


• I'm a 17 year old male 


• I work in the food industry


I am working at my first job as of now for around 3 month and some things have happened that I need some advice on since I'm very uninformed despite looking over child labor laws.


1. My job used to make me take 31 minute breaks every 3 hours, it was raised to 35 minutes today every 3 hours. As said above I am 17 and love in Ohio which means I can work 5 hours straight, legally without a break. I brought this up to them and they said yeah the law says 5 but we enforce 3. I then asked if it was policy for said company and they said yes but when asked for legal signed proof on multiple occasions they provided nothing. They also said they do this because ""labor is high"". Are they allowed to do this by law or am I being taken advantage of and if so what can I do? 


2. They force me to leave if (again) ""labor is too high"". They force me almost twice a week to leave early despite my scheduled and approved by corporate hours. Again I would like to know if this is all covered by law or am I being taken advantage of to save a quick buck?  If I'm being taken advantage of what can I do?


As of now I am stuck working this job while searching (very hard) for a more respectable and better paying job. I would really appreciate all help given. I am doing this on mobile while on my 35 minute forced break, so sorry for poor grammar or formating. If more info is needed please ask and I'll be sure to answer as soon as possible.

My bestfriend is broke and he has a situation here. We are in Canada, so any help from Canadian point of view will be really a help. All the dollar values here are less stuatuory deductions.

My bestfriend was employed in a law firm as bookkeeper a month ago. He was fired citing he was always late to work.

He started a complaint with employmemt standards, and thus received call from his boss who wanted him to take his complaint back inexchange them cleaning his record of employment and termination pay of $1000. He agreed and signed the document but he thinks they scammed him and wants to file civil case. 

On the day he was terminated, his termination letter said that he will be given his due wages of $2000 in 2 days and his accrued vacation pay of $200 will be deposited into his account 15 days later.

Next day when his boss called and it was decided that he will accept $1000 termination pay and clean record of employment and in turn sign a release agreement. The release does not say ""$1000 termination pay"" but just $1000.

He had already received his due wages of $2000. So, he was expecting that he would receive a total $1200 ($1000 termination pay plus $200 accrued vacation), but when he received the cheque, it was for $1000 ($800 termination pay plus $200 accrued vacation). He thought this as a confusion and tried to reach out them. But his email were blocked and no one would attend his call.

Now should he file the complaint with court? Does he has a case?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

He agreed and signed the document but he thinks they scammed him and wants to file civil case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day he was terminated, his termination letter said that he will be given his due wages of $2000 in 2 days and his accrued vacation pay of $200 will be deposited into his account 15 days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next day when his boss called and it was decided that he will accept $1000 termination pay and clean record of employment and in turn sign a release agreement. The release does not say &amp;quot;$1000 termination pay&amp;quot; but just $1000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had already received his due wages of $2000. So, he was expecting that he would receive a total $1200 ($1000 termination pay plus $200 accrued vacation), but when he received the cheque, it was for $1000 ($800 termination pay plus $200 accrued vacation). He thought this as a confusion and tried to reach out them. But his email were blocked and no one would attend his call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now should he file the complaint with court? Does he has a case?&lt;/p&gt;

I am 26 weeks pregnant.  Last week I came down with an illness that left me with a fever and cramping.  I went into the Labor &amp; Delivery ward to get checked out and make sure baby was OK (which they are).

While I was there they ran my blood work 2 times.  They told me they were checking for infection.  I was released the next day after receiving IV fluids and antibiotics.

I have an online portal that allows me to see my test results and message my doctors.  I was scrolling through yesterday and saw a yes labeled “Abuse Drug Panel II”.  I opened the test up and saw the results:

Methamphetamines: negative
Cocaine: negative
Opioids: negative 

Etc, etc....

all of the results were negative as I am not a drug user.

So my question is, I did not consent or have prior knowledge that they were going to test me for illicit drug use.  Now I do not want to pay for the tests, and even if my insurance covers it, I don’t want them to pay the hospital either.

I’m probably out of luck because the hospital makes you sign a “consent to treat” document prior to being admitted.... but this is ridiculous.

I signed a 7 month lease in December and my lease was supposed to be up this Monday the 8th.

Last Sunday i found a place to move into(I have a german shepherd its really hard to find housing for him)and we signed the lease and paid Monday. 

Figuring I would turn in my keys for the apartment on Monday after cleaning it and I would be on my way.

The problem is that my current apartment has a policy of a 60 day written notice of vacating. So i would need to have a place to live 60 days ago. The problem is that I live paycheck to paycheck and run out of money at least once a month sometimes twice. I rely on my parents to not starve(bless them for that). So finding a place to live 2 months out is pretty unrealistic, and, I was trying to move in with friends to save money for college.

So as i walk out of my apartment today I have a letter attached to my door that says I'm late on rent. This makes no sense as i signed a 7 month lease and it was supposed to be up on the 8th. I call the office and they say that because I didnt give them written notice of whether or not I'm vacating 60 days ago they auto renewed my lease until September. On top of that I have LATE FEES for this month because I didnt pay ""my rent"" on the 3rd. After the security deposit and first months rent on the new house I have 26 dollars in my account right now.

So I get the manager to call me and he says they cant go back on the policy(as predatory as it is) or he will get sued. I am basically on the hook for 2 months rent of a place i am supposed to move out of on the 8th. I don't have 1600 dollars for them I starve a few times a month and live below the poverty line. 

I don't know what to do and this is stressing me the fuck out. This is a disgusting way of business and for example my sisters rent is up the 31st of august and she has until that day to renew or not. This is sickening, I cant pay this and its just not right to do this to people struggling. I didn't know if I would find a spot to live until I did this week and if i didnt I was going to re up my rent for a month. 

 Is this even legal? The complex I live in has drug addicts, elderly people, kids and people on supplemental government income. I know for a fact that most of these people don't have extra money and can't drop a security deposit 2 months out if they are moving. Most of my neighbors also live paycheck to paycheck. 


Any advice would be appreciated. Any offices I can contact that help tenants.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a little bit of details first, I live in Tucson, AZ where the tenant laws are apparently pretty bad. I signed a 7 month lease in December and my lease was supposed to be up this Monday the 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday i found a place to move into(I have a german shepherd its really hard to find housing for him)and we signed the lease and paid Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring I would turn in my keys for the apartment on Monday after cleaning it and I would be on my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that my current apartment has a policy of a 60 day written notice of vacating. So i would need to have a place to live 60 days ago. The problem is that I live paycheck to paycheck and run out of money at least once a month sometimes twice. I rely on my parents to not starve(bless them for that). So finding a place to live 2 months out is pretty unrealistic, and, I was trying to move in with friends to save money for college.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to either have the dealer fix it for a discounted price, trade it in for another car, or (the nuclear option and also the option I really want to do first) ask for a full refund minus a little bit for their troubles. 


If what I'm asking is ridiculous and I should have just known how to look at a car and tell what's wrong, then what can I do, still, to at least relatiate in a legal and professional manner. Is there a consumer protection agency that I can make a complaint to? Can I sue for fraud?

I just made this account so I can post this guilt free and nobody can track it. This post also won't be too long, but I can include a TL;DR at the bottom anyway.

So back when I was 16-17 years old, this random ""girl"" adds me on snapchat and I didn't know who she was. Not knowing anything, I add her back and start talking with her. After all, I was 16-17 so I wasn't expecting something like this to happen.

Me and her start talking normally, but strangely enough, she was just texting me, and not sending normal snapchats to me. She said she went to some high school in the area, said she had siblings and what not, so it was kind of normal at first, but suddenly, she started to push the conversation to be more and more sexual. At first I was ok with it, i heard about guys getting sexual on snapchat all the time even when minors so i was into it. She asks for pictures one time, and I unknowningly sent them. When she sends pictures back, they were extremely grainy pictures that were either taken with a terrible phone, or something else. This goes on two or three more times. The first red flag for me was that this was all she would talk to me about. The second red flag was how grainy those pictures were. So one day, I ask her if she can take a normal picture of her holding a bar of soap just to make sure that she is real. Should be easy right? Instead, she kept fighting me, saying ""Oh I am not home"" or ""I shouldn't have to prove myself."" That was when every warning flag went off. When I confronted her about this, she didn't even deny it, instead she said something along the lines of ""Well I have them saved, so you are still going to have to send to me."" Well Fuck.

Next day I walk into high school, and hear that other guys talking about somebody with her username as being a catfish, so I am pretty confident that this isn't an isolated incident. I managed to negotiate with her that I will give her the snapchats of guys as long as she doesn't post my pictures, but I don't even know how to approach that.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I got catfished by a ""girl"" on the internet, no idea who ""she"" is, she has my pictures saved, and is threatening to post them if I don't send more or give her snapchats of guys that I know.

I'm 18M and have autism, but a good job, education, and a place to go (college dorm), to which my parents are preventing me from moving to.

They've always been controlling people. My dad used to spank me with his belt (really fucking hurt), and both gave me homeopathic medicine and essential oils when I was sick, and monitor my computer and phone use because they believed I need to be monitored from porn and ""misinformation"". They also forced Christianity on me and punished me if I resisted. And they wanted to hold my hand every step of the way in me growing up because they believed because I have autism, I'm more immature than most and need to be disciplined.

They didn't even want me to dorm at the bigger state college campus and go to the smaller one because ""I couldn't handle the big campus"". No, I believe it's so they can keep me under their roof and force their ""my house my rules"" shit on me. They wouldn't even let me drive until I turned 18 last year (they DID let me learn, but again, autism).

I've recently applied to college, and they accepted, and my parents were very proud but I sensed that they were also a bit dismayed that I applied to the larger campus. I've also secured a good job and am able to transfer to one of the company's offices near my campus.

Yesterday, my dad went on my computer and found out I'm trying to dorm against their will. My parents then sat me down and told me about how I wasn't supposed to dorm, let alone go to the bigger campus. I told them I'm 18 and allowed to do what I want by now, but they're like ""We're your parents, and what we say goes regardless of your age, as long as you live in our house you will abide by our rules."" And with that they took the keys to my car and my license and parked theirs behind mine so I can't get out.

I then went back on my computer to type this and found out they're trying to get a court appointment to obtain legal guardianship of me and to use my autism to justify it.

I don't want to live in my parents' house anymore. I'm tired of their controlling and policing. If they get guardianship of me then they can keep me at home against my will and prevent me from moving out and I am not having that.

I&amp;#39;ve also secured a good job and am able to transfer to one of the company&amp;#39;s offices near my campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, my dad went on my computer and found out I&amp;#39;m trying to dorm against their will. My parents then sat me down and told me about how I wasn&amp;#39;t supposed to dorm, let alone go to the bigger campus. I told them I&amp;#39;m 18 and allowed to do what I want by now, but they&amp;#39;re like &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re your parents, and what we say goes regardless of your age, as long as you live in our house you will abide by our rules.&amp;quot; And with that they took the keys to my car and my license and parked theirs behind mine so I can&amp;#39;t get out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went back on my computer to type this and found out they&amp;#39;re trying to get a court appointment to obtain legal guardianship of me and to use my autism to justify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to live in my parents&amp;#39; house anymore. I&amp;#39;m tired of their controlling and policing. If they get guardianship of me then they can keep me at home against my will and prevent me from moving out and I am not having that. Is there anything I can do?&lt;/p&gt;

This hearing took place recently.

During the Adjudication Hearing for our current foster child, JFS brought a witness (intake case worker) to attest Bio-Mom’s drug use before, during, and after birth. The alleged father also confirmed this in the hearing. After their testimony, JFS presented six Exhibits to the Magistrate which they reviewed after shutting down the mics.

When the Magistrate was ready to begin again they stated they were disturbed by what they read and were willing to terminate the Bio-Mom’s rights. Except JFS had not submitted if Bio-Mom legally had her rights terminated to two other children in a neighboring county due to her extensive drug and alcohol abuse/addiction.

Everyone had stated and agreed these children existed (an adoptive parent for one child had shown at the previous adjudication hearing attempt) but no legal evidence had been presented. The county with the information hadn’t responded to the request for said information. This held the Magistrate back from their decision and they just set a review hearing for three months later.

When the mics were off again the Magistrate targeted the county’s Case-Worker. He slowly and deliberately walked them through a series of questions essentially to make JFS admit they have access to an Ohio-wide legal database. This validated database evidently has the legal confirmation the Magistrate needed to terminate rights and the case worker had the data printed out in front of them complete with highlighting in different colors.

The JFS Lawyer (I assume here as they did the speaking), simply said “if you’ve seen the Chernobyl documentary, trust but verify” as to why this information was not submitted. The Magistrate just nodded along.

So my wife has been having multiple issues with a small company she's been working for. It's in Southern California, Orange County and they have under 40 employees or the number to be considered a small business.   


So the first issue is missed paychecks. She's supposed to be paid bi-weekly but the payroll has been 1-3 days late for the past 3 weeks. Not terrible, but it's happening for most of the people working there as well and I'm sure people are depending on the money way more than she does. Also, the paid hours is incorrect for some people, we don't think she's been affected but we don't want this to be a future issue, where would I go for these problems?  


Second issue, at their secondary store, they have had plumbing issues and they are telling them not to go number 2 or if they do, to remove it and dispose of it elsewhere. Absolutely ludicrous. They are making no effort to fix the plumbing because that would cost them a lot of money. The owners are also foreign so they believe that you can't flush toilet paper without doing damage to the plumbing. They have been instructed to throw it in the trash after wiping and the owners have already been doing this. The latter also applies to the primary store where she works. This has to be multiple violations of health code and I was wondering where to go for these complaints. 

&amp;#x200B;

I regret this decision entirely and will never do business with a friend again, however I need to explain my predicament so that I can remove myself from future obligations and liabilities.

Upon completion of the site, I launched it live and completed the site to original agreed on terms, in writing, where she signed my master services agreement. She failed to do any documenting of our agreement and I did not sign anything of hers.

Since then, she has come out wanting more and more things done to the site, none of which were a part of the original conversation or agreement in writing. I told her she would have to pay an hourly fee for more work, as I believe $1300 in men's haircuts a are going to last me a while and I have no further desire for more service credit. This ""displeased"" her, and she tried to get me to come in, give me a haircut, while she had an employee act as a witness and take notes on our prospective business dealings, of which, I at the end said verbally that I do not agree to those terms.

Since then, I have tried to book a haircut twice, but each time have been given the run around and either 
A - she isn't available (she only does haircuts Thursday through Saturday, which was not disclosed to me up front)
B - she is traveling
C - she refuses to pay any of her staff to cut my hair

I have tried to pre book a time slot twice, both within 4 days of the call. 

I believe that she does not intend to fulfill her obligations of the contract and frankly it's not worth showing up to court over. 

From what I understand and have read, this could be considered a renunciatory breach of contract as she has not made reasonable effort or shown intention to accommodate in a way that grants the benefit my party is due. 

We did not set terms for timing of appointments, which was foolish, but I believe is an innominate term, and could still hold up that there is expectation of reasonable access to services?

I wish to give her notice of her breach of contract, pull the website down, and terminate our agreement so that I don't have to deal with her anymore. This is childish and I just don't want to work with people who do this kinda thing. 

If I did terminate and pulled the website, would I be liable to return the $500 in cash? I'm out about 16 hours of my time, if which I charge $60 an hour, so I can't imagine having to pay that back.

This included my first weekly pay of $400, plus the funds to purchase a printer and the software through an independent seller. After depositing this check in person at my local BOA office, I waited till the amount hit my account and could be used. Kunal informed me that I pay $2500 for the printer, plus $300 for shipping. He even asked when I will be available to receive the printer at my apartment and sign off on the delivery. As you can tell, this is an elaborate scheme and I fell prey to it. 

A few days later, bank of America took the money back because the check was deemed to be fraud. I called BOA as soon as I noticed the ""low account balance"" alert on my phone and was told that they initially deposited the funds to my account under good faith. But when they went to Chase, they said no this check is fraud. Then BOA proceeded to remove the entire amount from my account, as well as charge me a fee for the check bounce. Now, my account is in the negatives and I am doing anything I can to not pay for somebody else's fraud. 

As of now, I have filed a complaint with BOA's fraud department, as well as complaints with several government agencies. Will filing a police report help my case? After researching, turns out the company itself put out a warning against job fraud (which would have been helpful to find sooner): [https://www.sgsgroup.us.com/en/our-company/careers/fraudulent-job-offers-warning](https://www.sgsgroup.us.com/en/our-company/careers/fraudulent-job-offers-warning) Additionally, I have contacted the company (SGS) under which my ""boss"" works for, as well as contacting them on Facebook.

Any tips/suggestions on what I can do?

Hi there. I’m a woman in my late 20s living in New York City, hopefully someone can help!

I received a job offer after three rounds of interviews at a nonprofit in New York City. Up until that point, everyone had been extremely positive and seemed excited for me to work there. References from both my previous job and the one before that were glowing. 

I then asked via email if I could receive a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, citing a disability. My ask was to have the flexibility to work from home one day a week. I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Their response was that they do provide reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities as long as the staff member can still fulfill the essential functions of the job. So, they sent me a questionnaire about my disability, diagnosis, and how it might affect my ability to do the job to be completed by my provider. My therapist answered all of their questions, saying that she thought things were in a managed place and that I was ready to work there.

After that questionnaire, I was told the CEO wanted to speak with my therapist, with my permission. Despite the fact it left me feeling extremely vulnerable, they spoke on the phone about other aspects of the job that might be an issue for me, and my therapist recommended the CEO and HR speak with me about my thoughts on those issues. That seemed positive.

Now, I get another email from HR asking me to come in for a meeting next week to do that - but they’re also asking if I am willing to give them my former supervisor’s information so they can speak with them as a reference.

An important thing to note is that I was technically fired from my last job, though I had planned on quitting weeks before. I had been harassed since my start (I worked there two years) by a male employee, with reports about this person ignored - in fact after one claim, he was promoted two weeks later. I had reported, via multiple avenues, issues with office culture, diversity, favoritism, sexism and other toxic aspects that went left unattended. A round of new hires left me extremely anxious in the office and I would frequently have to leave because of panic attacks and massive anxiety. At this point, I hadn’t really understood many of my diagnoses and had not asked for accommodations of any sort. I went from being an employee with near-perfect reviews and consistent raises to getting a warning and being fired the next week - before that there was no contact from HR or any other warning from my boss. My goal, with a new job in a new industry, was to be as honest as it was safe for me to be, and ask for the things I needed, having a better understanding of my condition. I did not lie when asked about my previous job and what had happened, but I was vague enough so as to not incriminate myself.

I’m unsure about the following things:

1. Is it legal for them to ask for more references now that I have a job offer, since the only reason they’re asking is related to a disability?
2. Is any of this discriminatory?
3. What can I do in this situation?
4. Is this a normal reaction from employers? It seems excessive to me, considering I’m only asking for some work from home flexibility....

If I inherit his house, which has no encumberances on it, but is in unlivable condition, do I have any legal way to destroy the house and just collect the insurance money?

I  am presently couch surfing with friends and have a German Shepherd. I have a storage unit I keep my stuff in. The storage unit company has an on site 2 bedroom suite for the manager (M) to stay. (M) and her boyfriend recently broke up and he is moving out of state and now M needs help. The company said for her to hire someone it has to come out of M pocket and they don’t seem to want her to hire anyone. The complex seems like it could be run by one person but she feels like she could use help. M’s daughter just recently flew to Arizona and she doesn’t know when she’ll be back so she doesn’t know how long our agreement would stay in place. It sounds like she won’t be back for a while. I believe she lives in Arizona.

The agreement would be that I help at the facility in exchange for free rent. I would stay as long as her daughter doesn’t come back. I am presently looking for a 9-5 job and have put in lots of applications as well as gone to a temp agency who said I should be hired by someone by or around August. M says that’s fine and I can bring my German Shepherd. M has two dogs about half my dogs size who she said can be kind of temperamental but should be fine. All this would be off the record as she doesn’t know how her bosses would feel about this and if they come around (which doesn’t happen often) she won’t tell them I rent a storage unit there and will just say I’m a friend staying with her. They didn’t have a problem with her boyfriend or daughter so it should be fine. I will still be paying for my storage unit.

I work in the medical field as an assistant manager, today I was in charge as the general manager took today off. 

My office has surgeons that are ""on-call"" if a patient is seen in the ER and needs a follow-up with the specialist that doctor reviews xrays and determines how quickly the patient needs to be seen. Long story short, our ""emergency form"" (that has some patient demographics, the diagnosis and doctor notes) went to the wrong doctor. Come to find out the patient needs surgery on Monday. The doctor that is doing the surgery called the general manager complaining about the delay in care for this patient. Should be noted the surgery is not an emergent situation, which is why the surgery is Monday. 

The general manager calls me and asks me to take a picture of the""emergency form"" and send it to her-- she wants to see the notes and try to figure out the handwriting and thus who wrote the wrong doctors name. 

I didn't question it and send the picture of the ""emergency form"" and I am now freaking out to the point that I think I may be fired come Monday. 

Is there a basis for my termination or a write up?

I thought of texting my manager about it, but my S/O talked me out of it. Should I even bring it up on Monday or wait until the manager does? Idk what to do here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;AR, USA&lt;/p&gt;

Hoping this hasn’t been asked before. My husband took out a citibike for a one way ride a few months ago in Brooklyn New York. By all signs he docked it properly - he saw the green light and manually tried to pull it back out again and was unable to. 

Two weeks ago we went to rent a new bike and noticed that his bike from two months ago was never checked back in. No one from citibike called him during this two month period. He did not have notifications enabled so he just never noticed. We realize he should have double checked his app after docking to make sure it worked, but he had used it several times before with no issues and just didn’t. We called the company two weeks ago and they said we may be charged a 1200 lost bike fee but they would investigate the matter and call us back in 5 days. They still hadn’t called us back in almost two weeks so I called again today and they said they’d give me a call back in 24 hours and “escalated the matter to management”. 

While searching on the internet we found an identical story happened to someone at the very same docking station my husband used. This would indicate to me that there is something wrong with a docking station there or perhaps their system goes down at that station frequently. I really feel it’s unfair for us to have to pay $1200 if it was a problem on their end. I included the user agreement which seems kind of vague and the news clipping. 

Is there anything we can do to fight this? Should we try and contact a lawyer or do we not have a case because of the user agreement? Should we have our credit card company try and fight it (Amex)? What are our options?

I am 17 years old, and after three months of working at Subway I still have not received any sort of official break at my work, such as an unpaid 30 minute break for working more than 5 hours. I have worked 8 hour shifts and have not had any break.

On my first day of work, I asked my coworkers how breaks work and they laughed and said we don't get breaks. If we want to ""rest"" for a few minutes in the back, we have to interrupt that resting period to help customers if any walk up wanting to buy something. The only time I get uninterrupted breaks, such as a ten minute break, is if a coworker agrees to watch the front of the store for me. However, I have worked alone for hours at a time before, causing me to not be allowed any break during that time. So, I get to have a short break at times, but no 30 minute breaks at all.

On top of this issue I am having with breaks, I work alone sometimes and there is also a minor here (17 years old) who opens and closes the store by themself and who was made a supervisor. I am wondering how legal this is as well and if it is legal for the manager to be letting minors work alone. My Subway is located in a mall, so I am not sure if that makes a difference or not regarding those two things.

We only have 6 workers total at my work, 5 of which are minors and one is 18, and none of us receive breaks during our shifts. It causes everyone to always be tired and irritated. So, I am wondering, is this legal? Also, is it legal to leave minors working alone as well as open and close alone in a mall? It is hard for me to find information online about these things.

Also, if any of these things are illegal, what steps should I take to stop it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in Washington State and am working as a &amp;quot;Sandwich-Artist&amp;quot; at Subway.

&lt;p&gt;On my first day of work, I asked my coworkers how breaks work and they laughed and said we don&amp;#39;t get breaks.

 I previously posted here about my roommates who are a couple (26f) &amp;amp; (18f) who constantly fight to the point where holes have been smashed into walls, bruises appear on each of them the next day, the yelling is so loud I’m honestly shocked my neighbors haven’t called the cops on us yet. 

In that post I went into detail about how my I’m basically being held hostage because my apartment community wouldn’t let me out of the lease unless I had a police report. I called the police who advised they could not make a report unless a victim comes forward and I was not considered a victim in situations where they were being physically violent to each other.  One of them would have to come forward and we’ll, they’re dating so that isn’t going to happen.


 Today at approx. 2:00pm after a heated text conversation about my not wanting to live with my two other roommates due to their constant arguing, damage to property and theft of my own property, the 18f year old ran from a neighbors apartment where she &amp;amp; her 26f year gf (they are both my roommates)had been hanging out. She runs out and slammed a hole into my bedroom window... all because I THREATENED to call the police on her gf for providing alcohol to a minor if they wouldn’t agree to let me out of this lease. So. She. Smashed.my.window. 
Shattered glass ALL over my puppy’s home. Luckily, I had a blanket cover his cage so he is fine....

After breaking my window, she then ran to the front door, rushed into our home and put her hands on both me and a visitor (24m)I had over. We both pushed her off of us.. (18f is also 5’11 and weight about 240lbs.. she a big girl) and retreated to my bedroom. I was in fear for my safety and immediately called 911. When The officers arrived they gave zero shits about the destruction to my window. They only offered only to issue EVERYONE with assault charges and stated we could dispute it in court. Apparently 18f stayed my visitor had hit her in the face which is absolutely false. 

I repeatedly begged “but my window!?” “I have blood on my chest and scratches!” 

He told me there was nothing he could do about the window because he it was 18f’s window also. What!? I literally was on the advised by 911 dispatch to get away from them as they yelled and screamed at me in the house but some how I am not a victim because they stated they weren’t there!? 
 Is this legal!?



I have a clean record and risking a assault charge was in no way an option for me. I did, however, after crying like a baby about how these apartments won’t release me because I am the only one with income in the house therefor my two shitty roommates do not have proof of income to show they can sustain this apartment themselves. 

After crying and explains all this to police officer finally a second officer gave me his card with a police report # attached. He stated it would be a small report about everything that transpired, including their false statements of me and my guest attacking 18f. I’m planning on taking this the leasing manager first thing tomorrow morning at office opening.

My question is... previously everyone on here advised me to call the police every time a incident with my roommates occurred. But with what happened today... I feel like I almost caused myself more harm than good by almost getting an assault charge. 

TLDR; roommates are abusive, steal from me and I’m trying to get out of my lease but my apartment won’t let me without a police report. One of them smashed my window open and I called the cops, cops said all they could do is issue everyone assault charges since they were here to see what happened. How do I get out of this lease if this is the result when the cops are called and did the police really do all that they could have? 18f wasn’t even given a breathalyzer and I had told them my other 26f roommate feeds her alcohol as a desperate attempt to get something documented for me to get out of this lease","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, this one is a long one-

My name is Josh and i was 51/50’d at 6:33pm at Kaiser ER by a cop. Prior to this, I was at my therapy session with my therapist that was connected to me by Kaiser. I live in Marin County, California. 

If any of you are not familiar with the 51/50 process, you are considered a harm to yourself, to others, or mentally incapacitated. They take all your belongings— keys, phone, wallet, and are transferred to a psychiatric hospital. 

The problem is that my car was parked at the therapy facility. During my 72 hour hold, they had towed my car from that facility. I was released yesterday and are now presented with a $410 towing charge, despite being held against my will and not allowing me to speak/access any one during my hold (they only gave me a few minutes to retrieve phone numbers, since no one knew where I was since entering the facility, hours away from my home.)

I have contacted Kaiser and their department secretary and she stated that Kaiser only cover medical expenses. I have also contacted the property manager to discuss mitigation of cost but they have been difficult to reach.

Not sure what to do at this point, or whether to pay for the car tow now and worry about reimbursement later since cost accrues per day. All in all, this system for 51/50 sucks and burdens the already vulnerable population of people that need help.

I have a vague understanding of copyright law, and I know that copyright law around 'news aggregators' is a kind of gray area, from what I've read.

Ideally, I'd want to also include some functionality that would be based around ""commentary"" of either the article, source, author, or so on.

I live on a farm that my SO manages, he works for a parent company with many small organic farms in our area. We all rent dumpsters from a local dumpster rental place. We have 2 on the farm, a single sort recycling dumpster, and a general waste dumpster. For the last seven months, we have seen the ""trash man"" dump both dumpsters into the same truck. I tried not to step on my SO's toes and get involved, but I think he's afraid to make too many waves in his new role as Farm Manager, and he hasn't told his supervisor. (I know. We should've called sooner, I'm sorry for sucking as a human.)

Last week I finally called the dumpster company and complained. They didn't ask my name, or where I lived. Just said ""I'm not the first one to call about the issue."" And said they'd look into it. 

Is there somewhere else I can report their terrible service too? The farm pays to rent a single sort recycling dumpster that hasn't been used for seven months.

A few months back, I woke up to cops outside my apartment calling my phone, telling me my motorcycle was pushed over. I went outside and sure enough, it was purposely pushed over by somebody and on its way down scraped the car in the next parking spot. 

The cops logged this as criminal mischief with no suspect, and that was that. The car owner took my number but I didn't hear back for a couple weeks. When he did decide to call me, he told me his insurance wouldn't cover it and he wanted me to pay. I asked him for his insurance info first and when I called the company, they said there was never any indication they wouldn't pay, and he specifically opted out of insurance coverage. 


I text him about this and he responded, saying he didn't want to pay the deductible because it wasn't worth it, and wanted me to pay instead. His quote was about $900. I don't have that money, nor do I feel it's my responsibility to pay. As a friend said it-'if somebody stole your baseball bat and beat somebody else with it, you wouldn't be charged with assault just because it was your bat.' 
However, I do want to double check where I am here because he texts me often saying he's going to take me to court and escalate this and blah blah.

Further things to note: we did not sign our w2's or w4's until about 2 weeks into work. Our salary was never discussed upon meeting the owners of the station even after we had gone through orientation and the signing of our legal papers. 

No copy of ID has been taken even though they did say they wanted to. It doesn't seem like they are going to ever do that at this point. 

Last note to take on this case is there are 3 meals a day (free) with a hired cook who is good and free housing that is ""a step above camping"" quite literally.

Hello, I have worked at my current job for 10 years. Recently the safety of my job has been extremely questionable, and I’ve been terrified to go to work but as a manager still have to. I feel i am unprotected as well as my associates are. 

Without giving too much detail away out of respect(and concern) for my job/company, we have to call the police anytime we are threatened and this means calling almost 3 times a day. 

Anyways, this morning a group of people I called the police on at my job before jumped me on public transportation on my way to work today.’I was injured pretty bad, they said “do you remember us cause we remember you” before attacking me.

My HR department is being very giving, truly because the company I work for is scared of getting anymore bad press at this point. 

However, I’ve talked a lot to my family and I don’t think I can return to this job and feel protected, even though this has been my career and was going to be for the rest of my life.

LONG STORY SHORT: if I decide to ultimately leave since they will not change the security measures needed to protect the team, am I able to ask for pay for that? 

I’ve given my entire adult life to this company, literally. It breaks my heart that my safety is compromised because of procedures in place to protect me, and I cannot stand for this to happen to someone else.

I came over to her house today, we had fun together, whatever. At around 6 P.M. her parents left because they’re going on a cruise for a few days. Sarah let me stay over so she doesn’t get lonely and all.

At about 1:10 A.M. she went to bed. She told me to sleep in her room on the floor, so i got ready and headed in at around 1:15.

I thought about approaching him but I was afraid he’d have a weapon so I quietly shut the door and tried to ignore it all by going back to bed.

It’s now 2:55 and I can’t sleep but I don’t hear any noise anywhere so I assume he is gone. I’m assuming he stole something valuable because he didn’t bother the only two people in the house and everything looks the same from the dining room to Sarah’s room.

I’m not going to say anything about it if I’m asked because that might me look suspicious, but more importantly I’m afraid that boy will hurt me if he finds out I saw him and all else. I’m assuming he’s the teenage son of a neighbor who is close with Sarah’s parents and thus found out that they’re gone for a cruise.

But I was wondering what the legal consequences would be if I was caught knowing all of this and not telling anyone?

&lt;p&gt;It’s now 2:55 and I can’t sleep but I don’t hear any noise anywhere so I assume he is gone. I’m assuming he stole something valuable because he didn’t bother the only two people in the house and everything looks the same from the dining room to Sarah’s room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to say anything about it if I’m asked because that might me look suspicious, but more importantly I’m afraid that boy will hurt me if he finds out I saw him and all else. I’m assuming he’s the teenage son of a neighbor who is close with Sarah’s parents and thus found out that they’re gone for a cruise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was wondering what the legal consequences would be if I was caught knowing all of this and not telling anyone? Because I don’t want to be involved in this, it really has nothing to do with me in the slightest. But I’m extremely paranoid and I can’t even fall asleep anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m in Florida, US.

Background on the situation: 

My parents chose to give me my mom’s maiden name as a second middle name, and my dad’s surname as my last name. This was intended to make things less complicated for me when registering for school, etc. and it did. 

Well, I found out early this year that due to clerical error, my name was recorded wrong on my birth certificate/social security card, so rather than having two middle names, my legal surname is “Mom’s maiden name (space) Dad’s last name.” No hyphen in between. I never knew this because the format of my social security card &amp;amp; birth certificate both make it hard to tell. There’s simply slightly more spacing between my middle name and last name(s), so all this time it was all but indiscernible. 

Evidently it was just as indiscernible to pretty much everyone else, because my learner’s permit, passport, registration at university, medical records....all of my legal documents aside from my birth certificate and SS card list my dad’s surname as my surname. This has never been a problem for me at all, and the government has never had any issue verifying that I’m the same person, so it’s been fine. 

Here’s where it gets a bit complicated: 

I’m female-to-male transgender, so I’m planning on getting my first and middle name changed legally fairly soon. I’m not too worried about that, as I hear it’s easy aside from having to go in front of a judge, which sounds nerve-wracking, but I’ll survive. *Note: if anyone has any extra information about legal first/middle name change procedures in Florida, please share in the comments.*

When I get my other name changes, I’d like to get my surname changed as well, to exclusively my dad’s surname. Firstly because I have a strained relationship with my mother, secondly because I’ve always been known by my dad’s last name anyway. 

I’ve heard getting your surname changed is often more difficult, but I don’t know if this is true. I’m assuming that because I’d be changing my name to something that was already a part of my last name, which also happens to be my father’s surname (as is typical), it will be easier to change/get approved. 

However, I’m no longer a minor (19), and I’ve heard it’s easier for children to get their surnames changed while they’re still under their parents’ roof, especially in the case of divorce and wanting to take on one parent’s last name (my parents are divorced, FWIW), but again, I don’t know how true this is.

My fiancé has a position managing a newly opened restaurant and the owner is putting us in quite a pickle. I’ll try to give as much information about the situation as I possibly can because I’m not too sure what is or may be relevant.

So this new restaurant had its soft opening about two weeks ago. Before that however, the owner personally poached my fiancé from another managing job in which she was unhappy. It took the restaurant longer to open than expected so she was left without pay for close to a month and a half. Since she was promised $1,000/week at this new job (as opposed to the $11/hour she had been making) she decided to not ask for compensation for the time she spent waiting for them to open without a job. 

A month and a half later the restaurant opens but since payroll hadn’t been started the owner just paid her out of pocket. He paid her $400 for the week leading up to the soft opening. And another $400 for the first week on a sort of impromptu payroll (A total of $1,200 less than what she was promised). He told her that “money is tight” right now and that he will get her “up to $1,000” in the future. He’s promising to pay her $850 + $850 for the next two weeks of work (which is still short). 

In addition to all of this she has been working nonstop open to close every single day since the soft opening. She’s been able to take maybe a handful of 1-2 hour breaks. As of right now (the first Friday of the new two week pay period) she is already at 49hours. She and the bar manager are in the same situation and have talked to the owner together asking for either benefits, overtime pay or to be worked less than 40hrs/week and he has shot them both down.

The bar manager is planning on waiting until the end of the month and if the issues are not resolved simply walking away and suing the owner. 

My fiancé however is a very kind hearted person who tries to avoid confrontation and would rather keep her job as opposed to quitting.

We also can’t afford the lawyer fees right now and she is, to my dismay, afraid to push the issue with her boss for fear of getting fired.

She is by far the most important employee at the restaurant as she is the one who hired/trained all of the front of house staff, the bar staff and the kitchen staff. She makes the schedules and fixes everything that goes wrong including doing the office managers job. 

Her and the bar manager also have to be at work at all times because they are picking up the slack for the kitchen manager (and the kitchen in general).

All of this is really stressing her out and I’d like to try and offer her some options so I guess my questions would be; what can she and the bar manager do in this situation? What are they legally entitled to?

Thank you all for your time!

United States

Background:

I used to travel quite frequently for work, and when I moved back to the area, I had no furniture and basically only needed a room to rent. I found this roommate(let’s call her R) on Craigslist, and at the time, she was living in another house with another person and they were seeking a third roommate. It quickly became apparent that the house was basically R’s, and that the other roommate and I were only renting rooms. 

R and I basically both kept to ourselves for most of that time we lived in that house (about 8 months). When the lease ended, R and I found a new place and signed a lease together. We split the security deposit. 

Things were not by any means ideal in the new house, and sharing a bathroom + space with R was an adjustment. I was still traveling semi-regularly for work during the first year, and so it was basically a place to crash. 

R has always enforced this idea that it isn’t my house — she frequently just tells me that her friends, family members, and/or her partner are coming to stay at our house for extended periods of time - her partner will come stay for a month about 2-3 times a year. I have only received payment on bills for this one time during this time, during the first year of the lease (which made me think maybe it will happen every now and then — but it doesn’t). I have brought it up more than once. 

About 2 months after we re-signed the lease for this year and I started a new job with different hours, I was around more frequently, and we began to not get along.
Since this time there have been several clashes due to living styles and cleanliness levels, and I have been extremely uncomfortable in the home — because I feel like no space there is mine, except my room, and that I have paid 1/2 of bills and rent for 1 room so that one of my roommate’s friends etc can basically live there for free 1/3 of the time. I also feel like R feels as though she is being fair. 

Because of these feelings and my uncomfortableness there, I have been spending most of my time at my boyfriend’s house during the last 6 months. I only cook at his house also, so I don’t use the kitchen at my roommate’s house other than the fridge for storage.

I moved out 1 month and 2 weeks early, with the intention of getting someone to sublet my room. I cleaned my room very well, and I cleaned the cabinet and shelves in the kitchen that I used for storage. I cleaned the areas of the bathroom that I kept my stuff. All of this stuff is move-out levels of cleanliness.

Since I moved out, R has resigned the lease. There is one month until the end of our lease and I have paid the rent for this month while living in my new place. I have to go back to the house and pick up some cleaning supplies.

Because R is staying, I agreed to do a walkthrough with her of (what I planned to be) my areas of inhabitance... since agreeing to this walkthrough, R has texted me multiple times insisting that I help her “spring clean” the entire house (something she never did when I lived there). She believes that even areas that contain none of my stuff and that I haven’t used ever or in months are my responsibility -  Like she actually expects me to move her furniture and kitchen items and clean underneath them. I have indulged some of this in the entryway I used, because I have a dog and there was hair to clean. I also wiped the baseboards and a few other things, but I consider this to be enough. 

When I moved into the old house, only the areas I was moving into were move in ready. She’s insisting on cleaning the entire house before even showing it to anyone, and at this point I have basically decided I would rather not even try to get someone to sublet just because I don’t want to deal with her. It’s gotten to the point that she is nagging me and insisting that it’s my responsibility to split these duties with her or to hire someone and split the costs.

Here’s an actual text she sent: “I re-signed the lease with Orange so I’ve got a couple folks lined up that want to see the place (one who would like to move in sooner than later). But of course i won’t show it until the whole house has been thoroughly cleaned. I’ve continued working on it over the weekend but it still has a long way to go. Do you have an idea when you’ll be back to help with more cleaning? Alternatively I know a woman looking for cleaning work and I can hire her and we could split the cost if you prefer”

All of the areas she’s talking about cleaning are areas that were made dirty by her and her many guests. I refuse to do any more work or to pay any more money.

I am still supposed to do a walkthrough, but I feel as though she’s going to try to ask me to do excessive things and it could escalate. I have taken photos of the communal areas I cleaned “before” and I do have a list of the stuff I did.

I’m also worried she is going to try to screw me on the security deposit if I don’t help her clean her mess, because she’s still living there. 


tl;dr: I moved out early because of a dirty, inconsiderate roommate. I agreed to a walkthrough of (what I thought) was my areas of inhabitance. Since this agreement, my old roommate is insisting I come and help clean up their mess and walkthrough the entire house. 

I paid the security deposit to a rental company, but because she re-signed the lease they are considering it a renewal and want the money to stay in trust. Basically, they told me that a roommate normally pays the other roommate 1/2 of the security deposit when the other moves out... R is obviously trying to force me to clean etc. due to this, because she knows she is in control of the money. However, all the stipulations of my lease with the rental company have been met, and she is trying to hold me to her own rules to receive my $. I have talked to the rental company but I have to wait to talk to someone else on Monday. I told R I would be back this week to finish some stuff up, but I’m not going back until I speak to the landlord.

Have I met my legal obligations? Is the landlord allowed to do this with the money? It seems illegal that they would give a random person control over another person’s security deposit. 

What are my options regarding small claims court?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crosspost from &lt;a href=""/r/relationships""&gt;r/relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United States&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to travel quite frequently for work, and when I moved back to the area, I had no furniture and basically only needed a room to rent. I found this roommate(let’s call her R) on Craigslist, and at the time, she was living in another house with another person and they were seeking a third roommate. It quickly became apparent that the house was basically R’s, and that the other roommate and I were only renting rooms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R and I basically both kept to ourselves for most of that time we lived in that house (about 8 months). When the lease ended, R and I found a new place and signed a lease together. We split the security deposit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were not by any means ideal in the new house, and sharing a bathroom + space with R was an adjustment. I was still traveling semi-regularly for work during the first year, and so it was basically a place to crash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R has always enforced this idea that it isn’t my house — she frequently just tells me that her friends, family members, and/or her partner are coming to stay at our house for extended periods of time - her partner will come stay for a month about 2-3 times a year. I have only received payment on bills for this one time during this time, during the first year of the lease (which made me think maybe it will happen every now and then — but it doesn’t). I have brought it up more than once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2 months after we re-signed the lease for this year and I started a new job with different hours, I was around more frequently, and we began to not get along.
Since this time there have been several clashes due to living styles and cleanliness levels, and I have been extremely uncomfortable in the home — because I feel like no space there is mine, except my room, and that I have paid 1/2 of bills and rent for 1 room so that one of my roommate’s friends etc can basically live there for free 1/3 of the time. I also feel like R feels as though she is being fair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of these feelings and my uncomfortableness there, I have been spending most of my time at my boyfriend’s house during the last 6 months. I only cook at his house also, so I don’t use the kitchen at my roommate’s house other than the fridge for storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved out 1 month and 2 weeks early, with the intention of getting someone to sublet my room. I cleaned my room very well, and I cleaned the cabinet and shelves in the kitchen that I used for storage. I cleaned the areas of the bathroom that I kept my stuff. All of this stuff is move-out levels of cleanliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I moved out, R has resigned the lease. There is one month until the end of our lease and I have paid the rent for this month while living in my new place. I have to go back to the house and pick up some cleaning supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because R is staying, I agreed to do a walkthrough with her of (what I planned to be) my areas of inhabitance... since agreeing to this walkthrough, R has texted me multiple times insisting that I help her “spring clean” the entire house (something she never did when I lived there). She believes that even areas that contain none of my stuff and that I haven’t used ever or in months are my responsibility -  Like she actually expects me to move her furniture and kitchen items and clean underneath them. I have indulged some of this in the entryway I used, because I have a dog and there was hair to clean. I also wiped the baseboards and a few other things, but I consider this to be enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved into the old house, only the areas I was moving into were move in ready. She’s insisting on cleaning the entire house before even showing it to anyone, and at this point I have basically decided I would rather not even try to get someone to sublet just because I don’t want to deal with her. It’s gotten to the point that she is nagging me and insisting that it’s my responsibility to split these duties with her or to hire someone and split the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an actual text she sent: “I re-signed the lease with Orange so I’ve got a couple folks lined up that want to see the place (one who would like to move in sooner than later). But of course i won’t show it until the whole house has been thoroughly cleaned. I’ve continued working on it over the weekend but it still has a long way to go. Do you have an idea when you’ll be back to help with more cleaning? Alternatively I know a woman looking for cleaning work and I can hire her and we could split the cost if you prefer”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the areas she’s talking about cleaning are areas that were made dirty by her and her many guests. I refuse to do any more work or to pay any more money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still supposed to do a walkthrough, but I feel as though she’s going to try to ask me to do excessive things and it could escalate. I have taken photos of the communal areas I cleaned “before” and I do have a list of the stuff I did.&lt;/p&gt;

It's pretty long but I would definitely appreciate the responses. I am located in San Jose, CA. I have an issue that has repeated itself. I have the right to believe that the restaurant I’m working at right now has a manager that has been stealing tips from the employees. It's a chain restaurant like Cheesecake Factory or Maggiano's. I currently work as carry-out aside from the other duties I do but that is my main job at the moment. The way I believe tips were stolen were set through the system. I currently work as carry-out and in the pantry but this will concern the carry-out side.

When people set up orders either online or big catering orders through the management and that’s what is a BEO.

A banquet event order for catering.

When I set up those orders, it's available to me through the POS System to close out, and with closing those out I am able to collect the check in my name considering that is the work I have done and that is the order I have fulfilled.

I do these orders and sometimes there is a driver hired by the restaurant through door dash when it comes to delivery for those. Since the check is closed through me, with my years of working here I have been informed that only I keep those tips, and if there is someone else working with me we share them as we both did the work. Along with also sharing some of the pool with the kitchen. (This will apply to my story later)

The only way we would share tips for a delivery is if our store had a driver, where then we would share tips with the driver (we used to have one before the management that is here currently)

I believe this manager is stealing tips is through this way.

Instead of the order being available on my system as I mentioned earlier so that I could close out, I am assuming he transfers it to his own account or another account where he can close out, and safely remove the cash from the register or safe for himself with no repercussions.

He instead will show me the ticket that comes out of the cook's printer and tells me that is the order, not providing anything but the name and the items listed.

For the first time I’ve experienced this, we had received an order from another restaurant which unfortunately was flooded, and so the BEO was transferred to the location I work at where customers had to pick up their catering order through us.

When seeing this BEO there was a tip on it. Me and a co-worker would be able to split it once completing the order but we were wondering how to be able to submit it into the system since it was not showing in the system, meaning someone else closed it out, or it made sense that since it was a transferred order it did not appear set in our system for that day, meaning the order had to be just told to the cooks.

I was working alone in the morning and was the first to ask this to the manager.

When asking the manager about how I would put in the tips, I was told “This doesn’t apply to you since it is an order from the other store”

This made me wonder, then who does the money go to, it would make sense if the other store collects the payment, but the tip is not theirs as me and my co-worker were doing the work.

I was told to not be greedy as another order had tipped me already.

Greedy because I’m entitled to the tips I receive?

I told him if it was even a quarter I appreciate anything people are willing to tip.

He laughed at me and said “You want a quarter? Here you go.” And laid it on the table for me laughing.

Once my other co-worker arrived I let her know about the situation. Showed her the order details showing the payment. She agreed that it didn’t seem right that the money wouldn’t go to us.

When telling her though and checking with another manager, the main manager that told me about the order in the morning ran to us and gave the same explanation. He's always monitoring everyone (understandable as a manager) and has even told me he watches everyone to make sure they don't talk about him, almost in a threatening way although I don't care enough to talk behind peoples backs as I would rather do it up front if I had an issue. But I see it as he doesn't want anyone else to slip up for what he does.

I told that co-worker later, that when he leaves to let another manager that I’ll name Manager2 about the order.

Manager2 was from a different location coming into help as we have been understaffed.

I was later informed by that carry-out co worker that the order was in fact in our system, and she was able to take out that money, leaving my half in the safe.

That was the first time I experienced that and I have been growing suspicious.

For the most recent time, this has just happened Saturday June the 15th I believe.

I walked into work, informed by my other co-worker the day before that there is an order that includes a big tip for me to do in the morning.

Immediately, I know that it’ll be hidden from me as on Saturday mornings that manager opens the store.

I walk in, and wait to clock in at my time. I walk over to him and ask him, what order are we working on? He proceeds to say, “What order?” In a mocking tone.

I tell him, the order the chef is working on right now.

He runs and grabs the firing ticket that shows me the food items, (not the order sheet where I can see everything in full detail)I tell him I want to see the firing sheet. He acts like he lost it and is figuring out where it went, and then runs to his office. I’m told by the chef that she just had it in front of her (possibly removed it as he saw me there a couple of minutes before my shift), implying this manager had just removed it hoping I wouldn’t ask about the details and just follow through. He hands it to me and I look at it and there is a big tip on it. I walk over to the computer pos system and check to make sure the order is there in order to be able to close out/review with the door dash driver that has been scheduled. The moment I enter the carry-out room the manager says out loud that it’s already closed out. I ask him, why would the order I’m working on be closed out if I didn’t do so yet. He explains that it is already in the system like that. I walk over to him and ask him how would I cash out on the tip that was presented. “That is not yours”

I tell him, how would it not be mine if I am the one in charge of the order in my shift.

He tells me it goes to the driver (Keep this in mind)

I tell him there’s something shady about this, first the order being hidden from me from the moment I got there and then being closed out under someone or something else.

He starts to yell “Are you questioning my integrity?” And I tell him “Your actions are making me question your integrity”

Soon he begins to get flustered and red saying “I’m going to call the district manager and have her explain it to you”

He takes me to his office and calls what I assume is the district manager.

He tells her, “Could you PLEASE tell \_\_\_\_\_\_ about the policy?”

She proceeds to tell me that the money goes to the driver, (of course but what she means is that it doesn't to the delivery driver if they're scheduled with door dash) but says it in the way that it goes into the restaurant in order to pay FOR the delivery drivers that get hired through door dash for the orders. She tells me that if I want to earn that money I should become a driver for the restaurant and apply for that.

I ask about why do people pay for delivery then and for that large sum of tip money why would that go back to the restaurant and not the actual employees working for that.

Things just seem suspicious from here, and shortly the call ends by saying I’m a great worker and thanks me for my job.

The manager grins at me, and says “We aren’t supposed to give you guys the tips for delivery drivers, it used to be like that before but we have just changed the policy.”

It’s interesting that the policy suddenly changes the moment there is a huge order with a huge tip (Past $150 dollars)

He proceeds to tell me that he was going to be nice enough and give me $40 dollars of that tip, because he is a nice guy, although like he said “He is not supposed to be giving me that money”

Because I questioned his integrity as he kept repeating, he will no longer give me a dime is what he says.

We walk out of the office and I go back to setting up the order for the delivery.

Later on in the day, he offers me the $40 again, I’m assuming because he wants me to keep my mouth shut about this issue and knows I know there’s a problem.

I decline, and continue with my day.

&amp;#x200B;

To add to his character, there is one more story.

Another issue that I would see as more of a loophole but not stealing would be with this story I have heard with another order, that had a tip of an estimated $340 dollars. (I was not here for this tip, but as I manage orders I was able to see it)

This was a huge order that would need an employee to work for, but conveniently that said employee was scheduled a different shift time than the usual. Anyone could see that this was because that manager did not want her to share in any part of the tip and wanted to do the work so that he would cash out for that otherwise I’m wondering where that money went.

When I asked this employee, she said she came in early of course to help out, but was being told they need no help as the manager would handle it entirely and would not allow her to clock in. No other carry-out was there for this order, an order of over $1500 dollars.

We usually start earlier but it’s interesting that he would schedule her later for once. I would not say this is stealing but more of taking advantage of being a manager in order to set things up for himself.

I’m not sure if a manager does an order if they are able to keep the money or what they do with it, but that’s just another story as I said.

I want to know what action I can take, how to take it, or if I’m in the wrong with this and there is nothing suspicious. I'll go ahead and provide any more details if needed. Thanks in advance to anyone! This store manager does not have the best reputation here, and even servers get upset as I've heard he has taken huge tables by himself in order to cash in the tips for himself. (makes sense you get the tips but you're a store manager and you have employees)

The only other person that I've mentioned all this too is the head chef, and she has mentioned filing with the labor union, she also agrees that he provides a negative environment. Still, I don't get why she hasn't spoken out on it, but I'll respect her and try to be the one to speak up for not just myself but for other employee's.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi legal advice reddit, I have a question regarding how tips in restaurants are handled.

&lt;p&gt;We usually start earlier but it’s interesting that he would schedule her later for once. I would not say this is stealing but more of taking advantage of being a manager in order to set things up for himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if a manager does an order if they are able to keep the money or what they do with it, but that’s just another story as I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to know what action I can take, how to take it, or if I’m in the wrong with this and there is nothing suspicious. I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and provide any more details if needed. Thanks in advance to anyone! This store manager does not have the best reputation here, and even servers get upset as I&amp;#39;ve heard he has taken huge tables by himself in order to cash in the tips for himself. (makes sense you get the tips but you&amp;#39;re a store manager and you have employees)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only other person that I&amp;#39;ve mentioned all this too is the head chef, and she has mentioned filing with the labor union, she also agrees that he provides a negative environment. Still, I don&amp;#39;t get why she hasn&amp;#39;t spoken out on it, but I&amp;#39;ll respect her and try to be the one to speak up for not just myself but for other employee&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

From January to June, I worked for a company that was essentially contracted by NYC public schools to come into the classroom and tutor kids. There were different programs being ran, and I specifically helped 6th graders with reading. 

In April, they sent a singular email in the middle of the night (literally at 1:30 am) saying that they were switching the clock in app that we were using to something else and to look out for an invite. At this time, I was off for almost a full two weeks because of my scheduled finals at school, so I didn't worry about it much, but kept a mental note to look out for an email. Obviously, the email never came, and by the time I remembered that I should have gotten an invite, I was already almost two weeks into not getting paid, but I hadn't noticed because they are a week delayed. It wasn't until the second Friday after I came back to work that I realized that something was wrong.

I texted my boss, and got no reply. Mind you, he's young, so there is absolutely no way he doesn't have his phone on him to check. I give him a day, then send a very detailed email to him, outlining what pay I missed, the days, etc. It wasn't until I sent that email and a quick text right after that I got a reply within SECONDS. I'm sure, only because it looked like I was lining up evidence to sue them. In that email, he said to look out for an invite... again, it never came. I didn't worry about it too much, because they said that they would just input my timesheet via the other app and get paid the next Friday, so I assumed they would do it again for my last week instead of sending out an invite to someone who would most likely not return to the company in the fall. 

I don't always keep track of my account because I don't do a lot of spending. At most, I'll just do small transfers to my savings account and that is it. I didn't check last week, however, something convenient about the pay system they use, is that it sends an email breakdown of your pay, taxes, etc. I checked my email and didn't receive one of those. So I decided to give them a week, since it took them a week last time. 

Yesterday, I sent another quick text to my boss, politely asking him if I would be getting paid today early in the morning. Again, no response. Fast forward to today, no email and no funds in my account. At this point, I'm fed up. I have bills due this week and have to actually dig into my savings (which won't get into my account until Tuesday, because I use a separate bank) and I'm incurring late fees because of this whole issue.

I was notified of a hearing for non-payment of rent. I have paid all of the outstanding rent and the landlord told me that I don't need to go to the hearing since I paid. They said they will forward me a confirmation that they are withdrawing, but I have not received anything official except e-mails confirming that there is no longer an issue and that they are withdrawing. The hearing is on Monday. I am concerned about miscommunications and default judgements. Should I take off work and go to the hearing? If I do not go and there is a judgement, is there still any way to stop the eviction after the fact?

I was contacted by a legal CPA office about my deceased father's unclaimed funds. I looked at the agency up, they are legitimate. They are even listed on fltreasurehunt dot gov as a registered entity. It took me a long time to just go with them. I tried claiming on my own but, was lazy about it. I figured 20% wasn't a bad price to pay to have them do it for me.

I filled out the forms, granted them power of attorney. I called after a couple of weeks to check on it and was told it could take 90 days or more. I gave them over 6 months before reaching out again when I realized so much time had passed and, I had heard nothing and they never sent me a case number to check the status.

The person I was working with, I assume is no longer there and I was forwarded to a manager, who is stating that I am trying to claim funds for the wrong person. There are about 8 accounts to claim and no doubt a few of them may be incorrect but, the CPA chose the accounts and, even left one out that I am positive is my father's and let them know in the original paperwork.

The manager who is saying that I am claiming the wrong person, sent me information that ""proves"" I am claiming the wrong person but, that is incorrect. The information they are providing is actually my father's real estate license from the brokerage company where he worked with before he passed. The address is for the company and, the home address where it is registered is not somewhere he has ever lived so, I assume it's the Brokerage company owner's residence. The manager at the CPA is claiming that is an address of another person with the same name as my father, who is still alive. My dad lived in a small town. He was well known and, though our names are common, there was nobody else there by his name.

I have checked the unclaimed funds website and, see that 7 of 8 accounts have been removed from the site, except for the one they did not want to process. The manager is being rude and has only referred me to call the unclaimed funds agency. I have asked repeatedly for the case number, so that I can check the status or, provide that information but, the manager is not addressing that request.

TLDR; I was contacted by a legitimate CPA to claim my deceased father's unclaimed accounts. I sent them the info they needed, they never responded or gave me a case number.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Background: This is happening in Portsmouth, VA, but wife and I live out of state. My wife's father was recently admitted to the hospital for late stages of liver failure due to alcoholism. He has two daughters, my wife (32) and his second daughter (20) from a second marriage. He has been living separately from his second wife for the past three years, but currently no legal separation (why he never filed for divorce is beyond me). They've been married for 15+ years. The second wife currently has a severe drug/alcohol issue and lives in Florida. He also owns his own residential construction company that has been plagued with mismanagement over the years, but as far as we know it is still profitable. We have a ""Durable General Power of Attorney"" that has my wife listed as the ""attorney-in-fact."" From reading it, it seems that it is primarily focused on have power over the business side of things. As of now there's no will, only verbal requests to leave everything to his two daughters.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Concerns: Basically, no one in the rest of the family is responsible or trustworthy besides my wife. My wife's half-sister barely gets by and that's only because she ""works"" for the construction company. She's partly to blame for the constant mismanagement of the business, although her father is really to blame as he cannot run the business side of things either. The other major fear is his second wife trying to take everything. She's stolen tens of thousands of dollars from the company before (she also ""worked"" for the company in the past) so I wouldn't be surprised she will try to take everything she can. Last concern is that my wife is in her third trimester and even though this is the last thing she needs to worry about, it's only going to get a lot busier when the baby comes.

Other information that may help: 

One other person was forced to quit due to some minor disagreements on how the kitchen should be run. This is this is my bosses' furst year and my former coworker's second year working at the camp.

There is another coworker who arrives late almost everyday and has been reported for bullying by multiple people on multiple occasions. He still works there and has been given a leadership role

We have talked to their direct higher ups, but they claimed that they could not/would not do anything

Is firing someone based on a mental health issue (That to my knowledge they were activly getting help for and did not affect their job) Legal? Should me and my coworkers push for an investigation? If so, who should we go to, since what is basically our HR department has refused to help?

As a teen I was given the option to go to the college my mother decided or be kicked out an homeless. By teen I mean this started at about 14. Due to this I ended up with around 30k USD in loan debt. I know that isn't as bad as it could be. I've got my degrees, but there's a major problem.

My spouse makes $12 per hour. My therapist and psychiatrist have labeled me as disabled due to mental illness and advised that I not be employed. Didn't stop me from trying anyway, but the illnesses caused a lot of organ failure due to the stress of working even part time. I've been effectively barred from employment, but after a 5 year battle the state of NH still refuses to grant any assistance. The judge at my hearings deemed that organ failure and blood from various orifices due to stress and mental illness is not disabling. Added in case of necessity: I've been diagnosed with Schizophrenia, Major Depressive Disorder, Major Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD.

Ok, enough background. As it is we barely make ends meet every month with what we're able to pull in from my spouse's $12/hr and whatever remote job I can grab, usually only lands me about $30 at a time. I average at about $90 per year. The state of NH has also deemed that is enough money being earned that we cannot get any type of state assistance.

My loans have been on an IBR plan since I graduated in 2016. Currently we pay nothing per month. If they ever came off of that I'd be expected to shell out about $350 per month. That would be about half our rent. We've made documents proving our expenses, and we only have about $200 in savings at the end of the month.

So having done all that and seeing the numbers, we've debated filing for bankruptcy. We don't have any assets, so we won't lose anything. Not sure if we'll go that way yet though.

For now we've decided to save up to get a meeting with a lawyer to discuss options to try to get this debt gone under the state stipulation of: Student loans can qualify under bankruptcy if it is shown repayment is an undue hardship.

We arranged for an HVAC contractor to rip out our ductwork the Friday before work was to begin so the contractors would have space to work. The foundation people said that prior to the work beginning they would reach out to let me know exactly what time I would need to be there the first day and how long the job would take.

&amp;#x200B;

They never contacted me so I reached out to them the week before the work began. They said the job was on the calendar for 6 business days but could maybe take 11 days. They started work on June 10th. It's been 20 business days now. I've had to postpone my HVAC contractors so much that they have questioned if I even still need them. I have called the foundation people multiple times to try to get updates. Every time they ask if I would like for someone to call me, I say yes, and then nobody ever calls. I finally started emailing them on June 20th. so I could have a paper trail. I asked for any updates, and tried to find out the timeline for completion. They said my crew leader would call but they never did.

&amp;#x200B;

I managed to get off work early one day and stopped by to catch them. There was one guy there digging, but they had already told me the digging had been done two weeks prior. he called the crew leader while I was there with him and still couldn't give me a clear answer for what the next steps would be.

&amp;#x200B;

I've gone out to the house about twice a week to try to figure out what they've done. The last time I went out (June 29th) I noticed a large plastic tub and tarp with dried concrete 6 inches from the roadway, huge piles of dirt under the house and I saw that they snapped off one of the water supply lines from my water heater. They had finally poured the footers at least. I took a bunch of picture and then I emailed them again on July 1st.

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned my main concerns: the concrete close to the road, the broken water supply line and the huge piles of dirt. I again asked for the timeline of work and when it would be done. They replied to say they were forwarding my email to the production team and that someone would call me to discuss the cleanup. They never mentioned removing the dirt or fixing the supply line the broke. Of course, no one called me again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really at a loss for what else to do. Calling and emailing have had seemingly no effect. They have really good reviews so I'm not sure why I'm having such a difficult time with them. It's like they refuse to communicate with me. We still owe them about 10k for the rest of the work. In addition to the 25/day no water fee. We knew about the fee in advance but we were also under the impression the job would take 6-11 days, not 20+.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess we just need to know if we have any legal recourse in this. It's probably just wishful thinking though.

Hello!  I've not been on Reddit long, nor really understand it, but created an account to ask about this.

For disclosure, I'm training as a UK and European patent attorney, so a lot US patent law (and law in general) is pretty opaque to me.

I've got a case where we've filed a Patent Term Extension (PTE) Request.  A few months later, the USPTO sent a letter to the FDA, which explicitly states that it is ""NOT to be considered as notice which may be made in the future pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 156(d)(2)(A)"".

This paragraph states the following:

""(A)Within 60 days of the submittal of an application for extension of the term of a patent under paragraph (1), the Director shall notify—

(i)

the Secretary of Agriculture if the patentclaims a drug product or a method of using or manufacturing a drug product and the drug product is subject to the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act, and

(ii)

the Secretary of Health and Human Services if the patentclaims any other drug product, a medical device, or a food additive or color additive or a method of using or manufacturing such aproduct, device, or additive and if theproduct, device, and additive are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,

of the extension application and shall submit to the Secretary who is so notified a copy of the application. Not later than 30 days after the receipt of an application from the Director, the Secretary receiving the application shall review the dates contained in the application pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) and determine the applicable regulatory review period, shall notify the Director of the determination, and shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of such determination.""

Nothing has been done by the USPTO or the FDA within the time frames set out by this section.

So my question is, when do these time periods actually start if it's not from the date the PTE request was filed?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(crosspost from &lt;a href=""/r/patentlaw""&gt;r/patentlaw&lt;/a&gt; in case I can get some luck here; hope that&amp;#39;s okay!)&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a little at a loss on what to do in this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in May, I decided to switch from ATT postpaid plan to a prepaid one. Somewhere along the lines, something got messed up. Apparently, they had been continuing to charge me for data even though the original postpaid account should have been closed. Now I have a bill of $1200 that I have no idea how to pay. I have tried contacting them since I first got notification about the bill, but I have just been getting the run around ever since then. I got a letter in the mail that I'm on my final notice and that the account would be sent to collections fairly soon. They keep telling me that the charges are valid and that there is basically no way of reversing them, so I guess I'm going to have to figure out some way of paying it even though I never got any notice or bill that I was still being charged after I switched my account to prepaid.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on increasing my credit score as of late and have been doing fairly well, getting it to almost 700. And I've heard that collections can seriously ruin that and any decent chances at a good score. I'm 23 and will be graduating college in two more years, so I don't want something major that would affect my chances in the future. I stumbled upon LendingClub while browsing CreditKarma and was wondering if a personal loan is a good route to take instead of maxing out the pair of credit cards that I do have.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23 from Georgia, I bring in about $1000 a month. I have car payments at $230 (about $7000 remaining on the loan) and a phone bill at $60. I suppose I could also use the loan to pay off my remaining credit card debt &lt;$1500 too, but I'm not really sure what is a good route to take. I bank with Wells Fargo and Navy Fed (prior military) if either of those provides better loan options.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Original Post.

I cleaned out an old account to post this... consider it a throwaway for obvious reasons.

It’s a long story, but it needs complete context…

I’m an only child. So was my cousin… my dad’s sister son, also an only child. We were about 3 months apart, and we were close friends.

The families used to get together over the Summers… they lived about 8 hours away, but there was a lake near their place, so we’d visit and go there for a few weeks every Summer holiday. The best memories of my life, without question. And also the worst, because in the Summer of 2011, he drowned. He was 15.

Nobody knows what happened. Horsing around on a raft on the lake, lots of kids and adults around, and suddenly, hey, where’s Bobby. He’s here somewhere. Looked around, nowhere to be found, maybe he swam back to shore, he’ll show up, he must be kidding, hey Bobby this isn’t funny, where the hell are you…. annoyance growing to concern growing to panic, cops called, everyone searching… and the water was pretty deep and murky, but someone deep diving (20 feet) not too far from the raft found him.

And we never really found the cause. There was no evidence he hit his head or any unusual markings or anything. He just drowned, and to say it was devastating would be a big understatement. My aunt and uncle have never been the same, and for years, they kept his room intact, as if Bobby might suddenly show up. Apparently my aunt changed the bedsheets every so often, as well as dusting and whatever else.

Obviously, the Summers at the lake ended… in fact, I didn’t see my aunt and uncle for about 5 years. My parents went and visited a few times between 2011 and 2016, but without me.

On one of those trips, I guess they convinced my aunt to start letting go… and my parents came back with a bunch of stuff that had belonged to Bobby that they thought I’d want. I used his baseball glove for a bit after mine wore out, but it felt wrong. The rest of the stuff sat untouched in our garage for years.

Last year, I had a 3.5” floppy that I wanted to get a file off… and was scratching my head because I had no PC with floppy drive. Then I remembered Bobby’s old PC had a drive… the one sitting in our garage. I’d never bothered hooking it up at home. It was older and crappier than mine, and I knew it was nothing but a bunch of games which were already 5 years out of date when the computer arrived.

But it had that drive, and if I could boot that machine, great… so I hooked it all up and turned it on and yay, it worked. I hadn’t really figured out how I was going to retrieve what I needed. I initially just wanted to see if it’d work, and it did, but the computer wasn’t even hooked up to the internet… no need. I found what I needed and screen-shot everything I needed off the floppy, but before turning it off and packing it up, I started poking around a bit to see what might be there.

The short answer is nothing exciting, except… a Bitcoin wallet. Not with a million coins or anything, and at the time, pretty much worthless. From what I can tell, they weren’t worth much back then. I really have no idea where they actually came from. I suspect from the transaction log on the wallet that he downloaded the client, ran it for a while, got bored with it eventually and forgot about it and its measly roughly 47 bitcoins. There wasn’t much else except a short note with public key/private key and a recovery phrase and a backed up wallet.dat that I actually never managed to get into, but I was afraid to connect that machine to the internet in case those coins somehow vanished… it took me a while to educate myself about it, but long story short, those bitcoins now live on my phone, password protected and 2FA protected and wallet backed up and from what I can tell, there has never been an outgoing transaction from this wallet.

So, here we are. Roughly half a million dollars. Who does it belong to? Legally, I’ve brought it up theoretically with people and it’s always an interesting discussion. Is it like finding a physical wallet with cash in it, and no ID? Is it like finding bank log-in info and swiping the cash in the account? They gave me the computer; isn’t what’s on it mine? If someone gives me a book from a used bookstore and there’s a $1 bill in it, it’s mine, right? What if it’s $100? Still mine? What if it’s $100,000?

That’s a technical, legal discussion. Feel free to weigh in. The other is the moral/ethical discussion. Is it my aunt/unlce’s? Half of it? Some of it? Nobody in this equation is in debt or lacking money. All happy middle class folk… for whom this would all be a lot of money.

At present, I’m in school not racking up any debt because my parents have agreed to pay for my education as long as I take it seriously, which I am.

So… this all just sits there, but I bring this up now because I’d be lying if I said I’d never felt guilty about it. Of course, I haven’t absconded with it, and there’s all sorts of plausible explanations why only now I mentioned it… like, hey, I just hooked up Bobby’s computer and guess what… whatever. I bring it up now because we will be with my aunt and uncle this coming week, and maybe it’s time to say something. Or not. Or what.

Feels good to write about this because I’ve never mentioned it to anyone, but at some point, this needs to see the light of day.

Back in February I applied to Chase digitally for a credit transfer and declined their offer because it was not enough to cover my entire credit card debt with Capital One.

I've spent countless hours on the phone with them trying to get it sorted out but just get scripted person after scripted person. I've finally wiggled up to their ""executive office"" where they said they were sorry and would put the transfer back to my Caption One card. The transfer amount only (no late fees) went back to my Capital One card on June 17th, but is still in my chase account as well.

Luke also let me know no late fees would be taken off my account, my minimum payment is still due on the 6th of this month and he threw in a bonus, ""Its not my fault you didn't read the letter"" jab.

I'm honestly not sure where to go from here. I was just trying to better my credit debt and now its doubled and my credit score has suffered greatly.

I’m almost a 100% certain it’s legal, so I looked it up, and it said it right there, but the shopkeeper just said he doesn’t want to risk it. &lt;/p&gt;

I think this is a little unreasonable and shady as we lived there for barely more than 1 month and nothing like this specifically was in the lease.

Location - Texas

Junior year of high school (2012) someone in my school made a fake twitter account of me and said some pretty bigoted and just nasty things on it acting as if it was me.  At the time I just brushed it off as bullies and didn’t pay any mind to it. They used my full name and everything for the profile (and it’s public). 

Well it’s one of the first things that comes up when you search my name on google. I just recently rediscovered it and since I’m applying for jobs, I feel like employers are finding it and then immediately discounting my application. 
I’ve reported it to twitter on multiple occasions and had some friends of mine report it too. 
The impersonation policy states “Impersonation is a violation of the Twitter Rules. Twitter accounts that pose as another person, brand, or organization in a confusing or deceptive manner may be permanently suspended under Twitter’s impersonation policy.” But I’ve reported the account for impersonation (even providing my driver’s license) on 3 separate occasions and twitter thinks it’s not in violation. 

Twitter also has an inactive account policy that states “We encourage people to actively log in and use Twitter when they register an account. To keep your account active, be sure to log in and Tweet at least every 6 months. Accounts may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity.” The account hasn’t been used since September 2012. On these ground alone it should be deactivated but it still stands. 

Is there anything I can do to get this taken down? I’ve tried contacting people from high school to see if they know who made it but no luck. 

TLDR; twitter won’t take down an account that bullied me 6+ years ago, think it’s impacting me getting a job.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, obligatory long-time-watcher-first-time-poster. &lt;/p&gt;

So this guy I used to go to school with and play on the football team with has my debit card and he owes me 180 dollars. This is because he told me he could make money with the money I sent him by the “cashapp process” and by placing money orders in the bank. So I trusted him because I knew him from football and school (although he did not go to my school anymore, possible expelled or dropped out). So he hasn’t paid me the money he said I would make by giving him the 180 on the card. He has some of my info and my debit card. He blocked me today and I do not know his address. However I do know his full name and the city he lives in. I also have his snapchat name and I know some of his friends. I have proof of the convo we had and a photo of his black hand holding my card. Also some of the money that was put on my debit card was spent on pizza, cashapp, Apple Music, and other shit I did not give him permission to. It’s also possible that he gave the card to someone else because he claims to not have spent that and there was another guy working with him. WE ARE BOTH UNDER 18 and living in the same town. Could I contact my bank and ask for info on the purchases I did not authorize. If I can get his address I will go there and demand him give my card back and pay me what he owes me. I will threaten to call the police when I’m there too so he can’t fuck around with it. Should I contact local cops to do an investigation or just play it out without getting legal. Or should I call my bank and get the card deleted so he can’t use it when I put money on it. Rn there is not money on my debit card so this fucker can’t steal more. 
Any advice without making me look like a dumbass in-front or my parent and police?

My wife filed a petition for dissolution last year.  I live in Canada.  She requested a restraining order and a protection order. 

There is no communal property and our finances are separate.  She wanted each party to keep the belongings over which each had control.

There are no children.

My response was that I objected to the divorce, the restraining order and protection order, and that I preferred to reach an agreement on dividing personal belongings. I no longer care about dividing belongings.  Anything of mine she has I haven't missed or wanted in the last couple of years, and she obviously didn't want any of her stuff back, so that would be a waste of time and money.  I objected to the divorce because I'm Catholic (she is now ladies) and can't morally assent to a divorce, when I belief the marriage to be valid.  I've got no illusion that this will stop the civil divorce, I just can't tick a box that says ""yes I want a divorce"".  I stated that there are no grounds for a restraining order or protection order.

In the past two years I have contacted her three times.  Once at Christmas (2018) I wrote a letter to her and her parents inviting them to stay as mic of a last ditch effort.  Spring 2018 I emailed her to say I had to vacate the apartment on which she was still a lessee; this prompted her to file for divorce.  A couple of months ago (spring 2019) I sent an email regarding a personal matter on which I felt she had a right to give input, saying ""I'm doing this if you want to have input, please contact me.""  She didn't, and I have not contacted her again.  Before that I was sending gifts, cards, trying desperately to reestablish contact.  Realized, myself and with others' advice, that that was a bad idea, and I stopped.

She has now made a motion to waive mediation.  She states a history of escalating harassment, and cites my ""deteriorating mental state"" despite having refused all contact with me for three years, the first of which I was trying to continue contact and the last two I've just described.

I will be moving to another province literally thousands of miles away in two weeks time.  The hearing for this motion is on the day the moving truck is supposed to come.  I am about to file my change of address.

My questions are:

If I simply cease to respond at this point, I understand they'll waive mediation, can I expect the divorce will simply proceed based on the petition and my response to the petition? 

Will the restraining and protection order be granted per the petition if I don't show up to trial, or will its merit be assessed by he judge?

Can a protection order cause me legal problems with things like crossing into the US?  Is it in a database?  Will it come up in an ordinary background check?  Will it come up in any kind of background check?  Could it be used to demonstrate a history of violence in some future legal matter?

My feeling at the moment is that there's nothing more I can do to save my marriage except pray for a miracle, and that fighting the divorce would if anything make a change of heart on her end all the more improbable.  If that's the case, and it won't have and real legal repercussions on me, I may as well save the money, just stop responding, and let it play out.

Quick backstory: my sister ran away October 29th with a boy. She was in her senior year of school. She snuck out, left all her stuff, and had zero contact with us ever since July 1st.

When she contacted my mom again, the only thing she said to her was this:

*I need to get my belongings, my paperwork, my money that I worked for (she worked at Panera's). Do your job as my mother and return my things to me today because this should be the most important thing on your mind.*

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is really emotional and hurt by this and ended up text arguing with her. Long story short, mom has my sister's money simply because the authorities suggested to take out the money in her bank account just in case someone did take her and tried to access her bank account.

Mom's got her last paycheck's worth + her overall savings (which totals up to 3,500) and she will give this to her.

Mom had long since donated her clothes.

As for her paperwork - mom really doesnt want to hand this over to her.

So to begin with, I want to say the divorce started off as mostly my fault. I had an affair

After it happened we agreed to try and work on things, and then she decided she wanted to have a rebound and then get with someone else. No big deal. Yes I was hurt and called and texted constantly. Emotions happen. 

Then her and her new boyfriend with whom she is now pregnant started making protective order threats, threatening to say I hit and tried to rape her and they had pics of the bruises, yada yada. No this did not happen. 

After him calling and threatening to come after me if I didn’t sign papers I decided I was over it and it was time. Trying to keep costs down we all met at a bank and had the packet she had printed up so we could sign and have it notarized. I read through it and thought it was odd there were no page numbers, but being my first divorce I didn’t think anything of it and admittedly I stupidly trusted her. It just basically said we separated the property on our own and had it settled. And both spouses waive right to alimony or child support since we had no kids. 

Property is:

Land inherited from her mother (her name)
Double wide we were gifted (her name)
Pickup truck (both names)
Camper (both names)
SUV (her name)
And a business (my name)
Loan for improvements in double wide (both names)

After the packet was signed and notarized I had the guy print off a separate copy for me. We signed and notarized that one as well.

On top of that she hasn’t taken my name off of any of the bills or loans and isn’t paying them so they are calling me asking me for money when she’s the one keeping the land. 

And on top of that she was making more money than me since the business is new and isn’t really producing much of an income yet.  Her and her new guy have been on multiple vacations since we split.

So id say 95% of the work was complete, just some very small touch ups needed for it to be finished. maybe 45 minutes of work remained after 3 full days of work done.

i text the customer saying that the work was almost complete, she replied to me saying oh no its not complete until i am completely satisfied, at which point i assured here we would take care of ANYTHING she had a problem with, that we wanted her to love the final product. she says there are spots all over that needed sanding, and that it possibly needed re stripped and completely re stained! she said that her lattice was hung upside down when we put it back up ( the lattice was perfectly square pieces, if you flip them the other way they literally look exactly the same!?!?). she said the color is not the color she picked. she had decided to go with the same color that she had but in solid color rather than transparent so we had the supplier laser color match them. ill point out she was home 2 of the 3 days and saw us staining with that color, never mentioned anything about not liking the color or not being the correct one, even offered us water.  at this point i began to feel it was a scam, or that she just wanted to get out of paying the remaining balance, however i just continued to say im sorry that you are unhappy, we will do everything to correct the things your not happy with and fulfill the contract.

so after repeating at least ten times that we would take care of it for her, she continued to argue, i then move to saying well the work is not all the way complete yet, we will fix the issues and i intend on fulfilling the contract and when it is complete i am sure she will love it . she just keeps on, starts to say even more things are wrong which i know for a fact are not!  at this point she is becoming really aggressive, and starts to say she should get a full refund ( aha! suspicions of scam confirmed).

now at this point i am tired of her aggressiveness, constant arguing after assurances we will take care of everything. this is all over text and she starts to make demands that i come meet her in person. i decline, she asked to meet before the work began and i showed up and waited for an hour and she never came home. the previous year she had us do an estimate and schedule her, then stopped responding when it was time to do the paper work, so a pattern of being stood up has been going on. i ask if she will think things over and talk with her husband, decide what she would like to do. i can fullfill the scope of work covered in the contract or i can put in a change order to halt work and we'll just call it even (im tired of dealing with her at this point). shes says yes halt the work. then i think to myself, i dont want to halt the work and put in a change order 95% is already complete so she owes us around 500 bucks. i explicitly say; ok just double checking, you would like us to halt work and not complete the legally binding contract, she replies ""yes that is correct"".

so my question is do you think this is an easily won small claims case? ive had someone do something similar years ago and i just took the loss, i did not want them running around saying bad things about the company ( we have 100% positive feedback and reviews on facebook and google). to be honest im tired of these few rich people thinking they can treat people any way they want, we are a very small business, i try to employ people that are in recovery from drug addicition (only clean ones) or have felonies on their record so they have somewhere to work that doesn't judge them. we work hard, we work under the sun in extreme heat but most importantly we do a good job and do not stop until the customer is satisfied. i would like to take her to small claims, maybe put a lein on here home.

if this is a good case what should i seek for damages? i was thinking 551.00 (95% of the 580) but now im beginning to think maybe i should add on some money for the 3 days she delayed us because she wouldnt tell us a color to use, we could have been working else where but i dont like to have 2 contracts running at the same time in case issues come up with one.

thanks for reading all this and for any help you may offer!

&lt;p&gt;so after repeating at least ten times that we would take care of it for her, she continued to argue, i then move to saying well the work is not all the way complete yet, we will fix the issues and i intend on fulfilling the contract and when it is complete i am sure she will love it . she just keeps on, starts to say even more things are wrong which i know for a fact are not!  at this point she is becoming really aggressive, and starts to say she should get a full refund ( aha! suspicions of scam confirmed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now at this point i am tired of her aggressiveness, constant arguing after assurances we will take care of everything. this is all over text and she starts to make demands that i come meet her in person. i decline, she asked to meet before the work began and i showed up and waited for an hour and she never came home. the previous year she had us do an estimate and schedule her, then stopped responding when it was time to do the paper work, so a pattern of being stood up has been going on. i ask if she will think things over and talk with her husband, decide what she would like to do. i can fullfill the scope of work covered in the contract or i can put in a change order to halt work and we&amp;#39;ll just call it even (im tired of dealing with her at this point). shes says yes halt the work. then i think to myself, i dont want to halt the work and put in a change order 95% is already complete so she owes us around 500 bucks. i explicitly say; ok just double checking, you would like us to halt work and not complete the legally binding contract, she replies &amp;quot;yes that is correct&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so my question is do you think this is an easily won small claims case? ive had someone do something similar years ago and i just took the loss, i did not want them running around saying bad things about the company ( we have 100% positive feedback and reviews on facebook and google). to be honest im tired of these few rich people thinking they can treat people any way they want, we are a very small business, i try to employ people that are in recovery from drug addicition (only clean ones) or have felonies on their record so they have somewhere to work that doesn&amp;#39;t judge them. we work hard, we work under the sun in extreme heat but most importantly we do a good job and do not stop until the customer is satisfied. i would like to take her to small claims, maybe put a lein on here home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if this is a good case what should i seek for damages? i was thinking 551.00 (95% of the 580) but now im beginning to think maybe i should add on some money for the 3 days she delayed us because she wouldnt tell us a color to use, we could have been working else where but i dont like to have 2 contracts running at the same time in case issues come up with one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thanks for reading all this and for any help you may offer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I AM LICENSED INSURED AND EVERYTHING IS LEGITIMATE AND BY THE BOOK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TDLR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;customer waited till 95% percent of work was done, made a bunch of false claims of issues and problems with the work, then asked to back out and for the contract to not be complete. good small claims case? what should i seek in damages, she owed 580 if completed, but delayed us 3 days, because she wouldnt tell us a color.&lt;/p&gt;

My girlfriend and I are leaving our apartment before our lease termination, which the building/leasing office agreed to. They have told us that they are telling prospective tenants that our unit is available after our move-out date, but they have refused to put it on their website.

&amp;#x200B;

We've heard that landlords are required to mitigate tenants damages by making reasonable efforts to sign new tenants. We're wondering if their refusal to put our unit on the website would be considered not making a reasonable enough effort to lease our unit? We know San Francisco has many tenant friendly regulations, and has a strong tenants union, so we're hoping that gives us some leverage.

&amp;#x200B;

(Massachusetts)On July 1st, I was interrupted on my way to drop my rent check off for July by a call from my girlfriend that it was raining in our apartment.

I rushed home and helped move some furniture out of the way, but about half of the (PLASTER) ceiling is saturated, and the 100+ year old wood floors were already buckling. We didn't lose anything, except maybe the couch, but that doesn't matter it was cheap anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

We had to call the police to come break into the basement to turn the water off, as our landlord locks it and doesn't leave a key anywhere.

The landlord called a restoration company to come dry the place off. They showed up on the 2nd and the boss had to basically pry payment out of her. They said that they'd set up dehumidifiers and floor driers, and would see what the ceiling looked like above before committing to putting air ducts up to blow dry air in. She refused to let them touch the unit above us (which is vacant), which has even MORE water damage than ours. Apparently she thinks pointing a fan at the wall will turn the plaster back into a solid and make the paint magically stick again.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out this wasn't the first time this has happened, and the last time, it wasn't remedied properly. There's mold  in the ceiling, in the plaster, in the wood lashing, etc. The company put up a plastic barrier and left, they'd have to come back to fix it another day. They left the floor driers and dehumidifiers running.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I get an angry email from the landlord about how the ""company already charged me SO MUCH, but they now want to go back and charge me MORE to take down the SUPERIOR QUALITY ceiling and put in crap quality new ones."" She then mentioned how we had already been ""so upset about the leak"" (Just concerned about mold), and I'm almost positive she sees the charge from the restoration company as directly our fault. (If we weren't there ""complaining"" about it, she could have fixed it herself with a roll of paper towels and a fan, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't think she is going to have the mold remedied the right way. She assured me that she'd have her ""handyman"" go spritz it with some bleach, and there would be no problem.

I'd rather not gamble on my health. This landlord is crazy (this isn't even the beginning, I have several examples).My girlfriend and I just want to get out of here.

&amp;#x200B;

We already packed up all of our stuff and moved it to the garage, and we are living in the kitchen (the only room with a separate door from where the water leaked). I have already done research on ""implied warranty of habitability"", and things like that, but I'm no expert on this and would really love some guidance.

The boss from the restoration company seems equally baffled why the landlord wouldn't fix it properly, and said he will be having her sign some kind of agreement that she realizes the job isn't complete, and the risks, etc. Getting a copy of that seems like it'd be a good way to get out of here.

The company was supposed to return today to get their equipment, but they needed the landlord to be there to sign the waiver. Apparently they can't get ahold of her... All she seems to care about now is getting me to pay July's rent. She's sent me multiple messages already. I haven't replied to anything of hers, I feel like I need to be careful with my words.

In April of 2017 I filed for a no fault divorce. My ex complied with his end of the paperwork and we waited the 90 days. Unfortunately, the Affidavit of Consent/Waiver of Notice was dated incorrectly (I believe we both had to sign within 30 days and it went over). During that time, my ex decided to leave the country and go back to his place of birth. He was a legal permanent resident here, citizen there (UK).

During the past two years I have had the Affidavit of Consent/Waiver of Notice re-issued three times and all three times my ex has failed to sign. The lawyer I have been filing through only handles No Fault divorces so he does not believe that he can help me because the refusal to sign is essentially contesting the divorce.

My ex and I were unable to maintain speaking terms and I have/had him blocked on all social media. We have not physically seen each other for well over two years. We are not currently on speaking terms at all. We do not share anything in regards to property or possessions. We have no children. Aside from being legally married there is absolutely nothing that binds us together.

I suppose my question (before I meet with my new lawyer and look like an idiot) is: Will I have to petition for divorce again? If I do, will there be a waiting period? I don’t believe he will sign anything that comes to him or fight me in court. He is refusing to sign simply because he ‘will do it when he feels like it’. 

How much more difficult will it be to obtain a divorce now that he does not reside in the United States?

HOA sent contractors to remove the damaged material but basically ghosted me after that. it has been months of going back and forth with the HOA and just today I got a certificate from the water remediation contractor that the room was cleaned properly. 

The HOA has stated they are only responsible for drywall but I want compensation for the damage they caused. they tore up my floor in the affected bedroom and left it in that state, and have been dragging their feet to do the bare minimum.

Do I have any recourse, and can I make my HOA compensate me for the floor? This issue has been going on for 4 months now since I initiated contact with my HOA management company. 

Also as a side note: I tried to file an insurance claim and it was rejected. The policy did not cover “seepage” which was determined to be the cause of loss.

&lt;p&gt;The HOA has stated they are only responsible for drywall but I want compensation for the damage they caused. they tore up my floor in the affected bedroom and left it in that state, and have been dragging their feet to do the bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I have any recourse, and can I make my HOA compensate me for the floor? This issue has been going on for 4 months now since I initiated contact with my HOA management company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also as a side note: I tried to file an insurance claim and it was rejected. The policy did not cover “seepage” which was determined to be the cause of loss. I was a first time buyer and I feel really crappy about my purchase and I don’t really know anything about what I can do. Just feel like I’ve been getting the runaround from everyone for months now. Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

I particularly have been looking for good land close to us since my parents are retiring at the end of the year and moving back here to be close to the grand kids.

New land goes up on the market, roughly 7 acres, beautiful location. We tell our realtor about it and get her to take a drive with us out there. We tell her we intend to put an offer on the land. She says everything looks pretty good, she'll contact them and get back to us.

She has been reliable in the past on 2 separate deals. Ok, now a couple days go past and we call her brokerage, leave a message. No response.

I am patient, and I know land doesn't often sell as fast, but we really like this place so I decide I am going to contact their agent myself directly. I pull up the listing and boom, listing is off the market. I call the agent and I find out someone made a cash offer on the land and they accepted and it got pulled.

This agent completely and 100% ghosted us, never got back. I said screw it, didn't lose too much sleep over it, but it annoyed me. I wasn't going to use her again at least.

So, as I occasionally am looking at properties in the area I do a little looking into the property we lost, out of curiosity who bought it, and I find out that it was purchased by my real-estate agent that ghosted me. WTF - pretty livid over this!

I’m in the state of California. Me and my girlfriend originally rented a duplex for a 6 months at a rate of $2,300/month.

From the get go my landlord requested a $3,000 deposit. When I asked why so high her response was “it’s a freshly remodeled home.” After some minor back and forth we decided to go ahead with the lease and paid the deposit.

Upon moving into the duplex it became very obvious to us that it was not ready to move in. There were loose ends here and there that we overlooked for the most part. 

From there things went downhill rather quickly. We ended up having contractors at our duplex almost every week doing some form of construction. It started to feel like we were living in a construction zone. We were forced to move our vehicles from our parking spaces to make way for 10 contractors to do maintenance on our driveway, etc. Our laundry room fell faulty and they rigged up a hose to dump the laundry detergeant into our yard which ultimately killed everything it touched. That went on for weeks. Needless to say I started to truly feel the incompetency of my landlord and her lack of consideration. 

Fast forward to now and she’s been super adamant to get us to sign a new lease. I told her we’d have to have a long discussion before doing so which we did. I explained to her on the phone all of everything that happened in the last 6 months and told her I wasn’t interested in signing a year lease if it meant I had to continue living in a construction zone and having there lack of dealing with our issues. Her BIG solution was to offer us a 9 month lease. My gf wanted us to sign away but something in my gut told me something was off. My landlord even told me that she “couldn’t guarantee there wouldn’t be more major construction going down on the property in the future.” 

I finally reached out to my neighbor below us who I never talk to and she confirmed my suspicions. They had it way worse than we did during our lease on account of their place being flooded during a pipe burst. She quickly advised me not to sign a lease and also informed me that our landlord was trying to blame all of the damage on her and take it out of her $3,000 deposit. This definitely got my attention.

So I think me and gf both agree it’s time to kick rocks out of this place and go month to month so we can get a new place. However, I’m now extremely paranoid that I’ve basically got involved with a savvy scam artist. I believe my landlord had us set up from the beginning to scheme our deposit when we move out. It’s important to note that we never did any sort of official walk-through of the property and me and my gf have taken very good care of the place and there are hardly no damages from us.

My question is how do I go forward with this? I feel like she’s going to find a way to take my deposit. I know it isn’t exactly legal to use it as last months rent but a part of me feels like that may be a better way. I’d rather lose the last $700 then be out of $3,000. I’m worried though that she could have grounds to basically sue us for the last months rent and still find a way to scheme us out of our deposit.

The other route of course would be to play by the rules, pay our last months rent, and then sue her for the deposit back if she indeed schemes us. I’m just not super savvy on Ca. State law when it comes to these situations and thought I’d first get some sound advice before moving forward.

If she did indeed take our deposit without real grounds to do so, what would the process be to get her into litigation to seek it back?  
 

I’m obviously trying to avoid any court to solve this problem, but then again I feel like I’m in a trap and better get myself prepared to deal with this. $3,000 is a lot of money to us and I have to do everything in my power to ensure we get that back.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m in the state of California.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a situation I've never experienced in my \[27M\] past 5 years as an insurance agent so I appreciate any advice or guidance in this matter! I work for a well-known insurance agency that is based here in the United States (NYS in particular) and I have a client that is threatening to sue myself, my boss, and probably the company as well if he could. This client is 74 years old and while the usual threat of a law suit never scares me, this guy has a history of suing businesses over the past couple decades, although thankfully he appears to have lost every case.

&amp;#x200B;

  This client, prior to coming to our agency, was involved in 5 (yes, five separate) hit-while-parked hit and run accidents, where his van was hit on five separate occasions in random parking lots. The weird part is that all 5 of these claims occur over a 6-month period... Not too many people I know have their vehicle hit on 5 separate occasions by a mysterious hit and run circumstance in such a short period of time...

Anyways, you probably guessed what happened next - he has now filed his first insurance claim with our agency for (yet another) hit-while-parked accident, bringing his grand total to 6 claims in the prior 5 years. He called our agency service team and is furious that he does not have rental reimbursement coverage (the coverage that pays for a rental car in the event of an accident) on his policy to pay for the 8 days he was paying for a rental and claims that I specifically told him that rental coverage was on the policy. 

Spoiler alert: We have the signed application at policy-inception showing there was no rental coverage and I specifically remember him telling me he didn't want it to keep the cost down. The good news is that I have the signed paperwork indicating there is no rental coverage as well as this renewal paperwork still showing there is no rental coverage, so I don't think he has much of a case in terms of an E/O exposure on our company.

Long story short - he came in to our agency the other day and spoke with my boss (who told him we would not pay for his rental coverage because he chose not to have it) and the client was furious and left in a fit of rage threatening to sue my boss, myself, and the company. The ironic part is that it is probably cheaper to pay for his rental car bill than it is to sue my agency (then again this guy appears to be a lawsuit chaser).

&amp;#x200B;

My question is - is it possible for him to actually sue me as an insurance agent directly? He claims I was being ""malicious"" by leaving rental coverage off of his policy (which again makes no sense because I get paid more commission for writing more premium). Would I be protected by my insurance agency's lawyers in this circumstance? Thank you for any advice you can give me regarding this situation, I greatly appreciate it!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

The ironic part is that it is probably cheaper to pay for his rental car bill than it is to sue my agency (then again this guy appears to be a lawsuit chaser).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is - is it possible for him to actually sue me as an insurance agent directly? He claims I was being &amp;quot;malicious&amp;quot; by leaving rental coverage off of his policy (which again makes no sense because I get paid more commission for writing more premium). Would I be protected by my insurance agency&amp;#39;s lawyers in this circumstance? Thank you for any advice you can give me regarding this situation, I greatly appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;

My lease is set up to end on August 1 this year.  When I signed to the lease, I had to pay last month rent.  I paid it last year and I have a record of it.  Now, I go onto my payment portfolio on  July 1 and see there is nothing to pay.  This was common because my roommates have a credit and it is a joint rent.  The office was closed and I just decided to be safe rather than sorry and paid normal rent.  Well, I get to thinking and call the office the next day and she says last month's rent was collected last year.  So essentially, I paid rent when I didn't need to.  I asked if I can have it back because I'm in a tight spot right now and they said they would only return it with my security deposit.... which won't be returned until at least September.



There's no way this is legal.  What do I do? 



I requested it back on phone and via text, certified mail probably would not be worth my time.  I said ""my overpayment of rent is not a security deposit and I am requesting that you return it immediately"" but got no response LOL

&amp;#x200B;

Dated someone for a short amount of time. Clearly told them I no longer wanted to see them. They kept showing up to and driving past my house. I told a mutual friend who told him to stop coming to my house. He kept coming and I've had to call the police several times, at this point I have a restraining order against him. His main ""thing"" when trying to constantly find me or contact me is to convince me that I'm wrong about him and that he doesn't want me back , just for me to acknowledge he wasn't stalking me, he's obsessed with proving this. Which is crazy because if he had just stopped showing up weeks ago no one would have ever even known, we don't work together, i don't know his family, it would have just gone away.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I got served with papers in small claim court. I'm being sued for defamation of character. Specifically when I told that friend that he had been stalking me. He's suing me for legal fees related to the restraining order as well as therapy he's had to get for what these claims have done to him.  He's claiming we were still in a relationship at the time and that he had no idea he didn't want me to come over. The whole thing is bananas but I still have to go to court. I honestly feel like this is just another way to finally see me in person though which sucks. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do here? I assume there's no way not to go to court and see him. I obviously have the restraining order as well as footage from cameras I had to place around my property showing him showing up multiple times after I officially told him in written form to stop coming to my property. Can I bring all this to small claims? I have a lawyer (which is costing me a ton already) so I'm in decent hands but I rather use him as little as possible and I guess I can't go into small claims with him anyways, plus I won't get to talk to him till after the 4th and this is stressing me out so here I am.

We signed a month-to-month agreement giving a security deposit and first and last months rent. We are originally from CT and are just up here temporarily for work.We originally thought we were only going to be there 3 months but the house were were purchasing wasn't closing as fast as we thought it would. It is now the middle of May and we learn we can move into our house by the June 1st. One of two landlords is outside gardening and my partner has a conversation with them about leaving. He asks to leave in the next weeks/by June 1st but if that is not an option we will be leaving by July 1st. Meaning, our last months rent we gave at signing would be applied to June. She said she would have to get back to us after talking to the other landlord but otherwise leaving by July 1st didn't seem like a problem. 

We didn't hear back from them about leaving early (we thought it was a stretch anyway) so we were left thinking that July 1st was the set move out by date. On June 2nd, my partner gets a call asking why wasn't rent paid and we said it was with last months rent. She claims that the notice we gave her was not proper and that we would have to stay another month (July). She stated she was going to call her lawyer and the police. My partner communicated to me, when I started to do research about my rights. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the tax assessors office and the home doesn't even have the basement listed as finished, let alone as an in law. 

It is a raised ranch with an in-law apartment in the basement. It is a one bedroom apartment with only one door to exit the apartment. You have to go through three doors just to get outside. 

The contract says that they will not pay interest, but I am pretty sure it is the law.

I didn't receive a receipt from what bank my last month's rent was deposited.

I did not receive a statement of condition.  

&amp;#x200B;

Timeline

February 1: Move in date. A few days before we signed the lease and gave first, last and security deposit. 

May 14: We talk to the landlord about leaving by June 1st if not July 1st. She said she would have to get back to us about      -------------June 1st but made it seem like July 1st was an okay date to move out by.

June 2: Phone call from landlord stating we were living there for free and she was going to call cops and her lawyer. Tried being civil and saying okay well can we pay you for  1/2 days in July to smooth this over. She said that they have financial obligations they have to take care of and we can't just not give proper notice.

June 3: I do research and go to the tax assessors office where there is no record of this apartment. Tax assessors say they will be paying her a visit once I vacate. I communicate with them and she says to me, "" Your partner didn't say that you would be leaving, ""he"" said he was moving out because he can't stand to be with you anymore."" ....we just bought a house... At this point I explain the situation about the contract being written against my rights as a tenant as well are her apartment not being legitimant  as far as the town was concerned. She said so you'll be out by the First of July and I said yes and that I expect my security deposit and interest upon leaving.

June 30: Up until this point they have been ignoring us at all costs. We clean the entire place (cleaner than when we moved in)  and once everything is moved and clean we leave and put the keys under their front matt. 

I wanted to give them the weekend to enjoy their holiday (and enjoy mine without thinking about it) and then call them Monday telling them the address to send the check.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be prepared for the phone call so I can face any personal attacks with a sense of confidence because I will have some knowledge. Please let me know what to do?

It was a basic ""hey how are you doing"". Beyond that, he added his contact info and name into her phone without her knowing it.

My concern is that he had access to private information, private photos, and bank info while her phone was in his possession and hooked up to the store computer while he was trying to troubleshoot her phone issues.

She&amp;#39;s a customer there and the Assistant Store Manager flirted with her the three hours she was there, not a huge deal. 
He then added her on Facebook, curious, but also not a huge deal. And then texted her the next day without consent or giving him her phone number outside of a professional setting. It was a basic &amp;quot;hey how are you doing&amp;quot;. Beyond that, he added his contact info and name into her phone without her knowing it. Surely it cannot be okay to add his contact into her phone without her knowledge or consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My concern is that he had access to private information, private photos, and bank info while her phone was in his possession and hooked up to the store computer while he was trying to troubleshoot her phone issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I found out we called a nearby store to reach out to a district manager to discuss the issue, as I was pretty irate. They took our information but did not reach out.

 [San Bernardino, Ca]

My step dad and sister have been arguing for a couple weeks now I think. 

My step sister let’s call her Sam and my step dad let’s call him John.

Some background 

Sam has 3 children, a single mother who stays at my johns house. John recently bought the house last year. He is hardly home and comes home on the weekends when he can.

John recently brought home his mother after being with relatives because she was accusing my dad of not doing enough after johns dad past. Which is not true because he paid for his funeral and did everything he could to be there for her. 

Johns mother let’s call her Abby.  John, Sam and Abby stayed at an old house Which was sold. 
When it was sold drama erupted because some  relatives wanted some money . Abby decided to leave and  the relatives inherited the money. While John who does everything was left with nothing.

John brings back Abby into his new house. After abby was screwed over by the relatives and was only given a 1/4 of the money .  Abby gives about 100k to John to keep or save I don’t know.

Now Sam, my step sister was upset because John took away a car he bought her because she has 3 kids. To take them to school and what not. 

Sam doesn’t have a job she isn’t determined to get one she stays home and smokes weed. She takes the kids late to school, takes kids late to gymnastics or acting classes John pays for them. 

Sam also totaled  johns just paid off truck. And before that totaled a car he bought for her around 2016. And was recently rear ended in the new car he bought her again. 

My step dad John  is a good hard working man I look up to him. And I’ve never heard anything bad about him other than the stories he told me himself when we was in a gang as a youth. He has a record but since then turned his life around. 

So for my step sister Sam to accuse him of being a pedophile and so much other shit. He is scared he is going to lose everything. 

Sam was trying to put everyone against John even the neighbors! Last night 4th of July. The neighbors even speak highly of him. Always invites them to bbqs and so on. 


I know how a bat shit crazy woman who think she’s entitled to everything can fuck up a mans whole life by falsely accusing him of being a pedophile. 

Sam wants the money so she could burn it so fast. And that’s what John doesn’t want to happen. He thinks he deserves it, I think he does.  He doesn’t want his lowlife daughter to spend it partying and what not. 



What can  my stepdad do to protect himself and the house and money? 


Sorry it’s all over the place just a shit show of a post.

Last time I was working and the drawer was short, he wouldn’t let me leave until my coworker and I gave him $5 to cover the drawer. Recently, my coworker also told me that when the drawer is short, he’ll just take the full amount out of each of our paychecks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m getting really uncomfortable about the fact that he takes money from us, and it feels wrong. Please help!&lt;/p&gt;

I got a speeding ticket in Defiance county, OH on the 3rd for doing 11 over.  The state trooper that got me told me the court date was in a week, on the 12th.

Two questions:

1.  I am not in the habit of getting speeding tickets, but isn't having a week between ticket and trial a bit... fast?  I thought the process took more like a month.

2.  I just started a new job, so I don't get paid until the 16th.  What do I do to set up a payment arrangement? Just call the court? I live a few hours away, so showing up isn't exactly feasible.  Do traffic players take payment arrangements? Do they generally require payment before, or after court?

Also, the fine amount isn't on the ticket, and I cannot find it on the court's website.  Any ideas on how much I owe?

Our family's beagle was found dead in his crate at PetSmart a few weeks ago while were away on a family vacation. We've dropped him off there many times before and he's always loved it. He was  9 years old, in very good health, and had no apparent health issues when we dropped him off. He had infrequent episodes of seizures but that is common in beagles. Only 2 days after we left we got the call that something happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, about 3 weeks later, we just got a preliminary report from the autopsy that he died of pneumonia. Our vet told us this could happen very quick if exposed to the bacteria. The bacteria, forget the name, is usually found around horses. We do not live nor have ever walked him in an area with horses. We believe it is feasible that a different dog could have brought this into the boarding area at PetSmart but regardless our beagle should have shown some signs or symptoms of illness right? PetSmart has stated they have someone watching the dogs 24/7.

&amp;#x200B;

So we're obviously still waiting for the full report but is there a case here? My family isn't as quick to lay blame which I respect, but this REALLY came out of left field. Like I feel that his death was caused by an unsanitary environment which could have been prevented by perhaps more competent staff right?? Maybe I'm getting too emotional about it but does this sound like PetSmart is responsible?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location: California&lt;/p&gt;

5. She has a home and cars that she wants to protect. 

6. He lost his job recently and probably has no money to protect - so we think it’s going to get ugly. 


How can she protect her assets in this stage when nothing has been filed ?  Can she “gift” / “donate” that money to us for “investment” purposes (we have a legit reason)?  Can she put a good chunk of that money in a 529 plan (college savings ) for her kids?

I won't name any names, yet

My gf was hired as a manager to look after the dogs at a new store opening in August. Before that she was going to have to fly to Florida for special manager training coming into and she knew that. The day was coming and she was ready untill she was mauled by a pitbull the door before she flies out.


It was a normal day at her work and she had said dog out in it's play area.  There a bunch of fenced in areas where they can all play individually. She was in one literally only scratching the dogs ass  and it was enjoying it. Then another dog ran out and this dog saw it through the fence and growled wanting to get to that dog but it couldn't so it of course turned around real quick and starting mauling my girlfriend. I've got pictures if needed.

So she goes to an urgent care they do their shit and her arms are wrapped up like a mummy. And she still has to fly out the next day. And she does. Because she is a fucking warrior and a trooper. Fast forward and one for the days she has to work a 14 hour day as soon as she's down there. She's crying every night. Luckily her parents lived down there and were there to help as well.

Well she gets back and is off for 5 days finally. She rests and when she gets back to work they let her work 2 days( which is today by the way) before they pull her into the office. This morning she was late because there was an issue with the car. She had only in the almost two months working here had any other issue and it was a flat tire.  They tell her they she is getting demoted, because apparently in Florida she was 'frustrated' and 'wasnt taking it seriously' while she was training in Florida. I mean it was over 100 degrees she had to wear cloth bandages over her fucking mauled arms. From dog that shouldn't have been there because it had bitten someone before and she had no prior knowledge to this they did not tell her. On top of that they said she didn't have reliable transportation when she has only missed one day due to sickness, she made it to work after we got a new tired on the car previsouly and had to fix it this morning too.

I've always understood MAP to be a ""take it or leave it"" policy. In other words, I've always understood MAP to be a policy where if you don't follow it, you can be terminated as a dealer. I didn't think dealers could be sued (successfully) for not following it.

Also, I understood MAP to only be in effect while the dealership was active. I didn't think they could hold you to MAP after being terminated (when it didn't specifically give guidance with regards to MAP after a dealership was terminated).

EDIT: We did show them countless violations by other dealers before and after being sued. They didn't care about the others. They rarely enforced MAP, unless it was really bad. In fact, they truly didn't terminate us for a MAP violation, it was for selling a competitor's product. They just cited MAP as an excuse for termination after being challenged. And actually, the product they cited was one that they ""unofficially"" told us was OK to advertise below MAP a few months earlier.

After termination, they gave us 56 days to sell thru existing inventory and refused to take anything back for a refund. They demanded any unsold product after 56 days to never be advertised or even sold...ever. That was when we dropped pricing on everything to get rid of the gear ASAP.

We’ve had a plumber/handyman working at our house on a couple things over a few days. He really took a liking to our dogs and would bring treats for them and play with them in the backyard.

He removed a bunch of carpet and left it in the garage to pick up later. It was a couple days after the work was done that he came by to pick up the carpet. He had our garage code as he had done work while we weren’t there before but on this particular day there was no reason for him come inside our actual house. He texted my wife to ask if he could visit the dogs while he waited for his crew and she said yes. We weren’t home so we aren’t 100% sure what happened but our dogs got out and ran up the street and our youngest dog attacked an unleashed dog that was in our neighbors yard. Thankfully the neighbor’s dog did make it but his vet bills totaled $6000. This has been devastating for us as dog lovers and as members of this community and we are horrified at the whole situation. We reimbursed our neighbor for the vet bill immediately and made the difficult decision to rehome our beloved pet. This entire situation is still difficult to talk about but the further we get from it we are like wondering if the plumber holds any liability for $6000.

From her position of ""Power"" as she described it to other friends, she would perform several actions that I can not condone, that I disavow, and that I find require legal action. But I am unsure how to get that action. For now, I'm just going to bring up one of the things. For the sake of privacy and the reader's time.

The Discord server was widely varied in its userbase. This woman began to hate a guy I'll call N. So she illegally obtained the dox of him and a 12-year-old little girl. She used this dox to... I would say extort... the girl under duress to send her nudes to a fake account that looked like N's. Then she screenshotted it, cropped it so you couldn't see anything, and tried to use those screenshots to label N a pedophile. She then, as she told me, attempted to get his GF to leave him, his university to suspend him, and the police to arrest him. Luckily she failed, but she still in my mind harmed a child and one of the people I saw as my best friend.

What do I even fucking do about this?

I just bought a house with what I thought was a very nice backyard, but after looking into installing a fence (for my dog) it seems that the legal property line is wildly different from the areas that were maintained by the previous homeowner based on natural boundaries. Obviously the town wont likely approve a fence outside my property line, I'm just curious about what my options are depending on how zealous I am about pursuing this. Here are some pertinent details:

1. The area that I thought was my property based on natural boundaries and past owner maintenance is actually part of an adjacent cemetery.
2. The area in question is not at all near any graves, furthermore there is an impassible barrier of trees and ivy between this area and the grave sites (see image: [https://imgur.com/GS7Wgu6](https://imgur.com/GS7Wgu6)).
3. Finding a way to extend a fence through this area would be highly beneficial because it increases the usable backyard area by 25%-ish.
4. Location: Monroe County, NY, USA

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that out of the way, I have some questions:

1. Is there any scenario where I can legally build a fence on this area without purchasing that piece of property? Like with some legal agreement between me and the cemetery owner (perhaps involving compensation)?
2. If the above won't work, what are possible steps towards collaborating with the cemetery owner to perhaps subdivide and purchase the area in question? Surveyor, attorney, government fees, etc. The area would otherwise be wasted space if it is excluded by a fence, and I am prepared to offer fair compensation.
3. How do I go about finding the owner of the cemetery? I have the cemetery parcel's New York ""Tax ID"", but the online deed records don't go back far enough to have any documents, and the tax records don't have a name (perhaps because cemeteries are tax free?). The most recent gravestone has a 1910 death date, and it appears to be a family cemetery (someone cuts the grass, don't know who).

(If this is the wrong sub for this I apologize.  I'm pretty stressed and searching didn't show anything more applicable so here I am....)

I got pulled over tonight in the car I bought from a dealership late last year for expired registration.  I have every paper in my glove box from my past 3 vehicles and their insurance, etc (no joke, it's stupid and I need to declutter that and be less paranoid about needing ancient paperwork), but do you think I could find my registration tonight?  Of course not, and that's on me.  But at the time of purchase (less than a year ago) the dealership took care of (or so I thought) the registration along with the title stuff.  I never received a renewal notice in the mail like I usually do, and by my calculations I shouldn't have expected to for a few months.  Registration has always been yearly.

So I check the paperwork from when I bought the car and they lumped the title and registration fees into one cost.  By checking my states DMV and related websites, I found that what they charged adds up to a year of registration plus the title fees.  I'm going to try to straighten this out tomorrow (today?  It was late driving home.), but I was wondering if anyone out there had any insight about why a vehicle would be registered for less than a year by the dealership anyway, especially if they're going to (seemingly?) charge for a whole year.  The way I see it, either I made an error somewhere, the dealership made an error, or the dealership is overcharging in their fees knowingly and are at least somewhat misleading about it, at least from where I'm standing now.  I fully own that I could have screwed something up, but if that's the case it's just not obvious to me at the moment.  I've never heard of registrations being for anything less than a year, so that's why I didn't ask about that at the time of purchase.

I checked my status with the DMV online and it says the same thing the officer told me.  I'm not young, I've never missed a renewal, inspection, etc ever.  I've never gotten so much as a speeding or parking ticket and I've been driving for decades, so you can maybe understand my stress and confusion here.

Also, I only have 10 days to figure it out and plead guilty or not guilty, and three of them are the weekend after the 4th of the July so.....yeah.  Any advice/shared knowledge would be really, really appreciated.  Thank you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got more information from the DMV and talked to someone at a title place as well, then went to the magistrates office.  The person at the desk asked if I wanted to plead guilty or not guilty, and I said I wasn&amp;#39;t sure yet.  I briefly explained my situation and she told me what to plead despite big signs saying that staff cannot give legal advice.  I guess my question now changes to opinions on the likelihood of this being dismissed.  I renewed within hours of finding out it was expired and the info I gathered from the DMV shows a fairly clear error on their part.&lt;/p&gt;

So happy news! I called again today taking a chance they might be open. Turns out they were. A wonderful women dug into to my account. Turns out EVERYTHING I been told before was a flat out lie. This infuriates me but I'm also happy that it will be an easy resolution. It seems like they hired some new employees. I took sometime on the phone going over my notes from previous calls explaining to her what I was told. (She can also see notes on her side from my previous calls). I didnt want to take up too much of her time asking why I was told these things and I doubt she would have an answer anyways. 

As for the credit, once the arrears clears I can file a dispute with my credit agency and it should be taken off. The woman that I spoke knows the person who processes credit disputes in the office. She is going to give her a heads up so she knows what is going on. 

Lastly, I did get the name of the woman I spoke to in case there is any other problems. 


For those interested here are the lies and correct information. 


Lie #1: My arrears was way higher than what it actually is. 

Resolution: In Feburary I was told I had to pay over $1000 to get out of arrears. I knew this total was impossible and they could not adequately explain it. Only an additional $30 is taken out each month for arrears. My total arrears I'm paying today is $350. 

Lie #2: My payment will always be late due to when my employer paid.

Resolution: My payment from the 1st is counting for the current month. They usually receive it around the 5th. It's not late until the end of the month. I think previously they were telling me that my payment for the 1st was for the previous month. Its July and they already received my July payment. I do not owe June, it was already paid. Just my arrears from when the account was initially set up. 

Lie #3: You can't carry a credit on your account

Resolution: You absolutely can. However, since my pay is steady through the Army this won't be an issue and it was recommend against putting a credit on because of that.

I began paying child support for my son in November. Because of the time it takes to get started I was delinquent on a month and a half. When I called to fix it, I was in arrears and they told me to let the arrears take care of the deliquency.  I'm in the military and live out of state from the agency which is in Ohio. I wanted to get it fixed so I called again and wanted to pay my deliquency plus 1 month ahead because depending on DFAS (military pay) it could be late again putting me into arrears again. They told me that I could pay but the account will not carry a credit. So if I pay extra, it's just extra and doesn't count to the next month. They also told me that it would be impossible for me to get out of arrears now because of how DFAS pays in connection with dates the state wants the payment. DFAS which also pays civilian government employees (millions of people) won't and can't do anything to help. State law states I HAVE to pay through my employer, I can't just make the payment on my own. Today I discovered my credit score is quickly dropping because of this.

I called my attorney on the divorce and child custody and they don't handle it. They told me other lawyers will not get involved because there is nothing they can do. Also I pay state tax I should receive back due to being in the military that I won't receive due to arrears that I will never be able to clear.  I need help. If you have any experience I would greatly appreciate it. I'm not trying to get out of paying child support. I'm trying to fix it but the agency is making it impossible. I've called several times talking for several hours and gotten no where. 

(Though it shouldn't matter, for reference I am a female that left an abusive marriage. My ex had a better lawyer and I moved out of the state so the proceedings favored my ex. There is a lot more to this but I don't feel like its revelant. We share full parental custody but I have less parenting time hence the child support). 

Child support is being paid in Ohio.

&amp;#x200B;

 We recently gave our 30-day notice for terminating our lease on a month-to-month tenancy. Our landlord sent us a message today asking us to make sure that our house is spotless and in the same condition it was delivered to us by the end of the 30 days, and confidently promised to charge us for each day that the unit is unoccupied after our lease expires while the place undergoes necessary cleaning/repairs. This seems absurd to me for the following reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I understand correctly, California law allows normal wear and tear without penalizing tenants after a tenancy ends. We have been here for over a year, and naturally there are wear-and-tear marks on the house (e.g. scuff marks from shoes on a wooden floor, hard-to-remove bits of grease residue on stove, etc.). Therefore, it is bizarre that he is asking for the place in mint condition given that it had just been renovated when we arrived.
2. If what the landlord is threatening is legally defensible, it would seem to imply that a landlord could simply claim that every day that a unit isn't rented was the result of the previous tenants' minor wear and tear to a house. 
3. Even if a unit were absolutely trashed, the landlord's claim implies the landlord could delay cleaning for months and continue charging the previous tenant simply because the trash delayed the signing of new tenants onto a new lease for months. 

If our landlord determines that we have damaged or trashed the unit (which we do not believe we have or will do), isn't the landlord's legal recourse to deduct the cost of the repairs/cleaning itself from our security deposit, and not this weird extra rent for each day the house remains damaged/trashed? 

It seems to me that the only amount we are obligated to pay is that of the cost of cleaning or repairs **beyond normal wear/tear,** and not the rent that would be owed for the number of days that the unit remains in a worse condition than how it was received by us over a year ago. Is this correct?

We have been here for over a year, and naturally there are wear-and-tear marks on the house (e.g. scuff marks from shoes on a wooden floor, hard-to-remove bits of grease residue on stove, etc.). Therefore, it is bizarre that he is asking for the place in mint condition given that it had just been renovated when we arrived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If what the landlord is threatening is legally defensible, it would seem to imply that a landlord could simply claim that every day that a unit isn&amp;#39;t rented was the result of the previous tenants&amp;#39; minor wear and tear to a house. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if a unit were absolutely trashed, the landlord&amp;#39;s claim implies the landlord could delay cleaning for months and continue charging the previous tenant simply because the trash delayed the signing of new tenants onto a new lease for months. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our landlord determines that we have damaged or trashed the unit (which we do not believe we have or will do), isn&amp;#39;t the landlord&amp;#39;s legal recourse to deduct the cost of the repairs/cleaning itself from our security deposit, and not this weird extra rent for each day the house remains damaged/trashed? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the only amount we are obligated to pay is that of the cost of cleaning or repairs &lt;strong&gt;beyond normal wear/tear,&lt;/strong&gt; and not the rent that would be owed for the number of days that the unit remains in a worse condition than how it was received by us over a year ago. Is this correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, I moved into a house with a friend and his friend. 

His friend and I started dating, turned out to not be very nice, but we're all named on the tenancy. Tenancy expires in November.

I feel very stuck. I've asked them to get a new housemate to replace me, they said no. I asked them to break the tenancy altogether (something the landlord has offered to us already) and they said no. 

I can't just leave as I'd still be liable for my 1/3 of the rent.

&lt;p&gt;At the moment I&amp;#39;m sleeping on a friend&amp;#39;s sofa. I don&amp;#39;t feel safe to be in the house. I&amp;#39;m really not sure what to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone suggest a legal and fair escape route? Also don&amp;#39;t want it to be the case where I&amp;#39;m making them both homeless all of a sudden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend now refuses to discuss the matter and is completely ignoring me. His friend, the one I dated, refuses to talk without everything blowing up and it turning into a huge argument, often leading to violence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suffer with mental health issues if that changes any level of help I can get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need to be out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any suggestions&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway. I made a post awhile back about my current legal situation. Basically I got pulled over for driving with a “tag light” out. And was told to do a field sobriety. I hadn’t been drinking or anything so I agreed. They told me I failed. I was taken to the station and blew 0.0 and they are also trying to charge me with a felony for an empty thc cartridge that was stuck under my seat. 

I was trying to get home and I suffer from short term memory loss stemming from brain damage and PTSD and I was coming home from a friends to just go to sleep. 

I refused the urinalysis at the police station so they cannot prove I was intoxicated and I really wasn’t! They claimed I crashed my car into the curb when I didn’t; I pulled over because I got startled and was wondering why I was being pulled over. 

After further questioning I plead the 5th. Their first offer was 6 months jail 2 years probation. I need to get the DUI dropped because this would be my second one and I own and run a company and can’t be outta work.

I have medical records showing I have short term memory loss and multiple other things from the hospital as well.

This morning, I went to meet a client that that I’ve been talking to for a few days. The son was 8 years old. He was very quiet and was messily eating his breakfast. He didn’t speak a word to me and I thought he was very shy. 

The mom just told me that I would have to look after the house and feed him. And she told me the hours I had to work and I gave an hourly rate. She was doing a tour of everything and showed me his room. When I was in there I noticed a box of diapers in the corner, one diaper on the dresser and a box of wipes. I got a little concerned and asked her about it. I thought she would just say the diaper is only because of nightly bed wetting. Turns out her son has autism, he is not really verbal and not potty trained. I told her that I charge more when I have to give that much care. She got angry and said she was going to report me to the website. And that it’s illegal and discriminatory to charge her more for her sons disability. 

My usual rate is cheaper than most. I only do older children that I basically just have to be in the room with. I do homework and study for classes for majority of the time. I’ve only had like 4-5 special needs clients and they required more care so I charge more. The other parents were upfront about the child’s needs and what my duties were (diapers, hitting, spitting, bitting, cleanups, constant monitoring)  She never mentioned her son being special needs since we’ve been talking that’s why I told her the cheaper price.

She also threatened to report me to the board of nursing, even though I didn’t get hired as a CNA. I recently got my CNA, the only reason she even knows about it is because this morning as we were chatting over coffee, she had asked me about my life/college/nursing major. I just mentioned it.

Is what I did illegal? Can I be reported for something that doesn’t have anything to do with my CNA?

&lt;p&gt;My brother&amp;#39;s phone was robbed, he had an S10, we did have insurance but we now have a $275 copay. The kids refuse to admit they ever stole his phone or give it back to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would I go about getting either his phone back or reimbursed? Is this a small-claims court? Do I need a lawyer or does a public defender work? Do I sue his parents or him?? Thank you so much, I have always lurked here but now I am in the situation I need help on what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

He never actually disclosed to me my diagnosis, but proceeded to medicate me based on his experience. I actually asked him several times if he would tell me my diagnosis, but he would only tell me that I had a form of chemical imbalance. I had some blood work done and I don't know if he could tell by that, but it was specifically to check if my prolactin levels were high due to a medication I was on.

This is where things start to get weird.

He prescribed me an antipsychotic called Vraylar, which, if you know anything about, is very expensive. He gave me free samples. This is why I felt as though I had to stay with him.

In addition to this, he accused me of being a ""junkie"" because I self medicate with marijuana, something I have always been honest and open with him about. I have severe somatic symptoms like migraines and symptoms of IBS, and the weed really just... helps. I dont want to be on a narcotic pain medication, because they're addictive. I told him this. I have never asked to be on any kind of narcotic, in fact, I actively told him that I DIDN'T want to be on them. 

In addition to this, I am transgender. Once I turned 18 I asked him if he could diagnose me with gender dysphoria, because at that point I had been dressing like a man, went by a male name, and used he/him pronouns. I was out and proud. I wanted to start HRT (testosterone). He refused to diagnose me with gender dysphoria, saying, ""I've never done that before. You must go see a sex therapist.""

I'm a psychology major, so I know a few things about the differences between therapists and psychologists. Therapists can't actually diagnose you with anything, you need to see a psychologist or a psychiatrist. It seemed odd that he would lie to me. 

I felt very sad, so I just let it go and decided not to talk to him about it anymore because he seemed annoyed with me when I brought it up. This is when he began to treat me differently.

At first, he was extremely kind. Telling me that I was worthy of life and even giving me a hug. After I told him I was trans, however, he began to treat me differently.

He continued to dead name and misgender me for the next two years, even though I made it clear to him that I am transgender.

When I asked to be diagnosed and start HRT, he accused me of being a ""drug addict"" once again. He became angry and belligerent.

In our last meeting, I was very upset. I came in crying. He continued to dead name and misgender me even though I corrected him. I will admit, I got a little defensive when he started asking why I was so upset because I felt like I was overreacting. My father had just had a stroke, and I was running out of money fast. I was in a really bad place. When he began making assumptions about me, like that I'm not taking my meds correctly (I am and was), that I'm not cooperating, that I'm ""taking out my issues on him"", and that I didn't want to get better.

This really bothered me. I told him not to make assumptions about me considering he only sees me like once every 3 months for 15 minutes. He got very angry when I said this. He told me that I was insulting him. I wasn't. He then asked to speak to my mother, which I obliged to. At this point, I was having a panic attack. He then started saying stuff like how I should find another psychiatrist because ""obviously"" I wasnt cut out for him.

He made rude remarks like asking my mother ""Does SHE always act like this at home?"", literally while I was having a panic attack. He told me I was being melodramatic, that I was a manipulative and abusive person.

Honestly, I dont know what to make of all of this. It's painful to think about and it's painful to consider he might be treating other patients like this.

If anyone has any advice on what I should do, please respond.

Anyone who still has the Fitbits now has the right to keep them, as Fitbit either didn&amp;#39;t want to deal with the negative PR or didn&amp;#39;t want to deal with thousands of used Fitbit returns.  &lt;/p&gt;

I graduated from a public high school in Texas this June. My school has a program where I can get my associates degree by taking classes at the local community college and getting my tuition reimbursed if I pass the class. My mom paid $1100 out of her own pocket and I got a ""D"" in one of the classes, but I still got credit for the class because a ""D"" is passing.

When I went in to get my diploma they had a hold for $158 on it (the price of the one class at the community college). In past semesters they sent me a check for $500, or however much the classes I took that semester cost. They have not sent this check yet. The counslers (who I have had problems with in the past) said that it is because their new system has the school pay the tuition instead of the parents instead of the parents. So, failing a class would result in me owing then $158. Also, they never had the students or parents sign anything agreeing to the ""free associates degree"" that they advertise. The whole thing has worked for a few semesters, but I took more classes this semester than any of the other ones and I still got credit for them all. I would be fine paying $158, and only getting about $950, but getting $1100 and not having to pay then anything would be ideal.

$1100 may not seem like a lot, but it is a pretty significant amount to my family. They are very invested in my academic success. So my questions are:

Is a lawsuit a viable option to getting some of this money back?

Are there methods I can pursue to get my money back without talking to a lawyer?

I won't go into the specifics of the law suit but here is some background:


We are suing our partner for just over 2 million. The case is over 7 years old and the law suit started nearly 3 years ago. The store was sold and, although the property is owned on the deed by both partners, only the defendant has been receiving rent - denying us our share. There are many more terrible offenses, including stealing, fraud, and witness harassment that are more important to the case but not important to explaining why I've lost trust in my lawyer.



Here are some of the reasons:



He is CONSTANTLY procrastinating until the very last day (and even the morning of) until I literally have to push him and/or do the work for him to get a motion on the table or to make progress in the case. I literally woke up 4:00 AM the morning of the trial to have out exhibit list in binders in the proper order because he was ""too sleepy"" at 6:00 PM the night before and never got it done beforehand. I was literally still scrambling to get the list in order in four binders while in the benches before the trail was supposed to start, having been delayed because he forgot the bylaws in the office and had to go get them.



Since day one our attorney promised to have the rent that was being paid to the defendant frozen into an escrow account until the case is over - it has been 3 years with little to no effort in passing this obvious motion with both partners being on the property deed.



He literally waited until the last week to ask for a deposition of the defendant - THEN waited until the night before said deposition to start calling court reporters (all of which were busy). The deposition failed because of this.



During the failed deposition he went to a separate room with the defendant's attorney and agreed to do ""a voluntary"" if the defendant's attorney agreed to ""accept service"" should a motion to continue be denied.



The motion to continue was denied by the judge - but the judge expressed that he was very upset because NONE of the attorneys wrote him a litigation brief. And none of them were ""conducting litigation in the way it is supposed to be conducted.""



I denied the voluntary because I had enough of this case, but in a back room with the judge and attorney they somehow agreed to a continuance.



The continuance is for four more months and my attorney has not made the motions he agreed he would make the next day which included freezing the rent in escrow, having the defendant pay the outstanding real estate taxes from the rent before the business is lost in delinquent taxes, and issuing a subpoena to the bank for essential records.


It is impossible to get a hold of the attorney because he NEVER answers his phone and doesn't want to talk until he wants to start asking for money.



I'm out of my mind doing our attorney's job for him alongside my day job and still getting nowhere.



I'd like to ask you all here, am I a paranoid asshole? How much of this is reasonable and, if so, how badly do I need a new attorney? Can I change my attorney now? What process do I need to go through? Aside from word of mouth or taking a gamble on the bar are there ways to find honest attorneys? I fully understand that he may be an exception rather than the norm, but he is the only lawyer I've really dealt with and it is a painful experience.



Thank you for reading all the way through - I'm stressed out because I've tried to make this case so easy, and it seems so simple with the amount of condemning paperwork I've provided, but I feel my lawyer is working against me rather than with me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t make these accusations lightly, so I want to flesh out what things my lawyer has done that make me untrusting of his motives and methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t go into the specifics of the law suit but here is some background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are suing our partner for just over 2 million. The case is over 7 years old and the law suit started nearly 3 years ago. The store was sold and, although the property is owned on the deed by both partners, only the defendant has been receiving rent - denying us our share. There are many more terrible offenses, including stealing, fraud, and witness harassment that are more important to the case but not important to explaining why I&amp;#39;ve lost trust in my lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is CONSTANTLY procrastinating until the very last day (and even the morning of) until I literally have to push him and/or do the work for him to get a motion on the table or to make progress in the case. I literally woke up 4:00 AM the morning of the trial to have out exhibit list in binders in the proper order because he was &amp;quot;too sleepy&amp;quot; at 6:00 PM the night before and never got it done beforehand. I was literally still scrambling to get the list in order in four binders while in the benches before the trail was supposed to start, having been delayed because he forgot the bylaws in the office and had to go get them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since day one our attorney promised to have the rent that was being paid to the defendant frozen into an escrow account until the case is over - it has been 3 years with little to no effort in passing this obvious motion with both partners being on the property deed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He literally waited until the last week to ask for a deposition of the defendant - THEN waited until the night before said deposition to start calling court reporters (all of which were busy). The deposition failed because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the failed deposition he went to a separate room with the defendant&amp;#39;s attorney and agreed to do &amp;quot;a voluntary&amp;quot; if the defendant&amp;#39;s attorney agreed to &amp;quot;accept service&amp;quot; should a motion to continue be denied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motion to continue was denied by the judge - but the judge expressed that he was very upset because NONE of the attorneys wrote him a litigation brief. And none of them were &amp;quot;conducting litigation in the way it is supposed to be conducted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I denied the voluntary because I had enough of this case, but in a back room with the judge and attorney they somehow agreed to a continuance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuance is for four more months and my attorney has not made the motions he agreed he would make the next day which included freezing the rent in escrow, having the defendant pay the outstanding real estate taxes from the rent before the business is lost in delinquent taxes, and issuing a subpoena to the bank for essential records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to get a hold of the attorney because he NEVER answers his phone and doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk until he wants to start asking for money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m out of my mind doing our attorney&amp;#39;s job for him alongside my day job and still getting nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
