So, I own a condo in South Carolina that I like to AirBnB for some extra income when it’s not being used. Recently, I rented the condo out to a family of 3. Dad and mom were around 45 and daughter was 18. 

As a kind gesture, I typically get the cleaning people to set out a bottle of wine with a note for the incoming guests. In 2+ years of doing this, I’ve never had a problem with doing so. Until now. 

I got a call from the dad, infuriated, 2 nights ago. The dad told me that his daughter took the wine from off the counter and took liquor out of my hidden liquor cabinet to drink with friends. Turns out she doesn’t quite know her limits, and she about drank herself into a coma. 

Daughter had to take a trip to the hospital where she had her stomach pumped and was treated for other complications from the alcohol. 

So dad tells me on the phone that he would like compensation from ME for the medical bills from his daughter’s mistakes. He stated that I was responsible for it by putting out alcohol. He said that if I don’t agree to do so, he will sue me for it.

I think this claim is absurd. Yes, I put out alcohol, but I thought it was pretty understood that only people *of age* should be drinking it. I would’ve understood if the wine was left on the bed of the kids room, but it was on the kitchen counter with a note addressing the parents.

While I think the claims have no ground, the laws might disagree. I need to know: can I get in trouble for this? What do I need to do if so?

Edit: Thanks for the helpful replies everyone. Many of you are suggesting that I file a police report for the stolen liquor. I learned today that this isn’t an option as renters are allowed to use all consumables in an AirBnB regardless of where they are. At this point, I’m not going to mess with the missing liquor. I’m just trying to avoid a lawsuit at all costs. If that means losing a bottle of nice liquor, that’s fine.

Also, I’ll be sure to update you guys as this situation progresses.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, I’ve got a bit of a weird one.&lt;/p&gt;

About 4 months ago, my company's largest competitor in a different country (but with overlap into our region) has posted a job opening for my exact position and credentials, but with 5x the pay (slightly over market value).

The problem is my current company had me sign a fairly standard non-compete, non-disclosure agreement which mentions not working for competitors 'for the duration of this contract'. I'm having a hard time understanding the legalese in the contract so am wondering how binding non-competes are and whether it's worth the risk? Is there an online (reputable) service where I can ask someone to look at my contract for this limitation for a small fee?

If I apply, the company would obviously know I'd worked for one of their competitors, would this be an automatic rejection? The job requires prior knowledge of our exact industry and it's a pretty small pool, so I'm curious how else I would achieve this experience without having worked for a competitor. Should I tell them I may have a non-compete/non-disclosure?

New land goes up on the market, roughly 7 acres, beautiful location. We tell our realtor about it and get her to take a drive with us out there. We tell her we intend to put an offer on the land. She says everything looks pretty good, she'll contact them and get back to us.

I am patient, and I know land doesn't often sell as fast, but we really like this place so I decide I am going to contact their agent myself directly. I pull up the listing and boom, listing is off the market. I call the agent and I find out someone made a cash offer on the land and they accepted and it got pulled.

A few months back, I woke up to cops outside my apartment calling my phone, telling me my motorcycle was pushed over. I went outside and sure enough, it was purposely pushed over by somebody and on its way down scraped the car in the next parking spot. 

The cops logged this as criminal mischief with no suspect, and that was that. The car owner took my number but I didn't hear back for a couple weeks. When he did decide to call me, he told me his insurance wouldn't cover it and he wanted me to pay. I asked him for his insurance info first and when I called the company, they said there was never any indication they wouldn't pay, and he specifically opted out of insurance coverage. 


I text him about this and he responded, saying he didn't want to pay the deductible because it wasn't worth it, and wanted me to pay instead. His quote was about $900. I don't have that money, nor do I feel it's my responsibility to pay. As a friend said it-'if somebody stole your baseball bat and beat somebody else with it, you wouldn't be charged with assault just because it was your bat.' 
However, I do want to double check where I am here because he texts me often saying he's going to take me to court and escalate this and blah blah.

On my first day of work, I asked my coworkers how breaks work and they laughed and said we don't get breaks.

&lt;p&gt;Also, if any of these things are illegal, what steps should I take to stop it?&lt;/p&gt;

 I previously posted here about my roommates who are a couple (26f) &amp;amp; (18f) who constantly fight to the point where holes have been smashed into walls, bruises appear on each of them the next day, the yelling is so loud I’m honestly shocked my neighbors haven’t called the cops on us yet. 

In that post I went into detail about how my I’m basically being held hostage because my apartment community wouldn’t let me out of the lease unless I had a police report. I called the police who advised they could not make a report unless a victim comes forward and I was not considered a victim in situations where they were being physically violent to each other.  One of them would have to come forward and we’ll, they’re dating so that isn’t going to happen.


 Today at approx. 2:00pm after a heated text conversation about my not wanting to live with my two other roommates due to their constant arguing, damage to property and theft of my own property, the 18f year old ran from a neighbors apartment where she &amp;amp; her 26f year gf (they are both my roommates)had been hanging out. She runs out and slammed a hole into my bedroom window... all because I THREATENED to call the police on her gf for providing alcohol to a minor if they wouldn’t agree to let me out of this lease. So. She. Smashed.my.window. 
Shattered glass ALL over my puppy’s home. Luckily, I had a blanket cover his cage so he is fine....

After breaking my window, she then ran to the front door, rushed into our home and put her hands on both me and a visitor (24m)I had over. We both pushed her off of us.. (18f is also 5’11 and weight about 240lbs.. she a big girl) and retreated to my bedroom. I was in fear for my safety and immediately called 911. When The officers arrived they gave zero shits about the destruction to my window. They only offered only to issue EVERYONE with assault charges and stated we could dispute it in court. Apparently 18f stayed my visitor had hit her in the face which is absolutely false. 

I repeatedly begged “but my window!?” “I have blood on my chest and scratches!” 

He told me there was nothing he could do about the window because he it was 18f’s window also. What!? I literally was on the advised by 911 dispatch to get away from them as they yelled and screamed at me in the house but some how I am not a victim because they stated they weren’t there!? 
 Is this legal!?



I have a clean record and risking a assault charge was in no way an option for me. I did, however, after crying like a baby about how these apartments won’t release me because I am the only one with income in the house therefor my two shitty roommates do not have proof of income to show they can sustain this apartment themselves. 

After crying and explains all this to police officer finally a second officer gave me his card with a police report # attached. He stated it would be a small report about everything that transpired, including their false statements of me and my guest attacking 18f. I’m planning on taking this the leasing manager first thing tomorrow morning at office opening.

My question is... previously everyone on here advised me to call the police every time a incident with my roommates occurred. But with what happened today... I feel like I almost caused myself more harm than good by almost getting an assault charge. 

TLDR; roommates are abusive, steal from me and I’m trying to get out of my lease but my apartment won’t let me without a police report. One of them smashed my window open and I called the cops, cops said all they could do is issue everyone assault charges since they were here to see what happened. How do I get out of this lease if this is the result when the cops are called and did the police really do all that they could have? 18f wasn’t even given a breathalyzer and I had told them my other 26f roommate feeds her alcohol as a desperate attempt to get something documented for me to get out of this lease","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, this one is a long one-

TLDR at the bottom!*

When we first met 3 years ago, my SO was working on a book about his experiences in a niche field of work but couldn't find a good writer for the job.

As a writer myself I offered to write it - plus 3 more mini ebooks - as well as design the cover, format it (with an app, nothing crazy), find sales channels, market it, etc. Basically, I agreed to do everything because it made me happy. I wasn't great at marketing it but it has sold $2k+ in gross profit regardless, which is not a lot, I know, but it means that I personally earned over $1000.

I know this because I have access to, and keep track of, our sales channels.

When we first self-published it, we agreed that the money we earned would just stay in my SO's business account as a ""rainy day"" or vacation fund. We also agreed in a text that it was a 50-50 split for all gross revenue - that has been the only written agreement but it's been a verbal agreement as well. We also agreed to my name being on the cover along with his name to further claim my involvement, and I am officially listed as the co-author on all our sales channels.

Eventually I became a stay at home mother with zero income. Money got VERY TIGHT. I remembered my 50% portion and realized it would actually wipe out all my credit card debt and then I wouldn't have to worry about that, at least.

When I asked my SO about taking out my portion, he said it was all gone - almost laughing, as if I should've already known this. He used all our gross revenue to pay bills without my knowledge, all of which I did not consent to. He never once asked me if I was ok with this usage of the money, he just went ahead and used all the revenue in any way he saw fit.

The reason I didn't know about this right away: I had set up his business S-Corp account on the book sales channels thinking it would be used strictly for collecting our profit but apparently he uses that for personal checking purposes, too. So the money got mixed in with that, was never separate from his own finances, etc. This means that my half of the money has gone to a number of extremely expensive monthly payments, and a car lease of his that's $1400/month.

I am furious. Weirdly, so is he - he thinks I should be ok with not seeing a dime of this money since it helps ""pay for my life."" He's not wrong, it helps, but I never got to consent to HOW it would help us. He justifies a lot of this in pointing out that he gave me a credit card tied to his accounts - but I am only to use this for necessities like groceries, so it's not really the same thing as having money to do with what you wish. Plus, I can't use that card to pay off my own credit card - my original intent.

I have $20 in my bank account and my SO knows this. I am looking for work but it's even tougher with a baby, and that money could've really helped me since our finances are separate and my SO does not invite me to make any financial decisions, budgets, etc. (clearly)

**My question: Is this considered theft? Can I sue my SO for essentially failing to pay me for my work?**

We are unmarried so maybe that actually simplifies it - it was a project with an agreement and I just didn't get paid. My SO claims I'm getting ""paid"" by staying home and not working, and being ""provided for.""

I mean... I guess I kind of understand? It still doesn't sit well with me.

I'm organizing my exit from this mess of a relationship but I don't know what kind of law this falls under since a child is now involved. I've thought about getting an IP lawyer to help sort it out but maybe family law would be needed too? I also don't have any money, obviously, so I'm at a loss.

Oddly enough, my SO was recorded in an assets separation case against his ex-wife in a deposition as saying that I wrote the books and that half of the money goes to me. My name being on the book was discussed, too, as well as the fact that it implies my 50% ownership in these book projects.

That only further cements the fact that he blatantly violated our simple 50-50 agreement, correct? I can prove with bank statements that zero money has ever gone to me, I have the text saying it's supposed to be 50-50 as well as my texts to him about being concerned that I would not see my half of the money, etcetera.

Thank you for any advice.

**TL;DR: I did a ton of writing work for my SO and I never saw my half of the profit. SO justifies this in saying that it all goes toward bills that pay for my living expenses since money is really tight right now, but I never consented to or agreed to this arrangement.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit - title got a little funky, can&amp;#39;t change it.

&lt;p&gt;The reason I didn&amp;#39;t know about this right away: I had set up his business S-Corp account on the book sales channels thinking it would be used strictly for collecting our profit but apparently he uses that for personal checking purposes, too. So the money got mixed in with that, was never separate from his own finances, etc. This means that my half of the money has gone to a number of extremely expensive monthly payments, and a car lease of his that&amp;#39;s $1400/month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am furious. Weirdly, so is he - he thinks I should be ok with not seeing a dime of this money since it helps &amp;quot;pay for my life.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s not wrong, it helps, but I never got to consent to HOW it would help us. He justifies a lot of this in pointing out that he gave me a credit card tied to his accounts - but I am only to use this for necessities like groceries, so it&amp;#39;s not really the same thing as having money to do with what you wish. Plus, I can&amp;#39;t use that card to pay off my own credit card - my original intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have $20 in my bank account and my SO knows this. I am looking for work but it&amp;#39;s even tougher with a baby, and that money could&amp;#39;ve really helped me since our finances are separate and my SO does not invite me to make any financial decisions, budgets, etc. (clearly)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My question: Is this considered theft? Can I sue my SO for essentially failing to pay me for my work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are unmarried so maybe that actually simplifies it - it was a project with an agreement and I just didn&amp;#39;t get paid. My SO claims I&amp;#39;m getting &amp;quot;paid&amp;quot; by staying home and not working, and being &amp;quot;provided for.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean... I guess I kind of understand? It still doesn&amp;#39;t sit well with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m organizing my exit from this mess of a relationship but I don&amp;#39;t know what kind of law this falls under since a child is now involved. I&amp;#39;ve thought about getting an IP lawyer to help sort it out but maybe family law would be needed too? I also don&amp;#39;t have any money, obviously, so I&amp;#39;m at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, my SO was recorded in an assets separation case against his ex-wife in a deposition as saying that I wrote the books and that half of the money goes to me. My name being on the book was discussed, too, as well as the fact that it implies my 50% ownership in these book projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That only further cements the fact that he blatantly violated our simple 50-50 agreement, correct? I can prove with bank statements that zero money has ever gone to me, I have the text saying it&amp;#39;s supposed to be 50-50 as well as my texts to him about being concerned that I would not see my half of the money, etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: I did a ton of writing work for my SO and I never saw my half of the profit. SO justifies this in saying that it all goes toward bills that pay for my living expenses since money is really tight right now, but I never consented to or agreed to this arrangement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So happy news! I called again today taking a chance they might be open. Turns out they were. A wonderful women dug into to my account. Turns out EVERYTHING I been told before was a flat out lie. This infuriates me but I'm also happy that it will be an easy resolution. It seems like they hired some new employees. I took sometime on the phone going over my notes from previous calls explaining to her what I was told. (She can also see notes on her side from my previous calls). I didnt want to take up too much of her time asking why I was told these things and I doubt she would have an answer anyways. 

As for the credit, once the arrears clears I can file a dispute with my credit agency and it should be taken off. The woman that I spoke knows the person who processes credit disputes in the office. She is going to give her a heads up so she knows what is going on. 

Lastly, I did get the name of the woman I spoke to in case there is any other problems. 


For those interested here are the lies and correct information. 


Lie #1: My arrears was way higher than what it actually is. 

Resolution: In Feburary I was told I had to pay over $1000 to get out of arrears. I knew this total was impossible and they could not adequately explain it. Only an additional $30 is taken out each month for arrears. My total arrears I'm paying today is $350. 

Lie #2: My payment will always be late due to when my employer paid.

Resolution: My payment from the 1st is counting for the current month. They usually receive it around the 5th. It's not late until the end of the month. I think previously they were telling me that my payment for the 1st was for the previous month. Its July and they already received my July payment. I do not owe June, it was already paid. Just my arrears from when the account was initially set up. 

Lie #3: You can't carry a credit on your account

Resolution: You absolutely can. However, since my pay is steady through the Army this won't be an issue and it was recommend against putting a credit on because of that.

I began paying child support for my son in November. Because of the time it takes to get started I was delinquent on a month and a half. When I called to fix it, I was in arrears and they told me to let the arrears take care of the deliquency.  I'm in the military and live out of state from the agency which is in Ohio. I wanted to get it fixed so I called again and wanted to pay my deliquency plus 1 month ahead because depending on DFAS (military pay) it could be late again putting me into arrears again. They told me that I could pay but the account will not carry a credit. So if I pay extra, it's just extra and doesn't count to the next month. They also told me that it would be impossible for me to get out of arrears now because of how DFAS pays in connection with dates the state wants the payment. DFAS which also pays civilian government employees (millions of people) won't and can't do anything to help. State law states I HAVE to pay through my employer, I can't just make the payment on my own. Today I discovered my credit score is quickly dropping because of this.

I called my attorney on the divorce and child custody and they don't handle it. They told me other lawyers will not get involved because there is nothing they can do. Also I pay state tax I should receive back due to being in the military that I won't receive due to arrears that I will never be able to clear.  I need help. If you have any experience I would greatly appreciate it. I'm not trying to get out of paying child support. I'm trying to fix it but the agency is making it impossible. I've called several times talking for several hours and gotten no where. 

(Though it shouldn't matter, for reference I am a female that left an abusive marriage. My ex had a better lawyer and I moved out of the state so the proceedings favored my ex. There is a lot more to this but I don't feel like its revelant. We share full parental custody but I have less parenting time hence the child support).

Dated someone for a short amount of time. Clearly told them I no longer wanted to see them. They kept showing up to and driving past my house. I told a mutual friend who told him to stop coming to my house. He kept coming and I've had to call the police several times, at this point I have a restraining order against him. His main ""thing"" when trying to constantly find me or contact me is to convince me that I'm wrong about him and that he doesn't want me back , just for me to acknowledge he wasn't stalking me, he's obsessed with proving this. Which is crazy because if he had just stopped showing up weeks ago no one would have ever even known, we don't work together, i don't know his family, it would have just gone away.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I got served with papers in small claim court. I'm being sued for defamation of character. Specifically when I told that friend that he had been stalking me. He's suing me for legal fees related to the restraining order as well as therapy he's had to get for what these claims have done to him.  He's claiming we were still in a relationship at the time and that he had no idea he didn't want me to come over. The whole thing is bananas but I still have to go to court. I honestly feel like this is just another way to finally see me in person though which sucks. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do here? I assume there's no way not to go to court and see him. I obviously have the restraining order as well as footage from cameras I had to place around my property showing him showing up multiple times after I officially told him in written form to stop coming to my property. Can I bring all this to small claims? I have a lawyer (which is costing me a ton already) so I'm in decent hands but I rather use him as little as possible and I guess I can't go into small claims with him anyways, plus I won't get to talk to him till after the 4th and this is stressing me out so here I am.

I won't go into the specifics of the law suit but here is some background:


We are suing our partner for just over 2 million. The case is over 7 years old and the law suit started nearly 3 years ago. The store was sold and, although the property is owned on the deed by both partners, only the defendant has been receiving rent - denying us our share. There are many more terrible offenses, including stealing, fraud, and witness harassment that are more important to the case but not important to explaining why I've lost trust in my lawyer.



Here are some of the reasons:



He is CONSTANTLY procrastinating until the very last day (and even the morning of) until I literally have to push him and/or do the work for him to get a motion on the table or to make progress in the case. I literally woke up 4:00 AM the morning of the trial to have out exhibit list in binders in the proper order because he was ""too sleepy"" at 6:00 PM the night before and never got it done beforehand. I was literally still scrambling to get the list in order in four binders while in the benches before the trail was supposed to start, having been delayed because he forgot the bylaws in the office and had to go get them.



Since day one our attorney promised to have the rent that was being paid to the defendant frozen into an escrow account until the case is over - it has been 3 years with little to no effort in passing this obvious motion with both partners being on the property deed.



He literally waited until the last week to ask for a deposition of the defendant - THEN waited until the night before said deposition to start calling court reporters (all of which were busy). The deposition failed because of this.



During the failed deposition he went to a separate room with the defendant's attorney and agreed to do ""a voluntary"" if the defendant's attorney agreed to ""accept service"" should a motion to continue be denied.



The motion to continue was denied by the judge - but the judge expressed that he was very upset because NONE of the attorneys wrote him a litigation brief. And none of them were ""conducting litigation in the way it is supposed to be conducted.""



I denied the voluntary because I had enough of this case, but in a back room with the judge and attorney they somehow agreed to a continuance.



The continuance is for four more months and my attorney has not made the motions he agreed he would make the next day which included freezing the rent in escrow, having the defendant pay the outstanding real estate taxes from the rent before the business is lost in delinquent taxes, and issuing a subpoena to the bank for essential records.


It is impossible to get a hold of the attorney because he NEVER answers his phone and doesn't want to talk until he wants to start asking for money.



I'm out of my mind doing our attorney's job for him alongside my day job and still getting nowhere.



I'd like to ask you all here, am I a paranoid asshole? How much of this is reasonable and, if so, how badly do I need a new attorney? Can I change my attorney now? What process do I need to go through? Aside from word of mouth or taking a gamble on the bar are there ways to find honest attorneys? I fully understand that he may be an exception rather than the norm, but he is the only lawyer I've really dealt with and it is a painful experience.

We had a local + large septic company come through and perform a thorough inspection of the septic system (including the use of a digital camera probe to snake through the various parts). Of the areas inspected, EVERYTHING failed. The distribution box was so full of roots they could not get the probe any further to inspect the laterals.

They ended up crossing over the centerline and getting stuck on that side by a small median. The vehicle looked like it made an attempt to jump the median by swerving back towards it when it impacted an oncoming vehicle at which point it did jump the median and both vehicles collided with us.

The driver and one passenger fled the scene on foot, but were caught on Wednesday night. Unfortunately for the third passenger, they left her in the car and it caught fire in 2-3 minutes after the accident. She died of smoke inhalation.

I recently moved into a house very close to campus of pur local university. We have a small driveway in the front that can fit one car and a gravel lot behind our back yard that can fit 3-4 more cars accessed via an alley.

I've left notes on the vehicles to no avail, often seeing the same car show back up. Towing would be an obvious option, but my roommate is feeling extra vindictive.

My question: would it be legal in Colorado to boot these cars with our own personal car boot seeing as it is illegally parked on our property?

Two weeks ago, I bought a used iPhone XR on Facebook Marketplace. I met a husband and wife at a local coffee shop and exchanged pleasantries. The husband works for the same large company as I do, and the wife works for a local hospital. I later looked up the husband in my employee directory, and he is who he says he is, they're not making any efforts to conceal their identities. I tried the SIM card in my phone and it worked with no issues, I pay them.

The phone used to be active on Sprint, but it was (according to them) purchased outright, so it should work with all US carriers. I am on AT&amp;T.

Fast forward to yesterday, and the new phone loses network access and stops working. I called AT&amp;T support on my Fiancee's phone, and they told me that the device was reported lost or stolen, and there was nothing they could do to bring it back online. I ran a report on the device, and it was reported as ""Ever blacklisted"", but not ""Currently blacklisted"" by a reputable phone checking service. I did check the SN/IMEI when I bought the phone and it was all clear. I even put the SIM card back into my original phone, and it doesn't work there now either.

Frustrated, I contacted the sellers again, and they have been very responsive, claiming that they never reported the device lost or stolen, and reaffirming that the device was owned wholly by them with no payment plan on it at the time of its sale to me. They sent me transcripts of chats with Sprint support, affirming that they do not have any outstanding holds on the device. That's all well and good, but I still am not able to use my new phone as intended. AT&amp;T says the issue is not on their end, so they can't do anything about it, but Sprint says there is no issue at all, so they can't do anything. This is maddening.

The phone's serial number and IMEI were published in the original Facebook marketplace ad, is it possible that someone else reported this device lost or stolen for a laugh? I know that seems like a wild theory, but I'm just trying to figure out how I got into this situation.

I know that many will say, ""They're scamming you!"", but it seems so unlikely that someone scamming me would use their real Facebook page, their real names, continue to talk to me after the fact, and tell me that they work for the same company as me when I could easily look up where he works and go to his desk at the office.

After some time that plan fell through and although that happened 1 month ago we were only notified recently that we have 4 days from Friday of last week to move out. When I told the Sheriff/Bailiff that we weren&amp;#39;t even notified that that they sent out another claim for eviction on May 26th because of the broken agreement. Apparently that they have no control of whether or not we receive these notices in the mail. The only thing is there was a long period of time that we haven&amp;#39;t received mail at the address. Even after repeated requests to receive them. I&amp;#39;m just unsure whether or not I&amp;#39;m able to do anything because I wasn&amp;#39;t given an adequate amount of time to prepare things to move out. I&amp;#39;m locked out of the place. And now have only a couple days to retrieve whatever I can. If I was given the right amount of time I wouldn&amp;#39;t have an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would just like to know if there is something wrong with this process that I just went through. Or if I have any legal backing and rights that have been violated.&lt;/p&gt;

Originally, my uncle owned a large plot of land neighboring my family's property, sold the land to a family ""friend"" (very much in quotes) who built a house there, and held the mortgage on the land with a contract at 5% interest. 

When my uncle passed away in 2007, my father--to a fault a generous, understanding, and rather financially naive man, as you will see--inherited the mortgage note. This is where the problems start.

The friend continued paying on the principal until 2009, then gave my dad a story about financial troubles, and continued paying only the interest until 2013...when he stopped paying entirely. All the while promising he'd pay when he could, of course. (For what it's worth, the friend has been employed and living lavishly all this time, huge house, multiple nice cars, hired landscapers every week...he is definitely taking brazen advantage, not a struggling but genuine guy fallen on hard times. Meanwhile my dad is working himself to death in manual labor and living modestly. Yes, this situation really grinds my gears.)

I only found out about the whole thing yesterday and looked up the New Jersey statute of limitations on debt, which appears to be 6 years. Since the friend continued paying interest biannually (February and August, last payment Feb 2013), the first lapsed payment should be six years ago this August as I understand it. 

What I can't seem to find out is...what could happen at that point? Could the entire six-figure debt potentially just be wiped away? My father does still hold the deed to the land since the mortgage wasn't paid off yet--he couldn't lose that, right?

During this next month, what should we be doing? Could we have the contract redrawn or something? I'm encouraging my father to hire a real estate lawyer. He still believes the family friend has good intentions and ""he'll get paid eventually"" and doesn't want to cause a confrontation or burn any bridges.

We’ve had a plumber/handyman working at our house on a couple things over a few days. He really took a liking to our dogs and would bring treats for them and play with them in the backyard. There was a time that he went from the front yard to the backyard and both my wife and I mentioned separately for him to make sure the gates were closed because our dogs are flight risks. He removed a bunch of carpet and left it in the garage to pick up later. It was a couple days after the work was done that he came by to pick up the carpet. He had our garage code as he had done work while we weren’t there before but on this particular day there was no reason for him come inside our actual house. He texted my wife to ask if he could visit the dogs while he waited for his crew and she said yes. We weren’t home so we aren’t 100% sure what happened but our dogs got out and ran up the street and our youngest dog attacked an unleashed dog that was in our neighbors yard. Thankfully the neighbor’s dog did make it but his vet bills totaled $6000. This has been devastating for us as dog lovers and as members of this community and we are horrified at the whole situation. We reimbursed our neighbor for the vet bill immediately and made the difficult decision to rehome our beloved pet. This entire situation is still difficult to talk about but the further we get from it we are like wondering if the plumber holds any liability for $6000.

I just bought a house with what I thought was a very nice backyard, but after looking into installing a fence (for my dog) it seems that the legal property line is wildly different from the areas that were maintained by the previous homeowner based on natural boundaries. Obviously the town wont likely approve a fence outside my property line, I'm just curious about what my options are depending on how zealous I am about pursuing this. Here are some pertinent details:

1. The area that I thought was my property based on natural boundaries and past owner maintenance is actually part of an adjacent cemetery.
2. The area in question is not at all near any graves, furthermore there is an impassible barrier of trees and ivy between this area and the grave sites (see image: [https://imgur.com/GS7Wgu6](https://imgur.com/GS7Wgu6)).
3. Finding a way to extend a fence through this area would be highly beneficial because it increases the usable backyard area by 25%-ish.
4. Location: Monroe County, NY, USA

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that out of the way, I have some questions:

1. Is there any scenario where I can legally build a fence on this area without purchasing that piece of property? Like with some legal agreement between me and the cemetery owner (perhaps involving compensation)?
2. If the above won't work, what are possible steps towards collaborating with the cemetery owner to perhaps subdivide and purchase the area in question? Surveyor, attorney, government fees, etc. The area would otherwise be wasted space if it is excluded by a fence, and I am prepared to offer fair compensation.
3. How do I go about finding the owner of the cemetery? I have the cemetery parcel's New York ""Tax ID"", but the online deed records don't go back far enough to have any documents, and the tax records don't have a name (perhaps because cemeteries are tax free?). The most recent gravestone has a 1910 death date, and it appears to be a family cemetery (someone cuts the grass, don't know who).

My question is how can I get the cemetery to add his second middle name initial? Can they even do that? I'm not looking to sue them or get money for it or anything. I'm sure it was an honest mistake.

8 days ago we received a visit from child services (Office of Children and Families here in Australia). Where they stated they had concerns for the welfare of the children. Not knowing the exact complaints we had an idea as they asked frequently about the kids being assaulted and going without food. 

They continued to ask about their mother and the situation around that issue and I told them everything they needed to know, produced documents for everything they needed, they spoke with the 2 kids, and they were on their way. 

It seemed odd to me that they would mention assault as we are entirely against it. We do have food and aren't exactly struggling. But, the officer kept quoting one of the kids saying ""they miss their mum and want to go live with them"". 

As they are in councilling, their therapists frequently talk to us openly about any concerns they have and not one time have they brought up anything familiar about this scenario. 

I asked the boys if they had any idea where they might have got this information and my eldest said that he ""tells the teacher that we hit him because he wants to leave us and live with his mum"".

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little at a loss on what to do in this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in May, I decided to switch from ATT postpaid plan to a prepaid one. Somewhere along the lines, something got messed up. Apparently, they had been continuing to charge me for data even though the original postpaid account should have been closed. Now I have a bill of $1200 that I have no idea how to pay. I have tried contacting them since I first got notification about the bill, but I have just been getting the run around ever since then. I got a letter in the mail that I'm on my final notice and that the account would be sent to collections fairly soon. They keep telling me that the charges are valid and that there is basically no way of reversing them, so I guess I'm going to have to figure out some way of paying it even though I never got any notice or bill that I was still being charged after I switched my account to prepaid.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on increasing my credit score as of late and have been doing fairly well, getting it to almost 700. And I've heard that collections can seriously ruin that and any decent chances at a good score. I'm 23 and will be graduating college in two more years, so I don't want something major that would affect my chances in the future. I stumbled upon LendingClub while browsing CreditKarma and was wondering if a personal loan is a good route to take instead of maxing out the pair of credit cards that I do have.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23 from Georgia, I bring in about $1000 a month. I have car payments at $230 (about $7000 remaining on the loan) and a phone bill at $60. I suppose I could also use the loan to pay off my remaining credit card debt &lt;$1500 too, but I'm not really sure what is a good route to take. I bank with Wells Fargo and Navy Fed (prior military) if either of those provides better loan options.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

People associate PTSD with that most often but mine stems from childhood sexual abuse. If I need to be more specific I will below: 

Cause of PTSD (trigger warning for rape): 

From when I was around 9-17 years old, my 2 older brothers would sneak into my room at night and rape me. From years of counseling, I came to figure out I was silent and just took it because I watch my mom abuse my father growing up and I didn’t want to ruin the family and add more issues so I kept it quiet. 

When it all came out, I had to deal with the court throughout my senior year in high school. My mother blamed me and called me a whore. When I went off to college, I tried to overdose to kill my self. I was saved at the hospital but not without ruining my stomach (so I get ulcers now). I was almost kicked from the university for being a threat but in order to stay, I had to see a counselor 2 times a week and see someone to get on medication while also meeting with an advisor. I did all of that and got my bachelors degree. 

Skip ahead 10 years, I am working my dream job but because of a new structure to the job and the company I work for got sold and a lot of changes are taking place, my stress has exploded. We don’t get bonuses anymore which were almost a guarantee. I can’t afford anything. I am so stressed that I had a mental breakdown and started breaking things in my apartment. This is not me. This is not who I am or want to be. I probably have spent an hour or so at work crying everyday for the last week. 

My nightmares of my brothers still happen from time to time. I am scared to sleep 99% of the time and need to sleep with the tv going so I don’t feel alone and trick my mind to feel secure that if anyone comes to rape me, it will sounds like there’s people awake and a light. But all of this is increasing with the new added stress. 

I almost can’t manage myself anymore. I had a migraine for 3 days straight and now a headache for another 3 days straight. 

My mind constantly forgets to do everyday things like eat, feed the cats, call family/boyfriend, ect. And my mind constantly just goes blank/black. I will be talking to my boyfriend and then go blank, like a light randomly turned off. When I do remember to eat, I can’t stop eating until I feel sick. 

There’s just so much and I feel like giving up. I been able to manage it with a job that wasn’t stressful and let me go at my own pace but now I have to do twice as much work with less money and if I keep this up, I feel I will eventually end up at the hospital for suicidal thoughts again. I was feeling this stress and suicidal at my last full time job too (both graphic design jobs) and was sent to the hospital by my employer but was fired a couple months later. 

I know I can physically work. I don’t want to be someone who uses disability as an excuse not to work but I have stuff to pay and emotionally/mentally, I feel I am just about to explode and give up on life. I also feel so stupid asking on Reddit but I honestly have no idea where else to ask.

We don’t get bonuses anymore which were almost a guarantee. I can’t afford anything. I am so stressed that I had a mental breakdown and started breaking things in my apartment. This is not me. This is not who I am or want to be. I probably have spent an hour or so at work crying everyday for the last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My nightmares of my brothers still happen from time to time. I am scared to sleep 99% of the time and need to sleep with the tv going so I don’t feel alone and trick my mind to feel secure that if anyone comes to rape me, it will sounds like there’s people awake and a light. But all of this is increasing with the new added stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost can’t manage myself anymore. I had a migraine for 3 days straight and now a headache for another 3 days straight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind constantly forgets to do everyday things like eat, feed the cats, call family/boyfriend, ect. And my mind constantly just goes blank/black. I will be talking to my boyfriend and then go blank, like a light randomly turned off. When I do remember to eat, I can’t stop eating until I feel sick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s just so much and I feel like giving up. I been able to manage it with a job that wasn’t stressful and let me go at my own pace but now I have to do twice as much work with less money and if I keep this up, I feel I will eventually end up at the hospital for suicidal thoughts again. I was feeling this stress and suicidal at my last full time job too (both graphic design jobs) and was sent to the hospital by my employer but was fired a couple months later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I can physically work. I don’t want to be someone who uses disability as an excuse not to work but I have stuff to pay and emotionally/mentally, I feel I am just about to explode and give up on life. I also feel so stupid asking on Reddit but I honestly have no idea where else to ask. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the flare looked like it could have gone under a couple different topics but I picked the best I could.&lt;/p&gt;

As the title states my bag is missing, possibly stolen, due to a handling error by United Airline.  
Firstly, the bag got delayed at San Fransisco Airport so I decided to have the bag delivered to my home address and the delivery service which specifically states that they do not deliver after 10pm delivered my bag at 2am outside some random apartment – not my apartment. The apartment  in front of which the bag was delivered is fairly close to where I live, so I went to check if the bag was still there and unsurprisingly the bag was missing. The leasing and parcel office for the apartment haven't seen any bag of the kind, and the apartment owners say they didn't see any bag at their doorstep either. I have already filed a police report stating this situation and they are contacting the airlines to know further details.   

Additionally, the hold times for the baggage resolution center for United Airlines is around an hour every time I call which is a major pain.   

I plan on claiming compensation for the contents of the bag however  the claims process on their website shows it takes around 6 weeks to complete and I genuinely cannot wait that long. Is there any way I could get a faster resolution of the process due to the amount of inconvenience it is causing.

* This is a college town, nearly all of the apartment complexes are low quality - especially the place I'm talking about here.
* My SO and I lived here because we're both broke, full-time students.
* We're located in Michigan, USA.
* When you move into a new place, almost all of them (and this might be everywhere, but I'll still explain it) make you fill out a move-in checklist. You go room to room noting all of the damages in the apartment before you move in.

&amp;#x200B;

My SO and I moved out of our old apartment on May 31st of this year. When our lease began last August, we filled out a move-in checklist pretty thoroughly. Since the apartment complex is cheap student housing, most of the rooms needed to have something written, i.e. kitchen cabinet doors were falling off, carpet was separating at the bottom of the stairs, etc. Something I specifically remember writing for just about *every* room was that the walls were covered in marks/scuffed up/dirty.

The apartment complex/their management did not contact us once to get the damages we initially reported on the checklist taken care of. After a couple of days living there, we realized the dishwasher didn't work too, so we contacted them and had someone sent out. Another couple of days later, the dishwasher breaks again and another service guy is sent out. Well, it broke again so we said fuck it and washed dishes by hand all year since they weren't going to fix it correctly. The apartment complex also repaints all of the unit's doors once a year. When those guys came by, one of them told us our kick plate below the door was broken - nothing ever came of that either, even when they were the ones who noticed it. I mention these things to give context towards how unresponsive and slow-to-act the complex was throughout the duration of our lease. Keep in mind that all of our initially reported damages still weren't taken care of and never did get taken care of.

Fast forward to a week ago and we get a bill in the mail for $390. There were $140 in damages for 3 pairs of blinds and a towel bar; while we don't agree with the ridiculous up-charge on that, we have no problem paying it. However, there is a $250 charge to repaint the walls throughout the apartment; the itemized list they gave us literally says ""paint up bedrooms, marks on walls."" The bill they sent us is dated June 27th 2019, and it says verbatim:

&gt;In accordance with MI law, balance due must be received and paid in full no later than 7 days to eliminate court papers. Court papers will be filed for any outstanding balance and court costs will be your responsibility.   
&gt;  
&gt;You must respond to this notice by mail within 7 days after receipt of same, otherwise you will forfeit the amount claimed for damages.

We left for vacation on Wednesday, June 26th and returned home on Monday, July 1st. I saw the bill that Monday night when we got home and emailed the apartment complex on Tuesday while I was at work. In my first email, sent around 1:30pm on Tuesday, I asked for an itemized list, not realizing that there was already one attached to the back of the bill they sent us. Later that night when I realized we had the itemized list already, I sent a second email asking why we were being charged to repaint the walls when they were never repainted for us when we first moved in. How can they be sure the damages were from us and not the last tenant if they never painted them for us? Regardless, we did not receive an email back from them Tuesday or Wednesday, and because of the holiday weekend, they're closed today through next Monday. 

Since we have only 7 days to submit payment or they'll take us to court, do I have to pay them? They have failed to communicate with me at all about the charges, our move-in checklist shows that the walls were dirty when we first moved in, and they definitely don't have a work order stating they came to service our apartment because it never happened. Also, since today is a holiday, does that affect the due date of this bill? Am I legally obligated to pay the $390 now? If I have to, is there a way I can recover the $250 after the fact from them? I'm sure they will still not paint our apartment for the next tenants and then pull the same shit on them too, claiming that they dirtied the walls while they fail to ever repaint them.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little background information: &lt;/p&gt;

United States

Background:

I used to travel quite frequently for work, and when I moved back to the area, I had no furniture and basically only needed a room to rent. I found this roommate(let’s call her R) on Craigslist, and at the time, she was living in another house with another person and they were seeking a third roommate. It quickly became apparent that the house was basically R’s, and that the other roommate and I were only renting rooms. 

R and I basically both kept to ourselves for most of that time we lived in that house (about 8 months). When the lease ended, R and I found a new place and signed a lease together. We split the security deposit. 

Things were not by any means ideal in the new house, and sharing a bathroom + space with R was an adjustment. I was still traveling semi-regularly for work during the first year, and so it was basically a place to crash. 

R has always enforced this idea that it isn’t my house — she frequently just tells me that her friends, family members, and/or her partner are coming to stay at our house for extended periods of time - her partner will come stay for a month about 2-3 times a year. I have only received payment on bills for this one time during this time, during the first year of the lease (which made me think maybe it will happen every now and then — but it doesn’t). I have brought it up more than once. 

About 2 months after we re-signed the lease for this year and I started a new job with different hours, I was around more frequently, and we began to not get along.
Since this time there have been several clashes due to living styles and cleanliness levels, and I have been extremely uncomfortable in the home — because I feel like no space there is mine, except my room, and that I have paid 1/2 of bills and rent for 1 room so that one of my roommate’s friends etc can basically live there for free 1/3 of the time. I also feel like R feels as though she is being fair. 

Because of these feelings and my uncomfortableness there, I have been spending most of my time at my boyfriend’s house during the last 6 months. I only cook at his house also, so I don’t use the kitchen at my roommate’s house other than the fridge for storage.

I moved out 1 month and 2 weeks early, with the intention of getting someone to sublet my room. I cleaned my room very well, and I cleaned the cabinet and shelves in the kitchen that I used for storage. I cleaned the areas of the bathroom that I kept my stuff. All of this stuff is move-out levels of cleanliness.

Since I moved out, R has resigned the lease. There is one month until the end of our lease and I have paid the rent for this month while living in my new place. I have to go back to the house and pick up some cleaning supplies.

Because R is staying, I agreed to do a walkthrough with her of (what I planned to be) my areas of inhabitance... since agreeing to this walkthrough, R has texted me multiple times insisting that I help her “spring clean” the entire house (something she never did when I lived there). She believes that even areas that contain none of my stuff and that I haven’t used ever or in months are my responsibility -  Like she actually expects me to move her furniture and kitchen items and clean underneath them. I have indulged some of this in the entryway I used, because I have a dog and there was hair to clean. I also wiped the baseboards and a few other things, but I consider this to be enough. 

When I moved into the old house, only the areas I was moving into were move in ready. She’s insisting on cleaning the entire house before even showing it to anyone, and at this point I have basically decided I would rather not even try to get someone to sublet just because I don’t want to deal with her. It’s gotten to the point that she is nagging me and insisting that it’s my responsibility to split these duties with her or to hire someone and split the costs.

Here’s an actual text she sent: “I re-signed the lease with Orange so I’ve got a couple folks lined up that want to see the place (one who would like to move in sooner than later). But of course i won’t show it until the whole house has been thoroughly cleaned. I’ve continued working on it over the weekend but it still has a long way to go. Do you have an idea when you’ll be back to help with more cleaning? Alternatively I know a woman looking for cleaning work and I can hire her and we could split the cost if you prefer”

All of the areas she’s talking about cleaning are areas that were made dirty by her and her many guests. I refuse to do any more work or to pay any more money.

I am still supposed to do a walkthrough, but I feel as though she’s going to try to ask me to do excessive things and it could escalate. I have taken photos of the communal areas I cleaned “before” and I do have a list of the stuff I did.

I’m also worried she is going to try to screw me on the security deposit if I don’t help her clean her mess, because she’s still living there. 


tl;dr: I moved out early because of a dirty, inconsiderate roommate. I agreed to a walkthrough of (what I thought) was my areas of inhabitance. Since this agreement, my old roommate is insisting I come and help clean up their mess and walkthrough the entire house. 

I paid the security deposit to a rental company, but because she re-signed the lease they are considering it a renewal and want the money to stay in trust. Basically, they told me that a roommate normally pays the other roommate 1/2 of the security deposit when the other moves out... R is obviously trying to force me to clean etc. due to this, because she knows she is in control of the money. However, all the stipulations of my lease with the rental company have been met, and she is trying to hold me to her own rules to receive my $. I have talked to the rental company but I have to wait to talk to someone else on Monday. I told R I would be back this week to finish some stuff up, but I’m not going back until I speak to the landlord.

Have I met my legal obligations? Is the landlord allowed to do this with the money? It seems illegal that they would give a random person control over another person’s security deposit. 

What are my options regarding small claims court?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crosspost from &lt;a href=""/r/relationships""&gt;r/relationships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United States&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to travel quite frequently for work, and when I moved back to the area, I had no furniture and basically only needed a room to rent. I found this roommate(let’s call her R) on Craigslist, and at the time, she was living in another house with another person and they were seeking a third roommate. It quickly became apparent that the house was basically R’s, and that the other roommate and I were only renting rooms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R and I basically both kept to ourselves for most of that time we lived in that house (about 8 months). When the lease ended, R and I found a new place and signed a lease together. We split the security deposit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were not by any means ideal in the new house, and sharing a bathroom + space with R was an adjustment. I was still traveling semi-regularly for work during the first year, and so it was basically a place to crash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R has always enforced this idea that it isn’t my house — she frequently just tells me that her friends, family members, and/or her partner are coming to stay at our house for extended periods of time - her partner will come stay for a month about 2-3 times a year. I have only received payment on bills for this one time during this time, during the first year of the lease (which made me think maybe it will happen every now and then — but it doesn’t). I have brought it up more than once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2 months after we re-signed the lease for this year and I started a new job with different hours, I was around more frequently, and we began to not get along.
Since this time there have been several clashes due to living styles and cleanliness levels, and I have been extremely uncomfortable in the home — because I feel like no space there is mine, except my room, and that I have paid 1/2 of bills and rent for 1 room so that one of my roommate’s friends etc can basically live there for free 1/3 of the time.

I live in IL and have been separated from my husband for almost two years now. We have a 3 year old. My ex has a girlfriend that he lives next door to, and she watches my kid while hes with his dad. There is no custody agreement on paper, but typically we exchange every other week. 

I have just hired a lawyer and he is out of town for the holiday so I can't contact him, and all of this just happened two days ago. 

Basically, this girlfriend is bad news. She has a history of domestic violence and just got off probation for her last offense maybe 5 months ago. My ex has told me that she hits him constantly, and has even pulled a knife on him before. She is always trying to pick fights and is extremely argumentative. She is also pregnant now with my ex's child (allegedly.) My ex says none of this ever happens around our kid, but I do know she has lost custody of her own child in the past and recently got the child back. 

Two days ago while my son was over there she and my ex got into a fight. She beat my ex up in front of my kid. My ex was covered in blood and the cops were called. my ex told me that she ripped a tablet out of my son's hands and then started beating the hell out of my ex. He told me she was getting arrested. He dropped my kid off at my mom's house and I picked him up. He had no shoes, so I went back to my ex's to get his shoes. Well the gf was there and inside his apartment. I told my ex he was an idiot and we started arguing, and she came out and started yelling at me. Long story short, my ex said it would never happen again and that he trusted her to be around our child and that they were getting back together. He took my son out of the car and after some convincing I got him to put my son back and I left. 

The next day I went to the police dept to attempt to get a copy of the police report and find out what actually happened. They told me that the story he told me and the story he told the officers was COMPLETELY different and that they both said it was an accident and nothing happened. No one was arrested. They had me fill out a statement about what my ex told me happened and that they'd get a copy of the report to me as soon as it was done. They said they thought it was in my son's best interest to keep her away from him. 

I attempted to file an order of protection with my residence and my son as a protected party, but I was denied because OPs are apparently only for related parties. I then attempted to file a stalking no contact order and that was denied as well due to not having reasonable grounds for an emergency order. 

The cops told me that if my ex were to show up at my house they wouldn't make me give my son to him, however I'm still concerned. Do I have any right to keep my son away from his dad and his gf for now? Like I said there is no formal custody agreement. I don't want my son to have to witness any more domestic issues between them, as he is already a little shaken up by this and has been talking about how his dad's gf jumped on his dad and beat him up.

It's pretty long but I would definitely appreciate the responses. I am located in San Jose, CA. I have an issue that has repeated itself. I have the right to believe that the restaurant I’m working at right now has a manager that has been stealing tips from the employees. It's a chain restaurant like Cheesecake Factory or Maggiano's. I currently work as carry-out aside from the other duties I do but that is my main job at the moment. The way I believe tips were stolen were set through the system. I currently work as carry-out and in the pantry but this will concern the carry-out side.

When people set up orders either online or big catering orders through the management and that’s what is a BEO.

A banquet event order for catering.

When I set up those orders, it's available to me through the POS System to close out, and with closing those out I am able to collect the check in my name considering that is the work I have done and that is the order I have fulfilled.

I do these orders and sometimes there is a driver hired by the restaurant through door dash when it comes to delivery for those. Since the check is closed through me, with my years of working here I have been informed that only I keep those tips, and if there is someone else working with me we share them as we both did the work. Along with also sharing some of the pool with the kitchen. (This will apply to my story later)

The only way we would share tips for a delivery is if our store had a driver, where then we would share tips with the driver (we used to have one before the management that is here currently)

I believe this manager is stealing tips is through this way.

Instead of the order being available on my system as I mentioned earlier so that I could close out, I am assuming he transfers it to his own account or another account where he can close out, and safely remove the cash from the register or safe for himself with no repercussions.

He instead will show me the ticket that comes out of the cook's printer and tells me that is the order, not providing anything but the name and the items listed.

For the first time I’ve experienced this, we had received an order from another restaurant which unfortunately was flooded, and so the BEO was transferred to the location I work at where customers had to pick up their catering order through us.

When seeing this BEO there was a tip on it. Me and a co-worker would be able to split it once completing the order but we were wondering how to be able to submit it into the system since it was not showing in the system, meaning someone else closed it out, or it made sense that since it was a transferred order it did not appear set in our system for that day, meaning the order had to be just told to the cooks.

I was working alone in the morning and was the first to ask this to the manager.

When asking the manager about how I would put in the tips, I was told “This doesn’t apply to you since it is an order from the other store”

This made me wonder, then who does the money go to, it would make sense if the other store collects the payment, but the tip is not theirs as me and my co-worker were doing the work.

I was told to not be greedy as another order had tipped me already.

Greedy because I’m entitled to the tips I receive?

I told him if it was even a quarter I appreciate anything people are willing to tip.

He laughed at me and said “You want a quarter? Here you go.” And laid it on the table for me laughing.

Once my other co-worker arrived I let her know about the situation. Showed her the order details showing the payment. She agreed that it didn’t seem right that the money wouldn’t go to us.

When telling her though and checking with another manager, the main manager that told me about the order in the morning ran to us and gave the same explanation. He's always monitoring everyone (understandable as a manager) and has even told me he watches everyone to make sure they don't talk about him, almost in a threatening way although I don't care enough to talk behind peoples backs as I would rather do it up front if I had an issue. But I see it as he doesn't want anyone else to slip up for what he does.

I told that co-worker later, that when he leaves to let another manager that I’ll name Manager2 about the order.

Manager2 was from a different location coming into help as we have been understaffed.

I was later informed by that carry-out co worker that the order was in fact in our system, and she was able to take out that money, leaving my half in the safe.

That was the first time I experienced that and I have been growing suspicious.

For the most recent time, this has just happened Saturday June the 15th I believe.

I walked into work, informed by my other co-worker the day before that there is an order that includes a big tip for me to do in the morning.

Immediately, I know that it’ll be hidden from me as on Saturday mornings that manager opens the store.

I walk in, and wait to clock in at my time. I walk over to him and ask him, what order are we working on? He proceeds to say, “What order?” In a mocking tone.

I tell him, the order the chef is working on right now.

He runs and grabs the firing ticket that shows me the food items, (not the order sheet where I can see everything in full detail)I tell him I want to see the firing sheet. He acts like he lost it and is figuring out where it went, and then runs to his office. I’m told by the chef that she just had it in front of her (possibly removed it as he saw me there a couple of minutes before my shift), implying this manager had just removed it hoping I wouldn’t ask about the details and just follow through. He hands it to me and I look at it and there is a big tip on it. I walk over to the computer pos system and check to make sure the order is there in order to be able to close out/review with the door dash driver that has been scheduled. The moment I enter the carry-out room the manager says out loud that it’s already closed out. I ask him, why would the order I’m working on be closed out if I didn’t do so yet. He explains that it is already in the system like that. I walk over to him and ask him how would I cash out on the tip that was presented. “That is not yours”

I tell him, how would it not be mine if I am the one in charge of the order in my shift.

He tells me it goes to the driver (Keep this in mind)

I tell him there’s something shady about this, first the order being hidden from me from the moment I got there and then being closed out under someone or something else.

He starts to yell “Are you questioning my integrity?” And I tell him “Your actions are making me question your integrity”

Soon he begins to get flustered and red saying “I’m going to call the district manager and have her explain it to you”

He takes me to his office and calls what I assume is the district manager.

He tells her, “Could you PLEASE tell \_\_\_\_\_\_ about the policy?”

She proceeds to tell me that the money goes to the driver, (of course but what she means is that it doesn't to the delivery driver if they're scheduled with door dash) but says it in the way that it goes into the restaurant in order to pay FOR the delivery drivers that get hired through door dash for the orders. She tells me that if I want to earn that money I should become a driver for the restaurant and apply for that.

I ask about why do people pay for delivery then and for that large sum of tip money why would that go back to the restaurant and not the actual employees working for that.

Things just seem suspicious from here, and shortly the call ends by saying I’m a great worker and thanks me for my job.

The manager grins at me, and says “We aren’t supposed to give you guys the tips for delivery drivers, it used to be like that before but we have just changed the policy.”

It’s interesting that the policy suddenly changes the moment there is a huge order with a huge tip (Past $150 dollars)

He proceeds to tell me that he was going to be nice enough and give me $40 dollars of that tip, because he is a nice guy, although like he said “He is not supposed to be giving me that money”

Because I questioned his integrity as he kept repeating, he will no longer give me a dime is what he says.

We walk out of the office and I go back to setting up the order for the delivery.

Later on in the day, he offers me the $40 again, I’m assuming because he wants me to keep my mouth shut about this issue and knows I know there’s a problem.

I decline, and continue with my day.

&amp;#x200B;

To add to his character, there is one more story.

Another issue that I would see as more of a loophole but not stealing would be with this story I have heard with another order, that had a tip of an estimated $340 dollars. (I was not here for this tip, but as I manage orders I was able to see it)

This was a huge order that would need an employee to work for, but conveniently that said employee was scheduled a different shift time than the usual. Anyone could see that this was because that manager did not want her to share in any part of the tip and wanted to do the work so that he would cash out for that otherwise I’m wondering where that money went.

When I asked this employee, she said she came in early of course to help out, but was being told they need no help as the manager would handle it entirely and would not allow her to clock in. No other carry-out was there for this order, an order of over $1500 dollars.

We usually start earlier but it’s interesting that he would schedule her later for once. I would not say this is stealing but more of taking advantage of being a manager in order to set things up for himself.

I’m not sure if a manager does an order if they are able to keep the money or what they do with it, but that’s just another story as I said.

I want to know what action I can take, how to take it, or if I’m in the wrong with this and there is nothing suspicious. I'll go ahead and provide any more details if needed. Thanks in advance to anyone! This store manager does not have the best reputation here, and even servers get upset as I've heard he has taken huge tables by himself in order to cash in the tips for himself. (makes sense you get the tips but you're a store manager and you have employees)

The only other person that I've mentioned all this too is the head chef, and she has mentioned filing with the labor union, she also agrees that he provides a negative environment. Still, I don't get why she hasn't spoken out on it, but I'll respect her and try to be the one to speak up for not just myself but for other employee's.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi legal advice reddit, I have a question regarding how tips in restaurants are handled.

We are originally from CT and are just up here temporarily for work.We originally thought we were only going to be there 3 months but the house were were purchasing wasn't closing as fast as we thought it would. It is now the middle of May and we learn we can move into our house by the June 1st. One of two landlords is outside gardening and my partner has a conversation with them about leaving. He asks to leave in the next weeks/by June 1st but if that is not an option we will be leaving by July 1st. Meaning, our last months rent we gave at signing would be applied to June. She said she would have to get back to us after talking to the other landlord but otherwise leaving by July 1st didn't seem like a problem. 

We didn't hear back from them about leaving early (we thought it was a stretch anyway) so we were left thinking that July 1st was the set move out by date. On June 2nd, my partner gets a call asking why wasn't rent paid and we said it was with last months rent. She claims that the notice we gave her was not proper and that we would have to stay another month (July). She stated she was going to call her lawyer and the police. My partner communicated to me, when I started to do research about my rights.

I went to the tax assessors office and the home doesn't even have the basement listed as finished, let alone as an in law. 

It is a raised ranch with an in-law apartment in the basement. It is a one bedroom apartment with only one door to exit the apartment. You have to go through three doors just to get outside. 

The contract says that they will not pay interest, but I am pretty sure it is the law.

I didn't receive a receipt from what bank my last month's rent was deposited.

I did not receive a statement of condition.

May 14: We talk to the landlord about leaving by June 1st if not July 1st. She said she would have to get back to us about      -------------June 1st but made it seem like July 1st was an okay date to move out by.

June 2: Phone call from landlord stating we were living there for free and she was going to call cops and her lawyer. Tried being civil and saying okay well can we pay you for  1/2 days in July to smooth this over. She said that they have financial obligations they have to take care of and we can't just not give proper notice.

June 3: I do research and go to the tax assessors office where there is no record of this apartment. Tax assessors say they will be paying her a visit once I vacate. I communicate with them and she says to me, "" Your partner didn't say that you would be leaving, ""he"" said he was moving out because he can't stand to be with you anymore."" ....we just bought a house... At this point I explain the situation about the contract being written against my rights as a tenant as well are her apartment not being legitimant  as far as the town was concerned. She said so you'll be out by the First of July and I said yes and that I expect my security deposit and interest upon leaving.

June 30: Up until this point they have been ignoring us at all costs. We clean the entire place (cleaner than when we moved in)  and once everything is moved and clean we leave and put the keys under their front matt. 

I wanted to give them the weekend to enjoy their holiday (and enjoy mine without thinking about it) and then call them Monday telling them the address to send the check.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be prepared for the phone call so I can face any personal attacks with a sense of confidence because I will have some knowledge. Please let me know what to do?

Thank you,

Guy who just wants to get out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been renting a place in Oxford, MA with my Partner since February 1st. We signed a month-to-month agreement giving a security deposit and first and last months rent. We are originally from CT and are just up here temporarily for work.We originally thought we were only going to be there 3 months but the house were were purchasing wasn&amp;#39;t closing as fast as we thought it would. It is now the middle of May and we learn we can move into our house by the June 1st. One of two landlords is outside gardening and my partner has a conversation with them about leaving. He asks to leave in the next weeks/by June 1st but if that is not an option we will be leaving by July 1st. Meaning, our last months rent we gave at signing would be applied to June. She said she would have to get back to us after talking to the other landlord but otherwise leaving by July 1st didn&amp;#39;t seem like a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#39;t hear back from them about leaving early (we thought it was a stretch anyway) so we were left thinking that July 1st was the set move out by date. On June 2nd, my partner gets a call asking why wasn&amp;#39;t rent paid and we said it was with last months rent. She claims that the notice we gave her was not proper and that we would have to stay another month (July). She stated she was going to call her lawyer and the police. My partner communicated to me, when I started to do research about my rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the tax assessors office and the home doesn&amp;#39;t even have the basement listed as finished, let alone as an in law. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a raised ranch with an in-law apartment in the basement. It is a one bedroom apartment with only one door to exit the apartment. You have to go through three doors just to get outside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract says that they will not pay interest, but I am pretty sure it is the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t receive a receipt from what bank my last month&amp;#39;s rent was deposited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not receive a statement of condition.  &lt;/p&gt;

Both legal aide places I contacted weren't able to assist me due to budget issues.

tl;dr Month to month tenant, never late on rent. Called city due to no hot water. Landlord retaliated by filing an eviction with a non-existant corporation as the Plaintiff. Turns out he doesn't own the building. Only ordered to pay rent as it's due at Motion to Determine Rent hearing. Landlord refuses to settle for less than us saying he's right and paying all his lawyer fees plus $5000. Because of the eviction, we haven't been able to find a place to move. They either deny us outright or demand a crazy high deposit.

Month to month tenant, never late on rent, paid by personal check. Had to call the city in March due to no hot water for 2 weeks. Landlord was pissed immediately after and made threats, but calmed down and apologized the next day. All seemed fine for about 7 weeks, then we were served with an eviction complaint saying we owed 2 months rent. Never got a three day notice. Literally the only correct items on the complaint were the address of our apartment and the monthly amount.

The Inc. listed as the Plaintiff was different than the Inc. we made our checks out to. At first, we just assumed he had multiple companies like my aunt-in-law does for her properties and filed our Answer and Motion To Determine rent using the name listed on the complaint, but noted in both that our rental agreement stipulated payment to a different Inc. Last week while preparing my interrogatories and discovery, I discovered that no Inc. by that name has ever existed in Florida nor has any company by that name every paid business tax in Miami-Dade County. This isn't a typo, it appears multiple times on multiple documents, including the paperwork appointing landlord as an agent for the Inc. that was dated 2014.

After discovering that, I checked who owned the building. Turns out it's actually owned by landlord's ex-wife's LLC. I filed a motion to amend our answer with this new information, but the judge hasn't ruled on it yet.

The next parts were included in our original answer:

He claimed our first missed payment was on April 1, he posted a 3-Day Notice on April 15, filed the complaint on May 15, but claimed we owed 2 months rent on both. Our due date is the 10th of the month. There is no way for us to owe 2 months rent on both the notice and complaint unless he accepted payment after the notice because the rent became due again between the notice and complaint.

I filed a Motion To Determine Rent and raised defective 3 Day Notice, waiver for accepting rent after the alleged date posted the 3 Day Notice, and retaliation in my Answer. I attached a copy of our rental agreement (because landlord didn't), front and back check images for March, April, and May, rent reciepts for March, April, May, and the text exchanges with the city plumbing inspector.

Right about the time my landlord would have received my Answer, someone with enough information to convince FPL that they were my husband had our electricity shut off. Thankfully, we got our electricity back on in about 90 minutes. We still filed a counter claim. The judges were in the middle of rotating, so it took about 3 weeks for the MtDR hearing. Landlord hired an attorney literally the day before the hearing. The judge ruled that we owed no back rent, but didn't dismiss the case. I was too nervous to ask why he denied my motion. He ordered me to just pay rent to the court as it's due (already was) and ordered us to mediation. He also strongly advised both of us to settle.

When we were leaving court, Landlord's attorney asked me to schedule the mediation and send his an e-mail with the date and time. I did so as soon as I got home and I also sent an settlement offer that I thought was more than fair considering Landlord committed perjury. His attorney called me and said he would only settle for us saying we didn't pay rent, paying his $7000+ in costs (his attorney had only been hired 2 days before), and paying an additional $5000 for ""stress."" I literally laughed and hung up on him.

I start pouring myself into research because it's really looking like we're going to trial and I discover the information about the Inc. listed as the Plaintiff having no record of existing in Florida and the building actually being owned by Landlord's ex-wife's LLC. I filed motions to Amend my answer and counterclaim with this new information and add the landlord personally since there was no ""veil."" I'm still waiting for the judge to rule on them. Landlord's attorney called me super pissed and informed me that if I didn't ""admit I lied"" in those motions and meet the landlord's settlement demands, they would file a suit for ruining my landlord's reputation. I didn't laugh this time, but I did hang up on him again and ignored his 2 call back attempts. He hasn't filed anything yet.

Mediation is next week. I'm hoping a neutral 3rd party will knock some sense into them, but I'm not too optimistic. We've been trying to move since ""someone"" shut our electricity off, but the eviction is disqualifying us from most places and the others are asking for crazy high deposits (3-4x monthly rent) or wanting our income to be 4x monthly rent.

My questions are:

I was reading up on ""fraud upon the court"" as a possible way to get the main case dismissed, but the standard of evidence is higher than the normal civil court standard. How much higher is that bar? Do I need to prove a motive or just that 95% of his complaint is false?

I don't need another lawyer to tell me that Landlord's attorney certainly has terrible manners, but has he done anything illegal or enough to justify me filing a complaint with the bar? Should he have checked Landlord's story before taking the case? Should he have dropped Landlord once it was made clear that it was a baseless claim only brought in retaliation?

If Landlord refuses to settle and we end up going to trial, what can the judge order against Landlord when (/if) we win?

Can I request to be reimbursed for my time handling this? I was just going to list my hourly rate at $10, capped at $500.

Can my husband ask for missed wages for when he has to take off work for hearings/mediation?

Since this is happening while school is out, can we include the cost of a babysitter for our 4 kids if we need to get one for hearings/mediation?

Can Landlord be charged criminally for this?

How long will an eviction, even if we win, effect our ability to rent? Husband and I are in our 40's and we've never had an eviction before.

Is there a legal standard to calculate our future financial losses due to having a completely false eviction on our record? What data would we need to show the judge the amount we're asking for is fair?

Can the judge get in trouble for thanking me for having all my pleadings properly formatted? He didn't compliment the content, just that it was formatted correctly and made it easy for him to read. Trust me, most of the pro se arguments I've read in my research were handwritten, hot messes. Landlord's attorney seemed to think this is a major issue, though.

If there's anything else that may be useful to know, but I didn't ask, please let me know. We legit cannot afford an attorney and move. Needless to say, moving is essential because the man who has keys to our apartment has demonstrated he is perfectly willing to break the law to get back at us.

Thank you for taking time to read this.

Edited to add: Landlord's attorney made no arguements at the Motion To Determine Rent hearing. The judge looked at my checks and reciepts, asked the attorney if he had anything to say, attorney said ""No."" Judge didn't dismiss when I asked because he'd just rotated in from a city with better tenant protections and was not ""up to speed"" with tenant law for my city.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is happening within the City of Miami just in case there&amp;#39;s any city laws that may apply here. Both legal aide places I contacted weren&amp;#39;t able to assist me due to budget issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr Month to month tenant, never late on rent. Called city due to no hot water. Landlord retaliated by filing an eviction with a non-existant corporation as the Plaintiff. Turns out he doesn&amp;#39;t own the building. Only ordered to pay rent as it&amp;#39;s due at Motion to Determine Rent hearing. Landlord refuses to settle for less than us saying he&amp;#39;s right and paying all his lawyer fees plus $5000. Because of the eviction, we haven&amp;#39;t been able to find a place to move. They either deny us outright or demand a crazy high deposit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Month to month tenant, never late on rent, paid by personal check. Had to call the city in March due to no hot water for 2 weeks. Landlord was pissed immediately after and made threats, but calmed down and apologized the next day. All seemed fine for about 7 weeks, then we were served with an eviction complaint saying we owed 2 months rent. Never got a three day notice. Literally the only correct items on the complaint were the address of our apartment and the monthly amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inc. listed as the Plaintiff was different than the Inc. we made our checks out to. At first, we just assumed he had multiple companies like my aunt-in-law does for her properties and filed our Answer and Motion To Determine rent using the name listed on the complaint, but noted in both that our rental agreement stipulated payment to a different Inc. Last week while preparing my interrogatories and discovery, I discovered that no Inc. by that name has ever existed in Florida nor has any company by that name every paid business tax in Miami-Dade County. This isn&amp;#39;t a typo, it appears multiple times on multiple documents, including the paperwork appointing landlord as an agent for the Inc. that was dated 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After discovering that, I checked who owned the building. Turns out it&amp;#39;s actually owned by landlord&amp;#39;s ex-wife&amp;#39;s LLC. I filed a motion to amend our answer with this new information, but the judge hasn&amp;#39;t ruled on it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next parts were included in our original answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He claimed our first missed payment was on April 1, he posted a 3-Day Notice on April 15, filed the complaint on May 15, but claimed we owed 2 months rent on both. Our due date is the 10th of the month. There is no way for us to owe 2 months rent on both the notice and complaint unless he accepted payment after the notice because the rent became due again between the notice and complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I filed a Motion To Determine Rent and raised defective 3 Day Notice, waiver for accepting rent after the alleged date posted the 3 Day Notice, and retaliation in my Answer. I attached a copy of our rental agreement (because landlord didn&amp;#39;t), front and back check images for March, April, and May, rent reciepts for March, April, May, and the text exchanges with the city plumbing inspector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right about the time my landlord would have received my Answer, someone with enough information to convince FPL that they were my husband had our electricity shut off. Thankfully, we got our electricity back on in about 90 minutes. We still filed a counter claim. The judges were in the middle of rotating, so it took about 3 weeks for the MtDR hearing. Landlord hired an attorney literally the day before the hearing. The judge ruled that we owed no back rent, but didn&amp;#39;t dismiss the case. I was too nervous to ask why he denied my motion. He ordered me to just pay rent to the court as it&amp;#39;s due (already was) and ordered us to mediation. He also strongly advised both of us to settle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were leaving court, Landlord&amp;#39;s attorney asked me to schedule the mediation and send his an e-mail with the date and time. I did so as soon as I got home and I also sent an settlement offer that I thought was more than fair considering Landlord committed perjury. His attorney called me and said he would only settle for us saying we didn&amp;#39;t pay rent, paying his $7000+ in costs (his attorney had only been hired 2 days before), and paying an additional $5000 for &amp;quot;stress.&amp;quot; I literally laughed and hung up on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I start pouring myself into research because it&amp;#39;s really looking like we&amp;#39;re going to trial and I discover the information about the Inc. listed as the Plaintiff having no record of existing in Florida and the building actually being owned by Landlord&amp;#39;s ex-wife&amp;#39;s LLC. I filed motions to Amend my answer and counterclaim with this new information and add the landlord personally since there was no &amp;quot;veil.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m still waiting for the judge to rule on them. Landlord&amp;#39;s attorney called me super pissed and informed me that if I didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;admit I lied&amp;quot; in those motions and meet the landlord&amp;#39;s settlement demands, they would file a suit for ruining my landlord&amp;#39;s reputation. I didn&amp;#39;t laugh this time, but I did hang up on him again and ignored his 2 call back attempts. He hasn&amp;#39;t filed anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mediation is next week. I&amp;#39;m hoping a neutral 3rd party will knock some sense into them, but I&amp;#39;m not too optimistic. We&amp;#39;ve been trying to move since &amp;quot;someone&amp;quot; shut our electricity off, but the eviction is disqualifying us from most places and the others are asking for crazy high deposits (3-4x monthly rent) or wanting our income to be 4x monthly rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading up on &amp;quot;fraud upon the court&amp;quot; as a possible way to get the main case dismissed, but the standard of evidence is higher than the normal civil court standard. How much higher is that bar? Do I need to prove a motive or just that 95% of his complaint is false?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t need another lawyer to tell me that Landlord&amp;#39;s attorney certainly has terrible manners, but has he done anything illegal or enough to justify me filing a complaint with the bar? Should he have checked Landlord&amp;#39;s story before taking the case? Should he have dropped Landlord once it was made clear that it was a baseless claim only brought in retaliation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I request to be reimbursed for my time handling this? I was just going to list my hourly rate at $10, capped at $500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long will an eviction, even if we win, effect our ability to rent? Husband and I are in our 40&amp;#39;s and we&amp;#39;ve never had an eviction before.&lt;/p&gt;

Now there's a ton of lessons learned here at this point of how to handle things moving forward, but I am in a situation now and want to know how I can handle this.

I live in Arizona so I gave her a 30-day notice to evict.  She does not and has never paid rent, and there is no tenant contract.  She no longer lives at the property, but I have maintained access for her as she has threatened to call the cops if I do not.

One verbal agreement we had is that she would pay half of the utilities.  Though after a recent and more expensive shopping trip I had verbally agreed to wave this for a month.  However, she has now entered the premises and taken everything from that purchase.

I have now asked her to pay the remainder of the utilities, though any contact is met with ""You are harassing me, stop contacting me""

She has also knowingly caused a considerable amount of damage to the driveway by parking a vehicle there and leaking a ton of oil which I had previously asked her to take care of and she hasn't.  This is also a 6-month-old house she has done this damage to.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I would just like her gone so I don't have to worry about theft of any more of my stuff or her randomly showing up at any hour of the night.

For context, I'm a 20 year old automotive photographer who has only been shooting cars professionally for under two years. Over the course of this time, I've shot hundreds of vehicles at events, rallys, singular glamour shots, etc. Note that I have done all of this work for FREE, and was doing it to build up a portfolio.

Recently my name in the automotive world has started to come to light, and I've had a few people reach out to me for paid gigs etc. One of these people owns an automotive 'coffee shop' and lounging area, where he wants to hang my work on the walls and sell it. I told him I love the idea however it would be far too much money for me to print/frame all these photographs myself, and would cost them $100+ per unit. They told me they understand and that they would much rather buy the RIGHTS to some of my photos and be able to print them on their own, so I wouldn't have to worry about that process. Now, this obviously raises a few concerns.

1) I would have to form some kind of contract that protects me and my work....

2) As I mentioned above, the cars I've shot were shot by me for FREE for either friends, random folks I found on instagram/facebook, events, etc. A majority of these people I don't have contact with anymore, and wonder if it would be an issue to even sell the RIGHTS of photographs taken of someone elses property... even if it's being sold as art.

In short, I have no idea what I'm doing and I don't want to make a huge mistake as a young artist to sell over the rights to my photographs and screw myself. I don't have any reason to believe these people have bad intentions, as they seemed like they wanted to have a long term relationship with me. I just want to make sure I tread lightly with this stuff.

So this started back in December as a leak above my shower. Maintenance took 2 months to ""fix"" it and in that time I started having asthma attacks and sinus infections. 

A couple weeks ago I was taking a shower when a thick layer of paint broke open and cold water went everywhere.  I found out their ""fix"" was painting over the issue and not fixing the leak.

After removing the thick layer of paint my entire bathroom ceiling was covered in black mold, cracked, and sinking in. I felt really sick (asthma, chronic migraines, sinuses, fatigue ect.) and asked multiple times for them to fix it.

2 weeks later they cut out my ceiling revealing moldy beams and insulation in my ceiling (to the point where it is actually eating away at the structure and smells as you would imagine). The maintenance man told me that, and I quote, ""Everywhere has mold, it can't make you sick,
 I took a class on it."" So they dont plan on fixing the mold issue past putting in a new ceiling. I'm scheduled to have it put in, which will cover all of the ""evidence"" of this mold issue.

I have been having so many health issues after my first few months living here that a month ago I resigned from my job because I constantly felt sick and didnt know why. Now I know.

Are there actions I can take to (quickly) get me out of this environment? My doctor agrees that I need to get away from this mold since I had allergy testing in the past and am very allergic. 

I also have documented (samples in bags, work order requests, pictures ect.) of all these events, I just dont know what to do. My lease isn't up for a few more months. I have no idea if there are even any laws to protect against mold. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

Got some news that I could actually file to stay so I called my insurance on JULY 2 to reinstate. Got a quote and told them I would be calling back next day (when I got paid) to start off again. It wxscaped my mind and I started a new job this morning. Figured I would go with the car and just call in to start the policy once I got there. Well, I was involved in an accident on the way over there and not sure how to go about with it. I have called to set up insurance but I know this doesn’t cover. Police were in scene and did not give me any tickets for insurance after I explained the situation, just for failing to produce and they said I could have it cleared once I got my policy. Now to the accident. I was coming out of a 4 way intersection in a residential area. Speed limit is 50kn I was going about 40. I had a yield sign and looked both ways, I could see a van on the horizon but far enough for me to move safely. (About 8 houses down).

Got some news that I could actually file to stay so I called my insurance on JULY 2 to reinstate. Got a quote and told them I would be calling back next day (when I got paid) to start off again. It wxscaped my mind and I started a new job this morning. Figured I would go with the car and just call in to start the policy once I got there. Well, I was involved in an accident on the way over there and not sure how to go about with it. I have called to set up insurance but I know this doesn’t cover. Police were in scene and did not give me any tickets for insurance after I explained the situation, just for failing to produce and they said I could have it cleared once I got my policy. Now to the accident. I was coming out of a 4 way intersection in a residential area. Speed limit is 50kn I was going about 40. I had a yield sign and looked both ways, I could see a van on the horizon but far enough for me to move safely. (About 8 houses down). I make it all the way through and next thing I know this van is sped up and slams right into me from my passenger side.

Two questions:

1.  I am not in the habit of getting speeding tickets, but isn't having a week between ticket and trial a bit... fast?  I thought the process took more like a month.

2.  I just started a new job, so I don't get paid until the 16th.  What do I do to set up a payment arrangement? Just call the court? I live a few hours away, so showing up isn't exactly feasible.  Do traffic players take payment arrangements? Do they generally require payment before, or after court?

Also, the fine amount isn't on the ticket, and I cannot find it on the court's website.  Any ideas on how much I owe?

1. Nothing has been filed (not legally separated either)

2. Cops were called Wednesday evening (by him, while drunk and probably high) and he was told to leave the house. 

3. What sort of evidence does she need to keep full custody of the kids ? How do she prove the anger issues, the drug and alcohol issues? The kids need to know their father, but she would like to have full custody with the most restrictions on him ..

4. She has money in her personal bank account that she wants to protect

5. She has a home and cars that she wants to protect. 

6. He lost his job recently and probably has no money to protect - so we think it’s going to get ugly. 


How can she protect her assets in this stage when nothing has been filed ?  Can she “gift” / “donate” that money to us for “investment” purposes (we have a legit reason)?  Can she put a good chunk of that money in a 529 plan (college savings ) for her kids?

I spend about $400 a month on her due to her mismanagement of funds. She overdrafts almost every month and doesn't understand how to budget. She also has physical and mental health issues. She has a history of leaving the ER and pulling out her IVs without being discharged. There have been incidents of her leaving pysch wards when being admitted voluntarily.

I got pulled over tonight in the car I bought from a dealership late last year for expired registration.  I have every paper in my glove box from my past 3 vehicles and their insurance, etc (no joke, it's stupid and I need to declutter that and be less paranoid about needing ancient paperwork), but do you think I could find my registration tonight?  Of course not, and that's on me.  But at the time of purchase (less than a year ago) the dealership took care of (or so I thought) the registration along with the title stuff.  I never received a renewal notice in the mail like I usually do, and by my calculations I shouldn't have expected to for a few months.  Registration has always been yearly.

So I check the paperwork from when I bought the car and they lumped the title and registration fees into one cost.  By checking my states DMV and related websites, I found that what they charged adds up to a year of registration plus the title fees.  I'm going to try to straighten this out tomorrow (today?  It was late driving home.), but I was wondering if anyone out there had any insight about why a vehicle would be registered for less than a year by the dealership anyway, especially if they're going to (seemingly?) charge for a whole year.  The way I see it, either I made an error somewhere, the dealership made an error, or the dealership is overcharging in their fees knowingly and are at least somewhat misleading about it, at least from where I'm standing now.  I fully own that I could have screwed something up, but if that's the case it's just not obvious to me at the moment.  I've never heard of registrations being for anything less than a year, so that's why I didn't ask about that at the time of purchase.

I checked my status with the DMV online and it says the same thing the officer told me.  I'm not young, I've never missed a renewal, inspection, etc ever.  I've never gotten so much as a speeding or parking ticket and I've been driving for decades, so you can maybe understand my stress and confusion here.

 Also, I only have 10 days to figure it out and plead guilty or not guilty, and three of them are the weekend after the 4th of the July so.....yeah.

It is a 2007.5 Dodge Ram 3500. Notorious for bad transmissions, I know that. Well, I got home, went to work with it and before I got to work the check engine light came on. I had to be at work, and could not call the dealer since they were closed and it was a Saturday, I could not call until Monday. In the meantime, I ran the codes. Something came up about the transmission fluid, OD control and MAP sensor. My brother is a diesel mechanic and advised to check the transmission fluid, and that it was probably the MAP sensor causing all my issues. I fill it with ATF, clear codes and keep dealer in the loop. Fast forward a few days, I find that it needs an oil change, I get the oil changed, and continue on with life, noticing the truck has trouble getting out of 1st and 3rd after driving it a while. I go to get some better tires on it, because they were pretty worn down when I got it, on the way home, check engine light comes on again. I continue on my way home, and the transmission fluid overheats and I have to wait an hour for it to cool down to continue home. I contact their mechanic again and start a week long wild goose chase to track him down, only for him to say that there is nothing wrong with the vehicle, and barely listens to my concerns or input. I did not like his input and contacted another dealership to actually diagnose the truck. Within 2 hours they call to tell me they fixed 2 recalls (Driver airbag, and driver airbag deployment mechanism), and that they caught the truck having trouble shifting, and upon further inspection the transmission fluid was burnt and that there was debris all over the transmission. Their recommendation is to replace the entire transmission. The dealership's warranty covers 25% labor and 25% parts. But I am thinking that is wrong, and that they should cover the entire repair bill. 

So my thoughts are, they should have inspected the vehicle to see if there was any recalls to repair and replace, and if they didn't couldn't they be liable for the drivers death?

My other issue, is that they either sold it with no mechanical inspection and sold a vehicle without knowing it was defective, or they sold a vehicle they knew had issues and sold it as perfectly functional. Secondly, their mechanic completely brushed me off, and only looked at the codes, he did no further inspections. What are some things I can do legally?

I have been living with a housemate for a month now and have signed a 3-month lease. He is very hostile towards me for no reason whatsoever and I have been trying to get him to mutually break the lease so that we both can move on.

Today, I had to move to an Airbnb temporarily because his brothers are visiting the city and will be staying in the condo for the weekend and he threatened me that they could get aggressive with me.

""They are a little gangster so if they get aggressive, angry or roudy, don't take it too harshly"" and then followed up with this message:

""Everybody that's coming already doesn't like you from stories so just prepare yourself""

He has agreed to return my last month's rent but I want him to return this month's rent as well because I do not want to live with him anymore considering the threats.

&amp;#x200B;

In the hardest point of my life so far, my father and best friend passed away from brain cancer in May. I'm the sole executor of his will and have a question regarding his taxes.

As executor, I've arranged and paid for his funeral, burial, and paid his credit cards debts with estate funds. The estate funds are now pretty much totally exhausted (there wasn't much to begin with). I have right of survivorship to his bank account, so I don't believe those are considered Estate Funds? The car was transferred into my name before he passed, and he didn't own a house (he was renting). 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently filed his taxes for 2018 and I was told that he owed 4400 dollars. This was a huge shock to me, and obviously not ideal. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my main question: Am I expected to pay his taxes out of my own pocket now that the estate funds have been cleared out paying for his funeral expenses and credit cards? That would seem crazy to me, but I wouldn't be surprised if they expected me to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Could anyone shine some light on this for me? If anyone needs anymore information to help them answer my question then please let me know, and i'll try my best to answer as transparently as possible.

The scammer asked me for my info such as full name, phone number, and address so that they would be able to send checks to me. I gave them that info, and then soon after had a medical emergency and contacted them to say I couldn't take the job after all. Despite that, the day after I was told they had sent me a check for $1960 USD to cover the cost of the shopping and errands I would be doing for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was also contacted the same day by the job site I had applied on saying this person was a scammer and somehow would steal my money if I deposited the check, and not to deposit the check or respond to them any further, which was fine with me because like I said, I'd already backed out due to being sick. However, I didn't respond to any more of the scammer's emails including the one about sending me a check. The next day, they texted me saying hello, still acting professional. Today, I got another text saying they'll report me to the police if I don't respond. I'm not sure what for, maybe the fact that they sent a big check to me and I suspiciously stopped replying to them. I don't know what kinds of things you can report for exactly on this topic.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I let them know I am aware that they're trying to scam me? I'm worried that if they report me to the police, I will somehow get caught up in some kind of legal mess because of a misunderstanding on the police's part since I am still very ill and haven't gone back home yet, so I can't even retrieve the check from my mail to destroy it or go to the police station with it.

I have went to their police department and talked to the captain about this and he agreed that if he were in that situation, he would have marked it as a corrections to just fix the issue not stating it as “altered”. The captain told me that this was not going to be solved unless I go to court. I am planning to go, but I just needed to know your thoughts on.&lt;/p&gt;

My best friend and the time agreed I'd take over her lease May 1st. April 13th we get into a heated argument, as I'm leaving her apartment she tells me she doesn't want me moving into her apartment anymore. This gives me 2 weeks to find another place to live and since I don't have any family here I could bunk with so I scramble to find a new place. I was really upset after the argument as she said some unforgivable, extremely hurtful things to me, therefore I didn't want to contact her. I did leave her multiple ways to contact me (facebook, instagram, email) in case she wanted to discuss the apartment. The only reason she couldn't text me is because I got a new phone and new number. 

April 29th (the day she's moving out) she messages me saying she didn't know I wasn't moving into her apartment and I owe her $1050 in rent. I DID NOT sign a lease, live in her apartment or pay any amount of rent, which according to Manitoba tenancy laws means I can't be held accountable to pay the rent. Furthermore, since I never applied, I was never approved to take over the apartment so there is no way I should be held accountable for paying rent. I went to a legal centre who drafted up a letter asking her to retract her claim which she did not. 

I'm very concerned she's forged some sort of texts, messages, photos or something because why else would she go through with a claim that she has no chance of winning? I'm completely anxiety ridden thinking she may have forged texts or something of that sort.

Hi so I made an account just to ask this. And would much appreciate any insight.

So I used to be Friends with 2 guys who decided to house share together let's call friend A hank and friend B Chris. Hank is one of my close friends and I know he struggles mentally with health issues and I have been worried for him in the past. Chris I thought of as a friend but I have revised that opinion.

So hank moves in with Chris and they decide to go into shared accommodation and I'm pretty sure they have a joint tenancy. Hank later gets into a fight with Chris over some dirty sh** that Chris pulled. Hank decides to move out and hands in notice that he won't be living there anymore and Chris decides that he can't afford to live there anymore so tells hank he will move out.

Very recently I met hank looking like he has lost hope and he tells me that Chris is refusing to acknowledge that he is moving out and so the landlord is still charging hank for living there and so hank is having to work overtime for a house he isn't even living in and Chris is living happily with hank having to foot the bill.

I'm very worried for hank's mental health and I fear that he might eventually end up doing what people do when they give up hope completely.

Sorry this is so long winded guys but my question is if my friend hank did one day do that as a result of what Chris did can i get Chris in legal trouble for it? Is there a case against him? I feel like he would have contributed massively to the decline in hank's mental health and so is responsible. Obviously I will do everything I can to make sure hank never does such a thing but if it were to happen I want to know what I should be doing.

My current situation is this:

A sister of mine borrowed money months ago close to the beginning of the year, and had said she would pay me back once she started her new job in January, so I thought I would be nice and help her out. The problem being she asked for $1500, and I am a broke college student, so that was a decent amount of my own savings. A couple months after that, she calls me up and asks for more money. Again, stupid me says sure, because she told me she would have it back to me in two days after she got paid, she just needed it that day for a down-payment on something. I paid her $2000 in total, and about a week later I texted her to ask if she had ever made a transfer back to my account, and she just never replied. I still haven't talked to her since (so a few months at this point) but she maintains regular contact with our father, not our mother, because she owes her money too. Is there anything legal I can do about this? I was dumb and didn't have her sign any papers before transferring the money, but I still have the transfer record in my account with her name and account number on it.

Any advice is welcome and much appreciated

&lt;p&gt;My current situation is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sister of mine borrowed money months ago close to the beginning of the year, and had said she would pay me back once she started her new job in January, so I thought I would be nice and help her out. The problem being she asked for $1500, and I am a broke college student, so that was a decent amount of my own savings. A couple months after that, she calls me up and asks for more money. Again, stupid me says sure, because she told me she would have it back to me in two days after she got paid, she just needed it that day for a down-payment on something. I paid her $2000 in total, and about a week later I texted her to ask if she had ever made a transfer back to my account, and she just never replied.

My 1 1 month old recently had a routine surgery.  Because they can’t eat after midnight on the day of surgery, he was scheduled at 6:30am to get it over with asap.  So, it was an early morning without much sleep the night before.  My husband and I were nervous about the surgery and really unable to focus on much else.

When we got to the hospital we checked him on, got the little bracelet for his wrist, they made us sign all the waivers and all of that, and then they told us our copay was almost $2,600.  I nearly fell out of my seat.  We have pretty good insurance and I had expected it to be closer to $300.00.  I was holding an upset baby and honestly not able to take it all in.  I just handed over our credit card which in hindsight was pretty dumb.

Later that day when we were back home I called insurance and they confirmed that I was right, it should’ve been closer to $300.00.  So, long story short I’ve called the hospital and billing and insurance and basically just been blown off.  I’m sure eventually we’ll see a refund but it’s been a month already and they are saying it could take a lot longer.  Meanwhile we just paid the credit card off to avoid interest but that’s a significant amount of money for our family to be out while we wait for it to be resolved.

Back in February I applied to Chase digitally for a credit transfer and declined their offer because it was not enough to cover my entire credit card debt with Capital One. I selected ""decline"" on the online form and went about my life. Chase went ahead and did the transfer of debt anyways, now today my account is very defaulted as I didn't know it existed. Chase is claiming they could not reach out to me to tell me that my account was starting to default because they didn't have my contact information because get this, I never completed any of their transfer forms. Chase is also claiming they sent me a letter letting me know they were going to do the transfer anyways. I never got it.

I've spent countless hours on the phone with them trying to get it sorted out but just get scripted person after scripted person. I've finally wiggled up to their ""executive office"" where they said they were sorry and would put the transfer back to my Caption One card. The transfer amount only (no late fees) went back to my Capital One card on June 17th, but is still in my chase account as well. When I called the executive office back , Luke let me know they decided not to do the transfer back because they have done nothing wrong and said they didn't put it back on my Capital One card. I called Capital One to confirm, its there. Luke says he is ""looking into it"" every time I call and ask for an update. Luke also let me know no late fees would be taken off my account, my minimum payment is still due on the 6th of this month and he threw in a bonus, ""Its not my fault you didn't read the letter"" jab.

I'm honestly not sure where to go from here. I was just trying to better my credit debt and now its doubled and my credit score has suffered greatly. My payment to chase is due tomorrow, should I bite the bullet and pay the min so my credit doesn't suffer or should I continue to hold off since the debt technically shouldn't even be there anymore since its back in my original account?

First time poster here. This is an ongoing situation so I’m sorry for lack of details

I work in a store in a pretty popular mall in. It’s been extremely humid in the state of Maryland for the past few days and as such, outdoor stairs are pretty slippery in the morning.

I parked in my usual spot in the garage closest to my store. The stairs I fell down are known for being pretty treacherous when wet and there’s almost never any wet floor signs except for the few times a month they power wash them. 

I was walking down the last flight and fell pretty hard causing a pretty severe bruise (possible break, X-rays aren’t back yet) to my forearm and minor injury to my lower back. I’ve filed an incident report with the security office, but I’d love some advice from anyone who has filed a suit about personal injury against a large company like a mall?

Maybe language like this is just boiler plate :

if I've already signed a C&amp;A with my real (pays me) employer  does that trump this one? Does this expect me to disclose what I'm doing in my day job (I know that's absurd, but legally speaking) ?

I feel very stuck. I've asked them to get a new housemate to replace me, they said no. I asked them to break the tenancy altogether (something the landlord has offered to us already) and they said no. 

I can't just leave as I'd still be liable for my 1/3 of the rent. 

At the moment I'm sleeping on a friend's sofa. I don't feel safe to be in the house. I'm really not sure what to do. 

Can anyone suggest a legal and fair escape route? Also don't want it to be the case where I'm making them both homeless all of a sudden. 

My friend now refuses to discuss the matter and is completely ignoring me. His friend, the one I dated, refuses to talk without everything blowing up and it turning into a huge argument, often leading to violence. 

I suffer with mental health issues if that changes any level of help I can get. 

I really need to be out of the house.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys,à&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

 We recently gave our 30-day notice for terminating our lease on a month-to-month tenancy. Our landlord sent us a message today asking us to make sure that our house is spotless and in the same condition it was delivered to us by the end of the 30 days, and confidently promised to charge us for each day that the unit is unoccupied after our lease expires while the place undergoes necessary cleaning/repairs. This seems absurd to me for the following reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I understand correctly, California law allows normal wear and tear without penalizing tenants after a tenancy ends. We have been here for over a year, and naturally there are wear-and-tear marks on the house (e.g. scuff marks from shoes on a wooden floor, hard-to-remove bits of grease residue on stove, etc.). Therefore, it is bizarre that he is asking for the place in mint condition given that it had just been renovated when we arrived.
2. If what the landlord is threatening is legally defensible, it would seem to imply that a landlord could simply claim that every day that a unit isn't rented was the result of the previous tenants' minor wear and tear to a house. 
3. Even if a unit were absolutely trashed, the landlord's claim implies the landlord could delay cleaning for months and continue charging the previous tenant simply because the trash delayed the signing of new tenants onto a new lease for months. 

If our landlord determines that we have damaged or trashed the unit (which we do not believe we have or will do), isn't the landlord's legal recourse to deduct the cost of the repairs/cleaning itself from our security deposit, and not this weird extra rent for each day the house remains damaged/trashed? 

It seems to me that the only amount we are obligated to pay is that of the cost of cleaning or repairs **beyond normal wear/tear,** and not the rent that would be owed for the number of days that the unit remains in a worse condition than how it was received by us over a year ago. Is this correct?

This included forced sexual acts (genital touching, oral, penetration), sexual comments towards me, harrassment (i.e forcing me to strip naked, pulling my towel off after getting out of the shower, etc), being made to watch pornography and groping. I also endured physical abuse during these episodes, mainly hitting/punching, biting and strangulation. 

At 14 I finally came forward about the abuse, and separated myself from my father's household. I told the therapist I was seeing at the time, who made a mandatory police report. I was called in for questioning afterwards, but the questioning process was so traumatic for me that I couldn't continue filing the report. I've gone the past years too afraid and exhausted to go back and reopen my case. I begun to reconsider after the therapist I'm seeing now asked about my case, and questioned whether or not I thought it plausible my abuser might hurt another child. He also informed me a statue of limitations wouldn't affect my case in the event I reconsidered pressing charges.

The abuse has left me significantly mentally unwell. I am still suffering from depression, self harm, anxiety, mild substance abuse issues and CPTSD. I've made multiple attempts on my own life, and have been hospitalized for both a suicide attempt and self mutilation. In the past (while I was still living with my abuser) I had also suffered from a moderate-severe eating disorder which I've since recovered from. The trauma and it's effects on my mental health make it difficult to function in my day to day life, and I constantly live in fear of coming across my abuser. I don't know if I would consider them a pedophile, but I can't say with confidence that they wouldn't abuse another child.

One of my main issues with pressing charges/applying for a restraining order or peace bond is that I don't have much substantial evidence. The physical evidence is long gone, and while I believe they took sexual photos of me as a child I have no evidence to back that up. The only sort of ""evidence"" I can think of is that, after being confronted by my father, they admitted to abusing me (and tried to justify the abuse by claiming I, a 10 year old, initiated the acts lol). I'm also concerned my case won't be taken seriously as we're both biologically female. 

Is this even worth pursuing? Just the thought of this person roaming the streets scot free has kept me an anxiety riddled mess for almost a decade, but I feel powerless to do anything to lock them up or at the very least keep them away from me. My mental health continues to degrade while they're just out living their life and it makes me sick. What if they do abuse another kid and I did nothing to prevent it? I'm still somewhat under the assumption I won't be believed or taken seriously by authorities, but it's beginning to seem more worth it to at least make an attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 3rd year computer science student In Irvine, California and I was recently hired at a job that has tasked me with writing a web application. The main issue I am having is that I didn't actually sign up for that job. When I came in for my first day, I was told that I would be writing this application along with another new hire, who also did not know that this is what he would be doing. The job was advertised as a mentor for younger students to teach them robotics and programming, with no mention of developing software for the company. The job was also stated to pay 12 dollars an hour, paid at the end of each month, but my boss mentioned that I would instead be paid whenever the project was done for about 1k total. I expect this project to take at least 30 hours a week for a month to finish, if not more, so basic math shows that they are paying me less than minimum wage to complete this project. On top of all of this, my partner does not have the necessary skills to develop an application such as this, and I can't blame him, because he was just thrust into a job that he was unprepared to take on.

Another aspect of this that is concerning is that I have not signed any paperwork. No contract or anything, which means that I don't know how much I will be getting paid, and there is no guarantee that there even be compensation when the app is finished. I am also unsure if I am legally employed here or not.

A dilemma that I am having is that I actually want to develop the app, as it would be an excellent addition to my resume, and it is good practice for what I want to do in the future. However, I feel as if I am possibly being used by the company to develop software for less money than they should pay.

I intend to talk with my boss about it tomorrow, and I will see what I can work out, but I also wanted to see if anyone here can give me advice on what to do. I have some more information about the process through which I was interviewed and hired, but this post is already long enough, so if you would like me to elaborate on that, I would be happy to in the comments.

Not sure about the legality of this situation but I just started working for a tow truck impound a couple weeks ago. Yesterday I had a customer come in to pick up his vehicle that was impounded and he paid by visa. When the visa slip prints it usually has an authorization code but this one didn't have one. It was our busy time of day so I just kept going as I thought maybe it was a fluke or something and released the vehicle to him. My manager informed me today that the transaction never went through and it stated that on the receipt that printed (I've never had to look at that area of the receipt before) and informed me that it would be coming out of my paycheque unless I was able to get ahold of him and convince him to come back in and pay for the impound. So now I'm looking at having $280 taken out of my paycheque which means I will struggle to be able to afford my rent this month. Apparently this isn't the first time this has happened and some people have been held responsible for bills upwards of $1300. I realize I made a mistake that cost the company money but the fact that there is no forgiveness for this or that they can dock my pay feels insane. I've never worked at a place that had a policy like this in place before. For context this seems like a pretty shady business, the sort of place that impounds vehicles and after 60 days the vehicle is owned by the company and whoever the registered owner of the vehicle is has a bill upwards of $5000 sent to collections. Any advice on this matter would be appreciated, even if it boils down to sucking it up and absorbing the cost and trying to get inventive to stretch my money for rent.

I live in a small town in Nova Scotia. I have a two bedroom apartment with my girlfriend and dog. 

My downstairs neighbour, a man around seventy always  throws garbage and food on the lawn. It is a regular occurrence since I moved here and there has been numerous complaints already made about it since before I had lived here as well. The landlord isn’t ever around so nothing is done about it. 

Yesterday, I had an incident with the downstairs neighbour. I picked up the garbage on the lawn and put it on his step to deal with. He came outside yelling and telling me to fuck myself. I asked the man what his problem is, and he shoved me and said he’s going to “make me a fucking cripple”. He takes a step back and grabs a baseball bat from behind his door. He raises it up, and I grab it from his hands. I tell him he’s a nut job and I’m calling the cops (big mistake).

So I call, but he did too and claimed I threatened him. When I talked to the cops I gave them back the geezers bat since I didn’t want the thing. No idea if they gave it back.  I hope not but yeah. He wasn’t charged or anything. 

So, if I let him hit me would it be assault but since i took it from him he doesn’t get charged? I don’t understand and I’m frustrated because this old cunt still lives downstairs. Im not scared of him but I am concerned he’ll fuck with my girlfriend, my dog, or my car. I can’t be here 100% of the time.

i have been in my rental for 4years now. about a year ago, i spoke to the building manager about flooring damage in my bathroom. he took a pic, mentioned he'd address it to the landlord who lives on site as does he, and no follow up.

i've since covered up the bathroom with rugs, and now have noticed the damage has gotten worse- water damage, and some cracking in floor. i know the floor is going to have to be replaced. i'm not sure if it would be all the bathroom floor or just that half where the damage is. it's a small small bathroom. i'm in the bay area (CA) 

my question is - would i be liable for the costs ? even after their negligence to repair it prior to it getting worse?  is it a better idea to bring it up again before i move out? my deposit is only 700$ which is half the rent, so i assume i could be billed for more ?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

The balloon scraps are on a lot of people’s driveways. And it looks like a lot of work to pick it up (we’re talking almost 15 kids with hundreds of scraps). Is there anything I can do besides just telling them to stop and scolding them, since they’ve increased HOA fees?

Background, I work in the halloween horror industry, and have been working with this attraction since 2014, fast forward to March of 2019. We receive notice that this year, our attraction will not be opening up this year(due to budget concerns, and location issues). Going through our contract, I see that we signed a non-compete agreement that last for one year from the last date of employment(late October of 2018), and says we are not to work with another company within a distance of 60 miles of said attraction(new attraction is approximately 59.6 miles away). This is a small company with there being two owners, two managers, and a staff of around 50ish without a halloween job this year.

Personally, I would want to work at this new location, since it is a seasonal job that works well with my schedule and can help me earn some extra money right before the holiday season, and its a fun job that leads into some really awesome opportunities during the off season.

My question is,

1. Do I still have to follow that non-compete agreement since company is no longer in operations?
2. What could the punishment be if said owner found out I did break our non compete?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Missouri)&lt;br/&gt;

And all substances which equal to over 0.2 blood alcohol content is considered DUI.

After court i was sentenced to have my drivers right revoked for 10 months.

But the police removed the “block” on my drivers lissence 1 month after i should have been removed. So i was basiclly given 1 month longer sentence.

They refused and they basiclly said they did nothing wrong.

Also during the case was open i asked  the police to come and see the documents in the case. Because i dident have money for a lawyer i had to defend myself.

I wanted to see if any of the evidence was illegaly obtained ao i could ask the court to cut them out as evidence against me.

The police forced me to open my iphone with my fingers. so i wanted to see if they had the right “orders” that allows them to use force.

The police dident give me acsess to view the documents and evidence against me until after the case was closed.

I have been living at home with my parents without a formal contract between us. The general consensus is that I pay $450 a month, plus my own car insurance and other expenses. Health insurance, it’s cheapest (for my mother and myself) for me to be on her health insurance. Gas, I pay for, and car insurance I pay for (to my parents. 300$ cash), though I have no vehicle of my own and am allowed to borrow my father’s truck (which has been promised, ‘given’, offered for purchase) or the family vehicle. Utilities are included in my parent’s rent of the apartment. I pay for my own groceries and do my own cooking. I do not pay for phone expenses and they refuse to allow me to despite my requests to be able to— I believe as a control method, as they request their phone back for any misbehavior. I do not pay for internet either, as it’s bundled with the landline. 

There are always miscellaneous expenses tacked on to the end of month — I left a dish or two in the sink 10$, I didn’t clean the cat box daily 10$, etc — and my rent is due a month behind.  So I pay for June’s rent at the start of July. I tried to keep track, only to be yelled at for “nitpicking” and told, emphatically, I am incorrect, no matter how carefully I track. In April, I tried to pay extra one month so I would, like the rest of the world, pay for the upcoming month. 

Miraculously, by the end of the month, I managed to rack up $450 in miscellaneous expenses (that I don’t remember ever doing, and they could not give more than vague explanations) and was back to paying a month behind, and any attempts to explain otherwise have been met with solid resistance. I am not given a receipt because “we’re family” and it’s cash because it’s easiest for them. 

I have been uneasy for years about this situation, as I was kicked out at 17 for a week for going to prom in a tux, and I do not trust them. At all. 

I want to know the legality, for certain, of a number of things. Sorry if they are stupid questions, but I can’t exactly ask my parents. 

1. I was not allowed time to read the lease of the apartment (between tenants and the landlords of the apartment) because my parents pressured me. I’m not sure of how to prove that, if I can at all. This has occurred every year since I became an adult tenant. 
2. They’re not on the up and up with my rent, are they? I am pretty sure about this but would like confirmation. 
3. Is there a way to request a copy of my lease from my landlord? Just ask them, or is there a more involved process?
4. Is there a legally viable way to keep track of the money I give them, or would it be a he-said-she-said situation? As of this moment I have a list, and bank statements confirming the amounts removed, but I don’t believe those are adequate. 
5. Am I at risk of being evicted for non payment of rent, if my parents claim I haven’t paid? This is my biggest concern.

It has been a great accomplishment for me personally and it quickly felt like home. It’s a renovated home in an area of town that is being gentrified and home prices are literally skyrocketing year over year. We just got a Whole Foods in the area and if there are tons of studies about how that affects prices as well. That’s the good stuff.

Now to the reason I’m here. One month after moving in (February) I had to replace a portion of my roof due to leaks in the master bathroom. Neither the seller or home inspector took any responsibility for this. The contractor used, mentioned the roof accessories and installation was done very poorly and should not have passed inspection. None the less I took this $3K cost in the chin and paid it expecting it to be a single incident.

Fast forward a few months, there is water damage to the carpet of the basement. First off it makes no sense to have carpet in a moist area but there is. Because of this and other intrusions there is mold there as well. To add to the laundry list there is also water damage in both of my bathrooms as the plumbing was not properly installed. Lastly (I know it’s a lot) I just got done spending another $4K fixing a sewage leak that literally had sewage exiting into my backyard.

At this point I’ve spent $7K in less than 6 months and am about to spend a bit more to fix the bathrooms and basement / mold. My insurance should assist with some of this but that still isn’t the point. I had the home inspected from a referral from my realtor and absolutely none of these defects were made known to me before buying or in a sellers disclosure statement. 

Lastly, I know there is often a question of “How much did the seller or renovation team know?” Two quick things here. I recently found an old beat up floor fan in an unfinished room of my basement that the construction team left behind. Now why would you have one of those? Also, for the sewage, the plumbing team took pictures of multiple configurations that don’t meet code (I’m not technical, but they have to do with L sharped turns, materials used, literally jamming a pipe into a broken pipe, and finally connecting my line to my neighbors).

Quite the list I know - and not a great first time home buying experience. Literally nothing surprises me about how shitty of a job the renovation team/ seller did in this home anymore. Please advise or let me know if any good lawyers that have won cases similar to this.


TLDR; Bought home in January, replaced roof (3K) in February and now replacing water damaged bathrooms, sewage pipes, and water damage/ mold in basement in June/ July. Total lying in over 10K and counting be spent in less than 6 months.

It’s a renovated home in an area of town that is being gentrified and home prices are literally skyrocketing year over year. We just got a Whole Foods in the area and if there are tons of studies about how that affects prices as well. That’s the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to the reason I’m here. One month after moving in (February) I had to replace a portion of my roof due to leaks in the master bathroom. Neither the seller or home inspector took any responsibility for this. The contractor used, mentioned the roof accessories and installation was done very poorly and should not have passed inspection. None the less I took this $3K cost in the chin and paid it expecting it to be a single incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few months, there is water damage to the carpet of the basement. First off it makes no sense to have carpet in a moist area but there is. Because of this and other intrusions there is mold there as well. To add to the laundry list there is also water damage in both of my bathrooms as the plumbing was not properly installed. Lastly (I know it’s a lot) I just got done spending another $4K fixing a sewage leak that literally had sewage exiting into my backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I’ve spent $7K in less than 6 months and am about to spend a bit more to fix the bathrooms and basement / mold. My insurance should assist with some of this but that still isn’t the point. I had the home inspected from a referral from my realtor and absolutely none of these defects were made known to me before buying or in a sellers disclosure statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I know there is often a question of “How much did the seller or renovation team know?” Two quick things here. I recently found an old beat up floor fan in an unfinished room of my basement that the construction team left behind. Now why would you have one of those? Also, for the sewage, the plumbing team took pictures of multiple configurations that don’t meet code (I’m not technical, but they have to do with L sharped turns, materials used, literally jamming a pipe into a broken pipe, and finally connecting my line to my neighbors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite the list I know - and not a great first time home buying experience. Literally nothing surprises me about how shitty of a job the renovation team/ seller did in this home anymore. Please advise or let me know if any good lawyers that have won cases similar to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; Bought home in January, replaced roof (3K) in February and now replacing water damaged bathrooms, sewage pipes, and water damage/ mold in basement in June/ July. Total lying in over 10K and counting be spent in less than 6 months. Looking for advice for how to proceed legally and if anyone has faced similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;

We both want to separate but have been living together in TN for 6 months while she finds a steady job and somewhere else to live.  I had a lot of assets pre-marriage in another state, but when we got married, we moved to TN and we purchased a home with those out-of-state, pre-marital assets.  It's in my name only and only my pre-marital assets purchased it-- but my wife does the laundry every now and then, so I assume that means it won't be equitably distributed 0% to her.

There is no pre-nuptial agreement, when we were first married I was the only partner with assets, and I just assumed if things went awry I would be able to divide those from marital.  My mistake.

I own the TN house outright; it's valued around $300k.  We are currently planning an uncontested divorce with a marital separation agreement prepared online (we plan to consult a lawyer and CPA jointly) where I would buy her out for about 25% of the worth of the home:  $50k in a one time payment at the time of the divorce, and $500/month alimony over 5 years (or however the lawyer advises/structures it).  I am not flush with cash at the moment, most of my wealth/money is tied up in the equity of our home.

My wife is currently, secretly dating another man.  Should I just blow that off because I am getting a good deal at un-contesting the divorce with a 25% buyout or is it worth it to look into contesting the divorce and getting her to settle for less:  I'm thinking 10%.  She is also getting a car that is the result of an insurance payment during our marriage.  I plan to keep mine [EDIT:(pre-marital asset)].  They are equal in value.

What are my options?  Play it cool and coast to uncontested divorce land with a 25% wealth hit, or consult an attorney on the side?  I'm nervous if I don't retain the attorney I consult with, someone will mysteriously advise my wife to contest the divorce so she could attempt to get more money.  I assume she's getting a worse deal at 25%, and I am lucky that she is not contesting.

My bf's ex-wife has said that she has filed for divorce and that her process server has attempted to serve him at our adrdress but out property manager (apartments) has escorted him off the premesis. No one has contacted us (server or apartments saying any such thing). Then she said that he left a card, but we haven't seen one. They (my bf and his ex) had previously talked and agreed upon a deadline for serving because of monteary issues, but she has basically taken his kids ""hostage"" and won't let him see them (presumably until she gets a court order for child support). He has been asking for them every weeekend so that he has proof of her keeping them from him for their court date (not scheduled), and we think this might just be a ploy for her to have some textual evidence that she's trying to get everything legalized on the up and up for when they do have a court date.

He has been asking for them every weeekend so that he has proof of her keeping them from him for their court date (not scheduled), and we think this might just be a ploy for her to have some textual evidence that she&amp;#39;s trying to get everything legalized on the up and up for when they do have a court date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With  some initial investigation it looks like servers have some pretty sneaky ways of &amp;quot;trapping&amp;quot; my bf to serve him, but we&amp;#39;ve not been contacted at all. (She has a history of lying and manipulation, but we&amp;#39;re going  to assume that she&amp;#39;s telling the truth on this one because it would be on us if she did and we just didn&amp;#39;t believe her.) My bf is going to talk to an attorney asap, but with the fourth of july weekend, it will probably be Monday before he can talk to anyone. Is there anything we can do to prove that we haven&amp;#39;t been contacted or prove that she may be lying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I thought about was that we could call the apartment office, which should be open on Friday 7/5. Other than that, I&amp;#39;m clueless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice is helpful. State is TX.&lt;/p&gt;

This will be hard to explain I think, I'm sorry  

My job (which is all commission) changed their pay structure in January. 
They began paying out less commissions due, but offering 6 goals that if met, would give you chances to earn certain percentages of your commissions due back. 

One of those categories is getting people to sign up for our monthly drawings. If you get X% of your customers  to sign up, you get .25% of your commission as a ""bonus""
They have not given us the drawing slips for 3 months now. Which means for 3 months we have not had the chance to earn that ""bonus"" percentage back. 

They also since January, started these quizzes that if you pass them, you get a bonus every month for being certified on that level. Since January, I have been told I couldn't take the level 1 quiz because the regional manager responsible for giving them doesn't have time to test people.  
Today, we had nothing but time and she was in the store so I asked if we could do it. 
She then informs me that there has never been a quiz. That she never wrote one up, therefore she doesn't have one to give me today. 
In SIX+ MONTHS that this pay structure has been active, there has not even been the option to advance in it. 
I feel like I am owed the .25% of the commissions being held against this incentive, as it is in no way my fault that I do not have that certification. 
Same goes for the 3 months ive been unable to get sign-ups. 

Am I wrong? I feel like I am being scammed and lied to so the owners can roll in cash.

I forgot to get my 900 bike in all the mess, yeah still kicking myself over that. I tried messaging them all day from different different phones yesterday and they ignored me until I threatened to call the police. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were all friends and there is no lease we signed or anything. I chose to leave they did not evict me without notice. When they finally answered they basically admitted that they had time to give it to me earlier but chose not to and to ignore me instead. They basically said you can come get your bike when we feel like giving you the bike because it’s not our fault you left it, it’s not my problem. One of them I know was home when me and my cousin went to to knock, he just chose not to answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways one of them said he will be able to give it back today at 7pm, but I’m very skeptical. I really don’t feel comfortable going alone and am wondering if I can get an officer to accompany me.&lt;/p&gt;

My apologies for an unexciting post, but my friend and I are working for the first time with a lawyer on a injury case with a contingency fee agreement, and as this is all new and kind of intimidating to us, it'd mean a lot to have anyone take a quick look at some of the text in the agreement to see if there's anything unusual or questionable in it...

I've pasted in what seems like the most relevant parts below, and would be deeply grateful for any input! This is for a case being handled in Los Angeles, California.

\------

**Services** **to** **be** **Performed** **by** **Attorney**\*\*:\*\* Attorney agrees to perform the following legal services with respect to  the Claim(s) described above: (1) investigation of Claim{s}; (2) legal analysis and determining responsible parties; and (3) settlement  demands,  procedures,  and negotiations. If  Attorney  determines it  is appropriate,Attorney also agrees to perform the following legalservices: (4} prosecution of Claim(s} by arbitration or legal action until settlement, award or judgment  is obtained; and (5) if judgment is obtained in Client's favor, opposing an opposing  party's motion  for  new trial (if any). Attorney is authorized to  associate or employ, at Attorney's expense (at no additional expense to Client}, other counsel to assist in performing the services required by this Agreement.

**Contingency** **Fee** **to** **Attorney**\*\*:\*\*Client acknowledges he/she has been advised by Attorney and is aware that any contingency fee arrangements are not set by law and that a contingency fee between Attorney and which initial costs are borne by Attorney at his ***risk,*** ***time,*** and ***expense,*** and therefore, Attorney not Client, has sole discretion to  pursue Client's Claim(s} in  any manner he deems appropriate. (For example, Client has no authority to demand Attorney argue a motion against Attorney's advice, draft letters,or perform other legal work at Client's behest.) Bearing in mind that  the contingency fee is negotiable, Client agrees to  pay Attorney  a contingency fee as a share of any recovery, as follows:

**30%** OF AllFUNDS RECOVERED BEFORE A LAWSUIT IS FILED.

**35%** OF ALL FUNDS RECOVERED  AFTER  A  LAWSUIT  IS FILED BUT BEFORE  THE FINAL STATUS CONFERENCE, PRETRIAL OR TRIAL SETTING CONFERENCE.

**40%**  THEREAFTER, UP TO AND INCLUDING JUDGMENT.

Client agrees the arrangement above is fair and reasonable. In the event that Client is a minor at the time the Recovery is obtained, or if the case is one where attorney's fees are limited or otherwise established by Law, the fee shall be the maximum portion of the recovery that the law or a Court allows. Client consents to Attorney requesting a fee in accordance with the above schedule.

(a) **Costs** **and** **Expenses** **as** **Affecting** **Contingency** **Fee:** Client agrees to pay a **$250** Administrative Flat Cost out of any settlement, which includes ordinary copying costs, telephone charges and postage fees. Client also agrees to pay all costs and disbursements incurred by Attorney as reasonably required for investigation and prosecution of Client's Claim. This includes, without limitation, process service fees, charges for depositions and court reporters, investigators and special copying of documents, jury fees, fees for translators or interpreters, fees for expert witnesses and consultants, lay witness fees, messenger and delivery service, air freight, computerized research, videotape  recording,  travel  (including  mileage,  parking,  airfare,  lodging,  meals  and  ground transportation}, long  distance telephone, word  processing, court  costs, filing  fees, and other  miscellaneous expenses associated with the pursuit of your Claims. Costs and expenses paid in connection with Client's Claim shall be reimbursed before the contingency fee is computed. Client's share of the recovery shall be the balance remaining after reimbursement of such costs and expenses and payment of the contingency fee.

(b) **Sanctions** **Awards** **Not** **Part** **of** **Recovery**\*\*:\*\*Monetary sanctions awarded to Attorney during the course of any litigation  shall not be considered part of Client's recovery in this action. Such sanctions shall be deemed compensation to counsel for extraordinary time and effort expended as a result of an opposing party's bad faith conduct or failure to comply with discovery demands, court orders or similar obligations. But if the sanctions award includes a cost item (such as the filing fee for making a motion}. the amount thereof shall be credited to Client's costs account.

(c) **Fee** **Award** **By** **Court** **Not** **a** **Limit** **on** **Contingency** **Fee:** Any fee awarded by the court, pursuant to statute or contract, in connection with the subject matter of this representation, shall be paid to Attorney and shall be applied against Client's fee obligation  under this Agreement, but  shall not  limit  or discharge Client's fee obligation.

**7.**  **Litigation** **Costs** **and** **Expenses:** Attorney is authorized to incur reasonable costs and expenses in performing legal services under this Agreement. Client agrees to pay for such costs and expenses in addition  to the contingency fee discussed above.

**8.**  **Client's** **Responsibility** **Regarding** **Costs** **and** **Medical** **Liens**\*\*:\*\* Attorney may advance such costs and expenses on Client's behalf but is not obligated to do so.Client agrees to reimburse Attorney upon demand for any such advances. Client is responsible for such reimbursement regardless of the status or outcome of the litigation, or the amount of any recovery. Further Client is also responsible for all outstanding **medical** **liens** for treatment Client received related to Client's Claim(s} notwithstanding any outcome.

**10.**  **Power** **of**  **Attorney** **to**  **Settle**\*\*:\*\* Client hereby gives Attorney  a Special Power of  Attorney  to endorse and sign Client's name to any document, contract, release, or check relating to the case for which this Agreement is given, provided that Client has failed to communicate with Attorney or respond to communications sent to Client's last known address for a period of at least thirty {90) days. This shall be used to expedite Client's case when Client is not readily available, and Attorney  is further  authorized to  deposit Client's share of  any monetary recovery in Attorney's Client Trust Account to be turned over to Client when available.

My friend recently moved into an apartment in Virginia and noticed a funny smell.  They initially didn’t think much of it. But his wife has asthma and started getting sick.  He is also sick now with sinus symptoms and they have gotten worse so they had to move out and go to hotel.

Someone has come to take the wall down and they saw what appears to be black mold but the person said he or she could not officially say that it’s mold. 

Apparently the landlord said that there was prior water damage which she initially said was treated by a licensed professional.   It turns out she verbally admitted that she didn’t use any professional to treat the mold. 

My friend is sick and wants to get out of the lease but he is afraid to be on the hook for the rest of the lease terms

Lease terms say he has to pay till the end of the term.  My research shows that the landlord has to make an effort to rent the place even if he breaks the lease on his own accord and that he would only be responsible for the amount covering the time the apartment unrented.

I found this to be the relevant law/ordinance.


https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title55/chapter13.2/section55-248.25/

Can my friend get out of the lease because of the mold causing it to be unlivable?  

Does he have to give the landlord time to fix it?  She is out of town for 4th of July at the moment.

Can he be reimbursed for the other costs of finding a motel or medical issues?

I live in Illinois and I have a question about a situation that I am currently going through.   


I was in a major car accident and needed surgery. I informed my employer about the accident at the scene. They got the ball rolling for me and began my Short Term Disability through the insurance that I purchased through my employer. Once I was out of the hospital I kept in contact with my employers HR department and kept updated on the progress of my healing with them. As time went on I was evident that I was going to need to file for Long Term Disability through my employers insurance.

I received a simple questionnaire, the LTD Packet, and then my employer needed a statement from my doctor on their companies letterhead stating the severity of my injury and the timetable in which I was allowed to come back to work. The HR department received my long term packet and questionnaire by way of fax, but for one reason or another the letter head did not arrive to them. It was all sent at the same time.

I called my doctor up again. They said it was odd and resent it twice. I informed my HR contact that it was sent a second time and to inform me when they received it. I waited 2 business days. I send another E-Mail to the HR department about if they received the letter and I heard the next day that they had not received it. I turned around and called my doctor to send a third fax. I then sent another E-Mail to HR stating it was on its way and to please contact me when they receive it. I waited 24 hours.

At that point she was out of the office and received an automated e-mail on June 18th stating: ""I am sorry, but I am out of the office for a few days. I will return Tues. June 25th.""

I waited for her to return thinking everything was ok. However, when she returned on the 25th of June she still had not received the fax containing the letter from my doctor. Rinse wash repeat I called my doctor again. At this point this was looking like a cruel joke, but the doctor sent it a 4th time. This time I ""Called"" the office of the HR case worker to speak to them directly.

When I called the representative answered the phone with the HR Case workers name and asked how she could help me. I began to explain the situation over the phone and asked if she received my fax from my doctor. The HR representative all of a sudden out or pure magic had a deep southern accent and that her name was Nancy and that the person I was calling was not in the office and she was just working her station while she was at lunch.

I gave her my phone number, and I waited for her to call me back. I did not get a reply. No phonecall, no e-mail.. nothing. So I waited 48 hours and tried again sending her another e-mail asking about the status of my file and if she had received the fax from my doctor. I received another e-mail from the HR representative that the letter was still not there.

At this point I tried to send it to my manager at the store I work in to try and get the letter to her since it has been sent 4 times already in the span of 2 weeks. We are now at the day of my doctors appointment on  June 28th, She let me know that she has received all of the paperwork for my insurance EXCEPT for the letter that was already sent 4 times from my doctor. She acknowledged that she knew I had an appointment this day and informed me that the papers I had filled out for my ""Return to Work Notice"" DID NOT count as anything and she still needed the letter from my doctor on their company letter head. That was already sent 5 times.

I said no problem, I will be there in person I can make sure that happens. I did, and when I was at my doctor i saw they complete the fax and verify it was sent. By now I have the feeling you know where this is going. I haven't heard anything in 24 hours so I E-Mailed them again. I was informed that they STILL did not have the letter from my doctor. I regret to inform you the tone of my e-mails began to change. They became sarcastic in nature. I informed her that it was extremely odd that they did not receive this fax. I told her my doctor has shown me the letter and I have seen it with my own two eyes. i know it existed and they even told me the process on how they wrote the letter, but I continued with the charade and had them send ANOTHER FAX.

Surely, they had to get it this time. The letter I got back from my HR representative stated: ""The LTD was submitted a week ago, but the Letter from my doctor."" That was now sent 6 times was never received. After I received this e-mail I called my doctor one last time. I kept her on the phone, and she was laughing at how many times this had to happen. She thought it was absurd just as I did. After she had sent the fax a 7th time if she could send me a photo on my phone. She said: ""She could not because it is a document that is not meant to be owned."" I said: ""Is there another way that I can have this document sent to my place of employment so I can guarantee it gets to my employer."" She was hesitant to send it, but seeing how many she had already faxed it she was concerned and wanted to help. She then sent the letter in an e-mail to me and I emailed it to my manager at work.

My next e-mail after all of that work was to say that I was terminated from employment because they received the letter too late. This is what the e-mail stated that I received from my HR Case Handler on Jul 1st 2019:

""I spoke with my HRVP and explained how some information for your leave has been received from your doctor, but no note has ever been received. At this point your employment will be terminated and when you are able to return to work you can work with your manager to be re-hired. If you have any questions please let me know.""

At this point my manager and Regional manager tried to find a way for me to keep my job and not be terminated. I received another E-Mail from the same case worked and it stated as follows:

""The note was received by fax today Jul 2nd 2019 and I had it revived by HR. Here is their determination. Your doctors note does not qualify her for an extension. Please let her know that she only qualifies for FLMA, and at this time she has exhausted her leave and therefore must be terminated. She may apply again when she is released to work without restrictions.""

I need help, thoughts &amp; opinions on this situation please. Thank you for reading all of this.

We did not have the luxury of looking at apartments before arriving due to time and financial constraints. We simply chose the best apartment based on reviews and applied online. It is worth noting that ever location we called told us that if we apply and are accepted the security deposit would be forfeit if we decide not to rent after being accepted (the deposit must be given at the time of applying). 

To make a long story short we signed the lease and sent it back after being *verbally* told that we had 48 hours to get it notarized and sent back to the office. We then drove over 20 hours only to find that the apartment conditions were as follows:

Upon moving in, the carpet and floors were wet because they had just been cleaned. This caused us to not be able to move our belongings into the apartment. They were still wet at 12:30am (time of this email draft).

The tub/shower faucet was found to be broken the day we moved in. Normally checks and apartment cleaning (see above) should be taken care of in advance to moving in. Notice of our move-in was known well in advance (June 24). The maintenance gentleman (very nice dude) did not clean up after he finished repairing the tub. This was completed after we moved in.

In the master bedroom there is a giant hole in the wall near the ceiling, where I believe a vent should be sitting. The vents that are in the apartment are covered in dust and so is the surrounding ceiling. 

An entire half of the apartment sits at least 10 degrees hotter than the rest. The AC is only effective in the living room. This may be due to the vent issue mentioned above.

While moving in, we noticed a couple gentleman smoking marijuana right by the door to our building (2520). 

We found debris on the wood floors that had to be vacuumed up before we were able to lay out our air mattress in the dining room. The circuit tripped no more than 30 seconds after I started vacuuming.

The bathroom sink does not drain properly. It takes over 30 seconds for the sink to drain fully.

On our apartment entrance door, there is a noticeable gap between the molding and the door. It appears as if either the molding is ripped off or the door is not sitting flush with the frame. This is not visible on other apartment doors.

While [office lady] was giving us the ""tour"" of the apartment, the sliding door handle in the second bedroom snapped off.

The stairwell in our building is quite smelly and appears as if it hasn't been cleaned in quite some time.

There is a space in our hallway closet that just opens up to the inside of the wall where the tub sits. This may be necessary for maintenance, but it gives critters and insects a place to get in (so does the hole in the master bedroom).

In that same closet, there appears to be remnants of shaving equipment on the shelves and strange body hair.

Across from that very same closet, we found 3 finger nails sitting on the rug against the baseboard.

On the rug right next to the kitchen area, we found a small screw just laying there in the carpet. 

The trim all throughout the apartment is banged up, and there are paint splatters on the floor of the dining room. This could reasonably be considered natural wear and tear.

[Office lady] did not have us fill out the electric form to have the service set up for us. She also did not give us the handbook or the lead pamphlet (both listed as required reading prior to signing the lease).

We plan on finding another location to rent and won't stay here any longer than we have to, but are we at all entitled to getting any of our money back? We have paid security and a prorated first months rent.

I received a speeding ticket last August in 2018 for doing 75 in a 50. I am almost certain I was not speeding or going over the limit.

This time around, they provided me the disclosure on the day of (just a copy of the officers notes). His notes clearly stated that there was no audio or video, since he was using a LIDAR on the side of the road, and on a motorcycle.  My argument to the JP was that I am in belief that he tagged the wrong vehicle and pulled me over. He asked me if I want a trial or an adjournment, and suggested that I seek a paralegal if this is what I believe. However, I don't want to pay $350-$400, for a case that clearly has no evidence, but a LIDAR reading. Do I have a case, given that there is no audio, video, or any witnesses? Can I fight this on my own? Just before the JP asked if I wanted a trial, the prosecutor came back and re-asked me if I wanted a plea deal, which I turned down, since again I am almost certain I was not going over the limit. It ended with the JP adjourning the trial to give me time to think, for another 3 months, which will be the 3rd visit...Mind you this is my first speeding ticket received and have never been to trial.

I've always understood MAP to be a ""take it or leave it"" policy. In other words, I've always understood MAP to be a policy where if you don't follow it, you can be terminated as a dealer. I didn't think dealers could be sued (successfully) for not following it.

Also, I understood MAP to only be in effect while the dealership was active. I didn't think they could hold you to MAP after being terminated (when it didn't specifically give guidance with regards to MAP after a dealership was terminated).

And actually, the product they cited was one that they ""unofficially"" told us was OK to advertise below MAP a few months earlier.

After termination, they gave us 56 days to sell thru existing inventory and refused to take anything back for a refund.

I am in Indiana, and this occurred in Florida.
I will try to summarize as much as possible on this whole issue. Last November, went on vacation to an amusement park with my family.  Our last day there, we had special event tickets and were looking forward to a great day. The resort provides bus transportation to their various parks and as I am disabled (psoriatic and osteoarthritis with broken vertebrae) I was using a scooter to traverse the parks. As per every other day, I was admitted to the bus first. Strapped in and advised to remain seated on the scooter. Other guests boarded and we headed out. Halfway through the trip, the bus driver took an extremely hard turn, throwing myself and the scooter over. 
Ultimately, the bus driver did nothing to assist me and when we finally arrived at the park he left us on the sidewalk without any assistance. Once we got to the onsite clinic, I was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. It was determined that at the very least I had a ruptured disc and should follow up with Dr. at home. Pain killers were administered and the rest of the vacation was a bit fuzzy. I honestly only remember the pain of driving 18hrs home. 
Our private insurance has been taking the brunt of this since November. I've been through 2 months of physical therapy and insurance refuses to pay for an MRI to find out why I am still in pain. The amusement park has now sent paperwork to my doctor requesting that they sign off that I am done with being treated before they will discuss anything further. I don't know what to do.  
I feel like either way I go I am screwed. At this point, I cannot afford to pay for an MRI out of pocket, so any treatment is at a standstill. Shouldn't the amusement park be responsible for some of the bills? I am still in pain specific to this injury and fear I may always be.
Any advice is appreciated on what we should do next.

Sometime during the beginning of the week, they were playing with my dog and pulled too hard on the toy resulting to severely hurt him. According to what they said: something flew out of his mouth (tooth, or peace of his gum) and then he started to bleed uncontrollably. 

They had my number and could have called, but chose not too. They also chose not to take him to the veterinary. They left him to bleed and to drown in a pool of infection. 

When I came back, they didn't tell me right away. One of them told me what happened hours after I came back...

I took my dog to the vet and got antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, but the vet said we can't continue to give him those because the swollen area hasn't gotten any better. She suggested a series of tests, i.e. radiology, along a multitude of other tests to determine the issue. The estimate for that is over 500$. 

Whenever I bring the situation up to them they assign the blame on me and tell me that I'm exaggerating, that it was an accident and to basically do nothing. They are refusing to take responsibility for their actions, or lack of.

I wanted to take them to court from the get go, but my whole family advised me against it because it would ruin our friendship. I didn't know of the consequences and I was put in a difficult situation. 

My question is: can I take them to civil court even though 6 months have passed and have them take responsibility for what happened and make them pay for the veterinary bills? 

Multiple people have told me that I can, others have said I would lose the case and that it's too late...

Next month, I am moving into a townhouse with friends I know. Currently on the lease is Lessor 1 and her brother Lessor 2. Also living with the Lessor 1 is her boyfriend. 

The lease runs until February. However, Lessor 2 wants to move out. I am going to take his place. Currently, Lessor 1 handles all the payments and everyone pays her. Lessor 1, her boyfriend, and I are friends and they all have great relations with the landlord. 

The landlord knows that I am moving in. She is fine with adding me to the lease or just removing Lessor 2. Lessor 1 is fine with adding me to the lease or me just paying her like her boyfriend. Basically, no one cares.

&lt;p&gt;The lease runs until February. However, Lessor 2 wants to move out. I am going to take his place. Currently, Lessor 1 handles all the payments and everyone pays her. Lessor 1, her boyfriend, and I are friends and they all have great relations with the landlord. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landlord knows that I am moving in. She is fine with adding me to the lease or just removing Lessor 2. Lessor 1 is fine with adding me to the lease or me just paying her like her boyfriend. Basically, no one cares.&lt;/p&gt;

Only with a DSAR he could obtain the information to fight his ban, witch he won. I would would like to try that also. But i am awful with writing a solid formal letter. Plus i have a couple of questions with i would like to get some advice on.

the following information i need to know is:

\- Payment history to of my account- General account information(IMPORTANT)- All notes of my playing account(with out this i cant make a case)- All notes of my Forum account(not so much important but handy to have)

So i found this site( [https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-of-access/](https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/your-right-of-access/) ) they have a template witch looks good to sent to the said company.  So i would like to start form here and personalise my letter to my liking. I want to make a bit more aggressive. That is they dont comply with xx amount of time a complaint wil be filed [ICO.ORG.UK](https://ICO.ORG.UK).

\-Does the brexit effect the site [ICO.ORG.UK](https://ICO.ORG.UK)? or should i use a other website? if so witch one is better to use?- Is saying i wil fill in a complaint to the ICO not to aggressive?  or is it not enough and should i say it can included a fine)?

On the ICO website is says that said company can ask for a fee. How much is the fee in generaal? And can i refuse to pay duo that the information should be free for me?

I know i am asking a lot. And i think i left some bits and pieces out. I wil try my best to answer any questions you guys might have. i am at my wits end and i think this is my only way to get my account unbanned.

I want out. I deserve better. My kids deserve better. I don't know where to begin in leaving.  I hate even being in the same room as him. He is always yelling, scolding, and berating me.

After discussing with Enercare, I was made aware that the previous tenants were advised the unit must be replaced in 2017. Additionally, the unit stopped working after I signed, after the house passed inspection, which was a condition of my purchase, and before closing. Enercare again advised to replace the unit, but the owners elected to use a ""band-aid fix"" (language of Enercare). I have a written statement from Enercare on the above. 

&amp;#x200B;

My lawyer issued a letter indicating we understood that the vendors refused to replace the hot water tank knowing that if replaced the monthly rental would increase significantly and affect the sale price of the property.

Our officer charged 80000mt which was eventually brought down to 200mt (I don’t know how he must have been new) and he was pretty nice even laughing when I showed him my passport from when I had long hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officer 2 apparently was very intimidating and gave threats like 16 days in jail (there were 2 kids in the car) aswell as the passport and license to be taken away. They ended up paying around 6000mt. I don’t know how that works, can a officer really just use these tactics to get money and I’m sure if it was a real fine i would have to see some sort of proof? I’m really confused is they are allowed to do this as I’m sure we are not the first tourist to be hustled like this.&lt;/p&gt;

Apologies, I wasn't sure which sub it could belong to but that's pretty much the question. Although not a full geek, there were shows and games I grew up playing and watching. I find myself doodling away and I usually keep it to myself but people seem to like it when they end up seeing it. 


Just wanted to know if I could get any trouble in terms of copyright or anything like that if I decide to sell those in some form? They won't be exactly like the characters. Perhaps a little altered, drawn and illustrated in my style.  However, it would be identifiable. I'd also be illustrating my own characters, etc. 


I've seen people do it but just want some serious input on it before I jump in and get stuck in shit storm. I've heard Disney is pretty tight in these matters? I'm aware I'd still have to research but anyone with any insight would be greatly appreciated. I've tried asking these artists about it but got no response. 


I guess you could sell fan art without getting in trouble? I've seen people sell related stuff but not exactly the same as the real thing. Like a Spiderman blob sticker instead of real Spiderman in human form, if it makes sense. 


I live in the UK, if it helps. England to clarify. 

Is there anything I should get in place to protect myself against the possibilities of getting sued? Lawyers can be pricey and I understand the importance of having one. Perhaps when it's in a better place if I start. Any other suggestions are welcome.

I am a small business owner.  I am the only person registered with the state and city for the business.  I actually have a business partner though, but they is not listed.

Because I am the only person on the business, our business bank account is under my name and they are 2ndary. 

Lately we have been having disputes and they have given their self a couple of raises. They aren't much but they add up, and I have not agreed to any of them, nor have I received any raises as well.  I don't know what to do.  I have spoken with my business friends and they said it would be a potentially costly legal battle, unless i take it to small claims.  I feel like i have no recourse, there is no employee or wage contracts with the person.

So I've officially received an updated survey of the property I **WAS** planning on buying and currently out of the option period. It is located in Cypress, Texas and both HCAD and the sellers agent have the property listed at 48k sqft. The new survey shows it to be **29,503** feet.

I based my decision to purchase the property largely on the fact it was advertised at over an acre and now it is 39% less than advertised which affects me in more ways than one.

As this is my first home I wanted to do my due diligence and currently have about $5k wrapped up in it between all the inspections/surveys/appraisals. Additionally I will be using a VA loan and it required additional inspections.

The layout of the property makes it difficult to gauge the size and while it looks like a acre, feels like an acre, on paper it is most definitely not.

My questions are this,

If it somehow appraises at the decreased lot size how do I go about renegotiating the price.

If the appraisal comes in low (which it most likely will) and they do not budge, can I get **ALL** of my invested monies back based on the misrepresentation of the property?

What are your thoughts on this situation? The seller/agent (investment team) have been very deceitful throughout the entire transaction by simply refusing to answer simple questions and not providing accurate information. AGAIN, despite some of the issues with the house I based my rationale that the value was in **THE LAND** and not so much the house itself.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve officially received an updated survey of the property I &lt;strong&gt;WAS&lt;/strong&gt; planning on buying and currently out of the option period.

I live in Portland Oregon and have been renting a room in a privately owned home for over three years.

We had a new roommate move in several months ago and in the past few weeks they have basically made the house uninhabitable. After being on probation for a small harassment offense, they began drinking again, and told my roommate that it was chill for them to have one beer. However, since that beer, they have barely left their room except to get more alcohol - not even to use the bathroom. They have been aggressive towards all of us, have caused a leak of who knows what from their room into the dining room, pissed on the living room couch, vomited all over the living room, and their room is so full of alcohol and bodily fluids that it's caused the house to smell rancid and disgusting. As a result, two of us haven't been staying there and the third person is only their because they have no choice to be elsewhere. The offending roommate has supposedly given notice but the situation got so bad we have called a mental health care service because when we saw her last, she looked like she was dying (not eating, not drinking water, just alcohol) and had lost 20 lbs or so.

The main question I have is what is our recourse for getting our rent for this month back because of this situation? The landlords are aware and have sort of helped (gave her a lease Violation form) but have not made moves to clean the house up so we can Live there. They've gone so far as to think we'll be able to find new roommates somehow in the condition the house is in.

Please advise if possible. It's all so frustrating and absurd.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;

They have been aggressive towards all of us, have caused a leak of who knows what from their room into the dining room, pissed on the living room couch, vomited all over the living room, and their room is so full of alcohol and bodily fluids that it&amp;#39;s caused the house to smell rancid and disgusting. As a result, two of us haven&amp;#39;t been staying there and the third person is only their because they have no choice to be elsewhere. The offending roommate has supposedly given notice but the situation got so bad we have called a mental health care service because when we saw her last, she looked like she was dying (not eating, not drinking water, just alcohol) and had lost 20 lbs or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main question I have is what is our recourse for getting our rent for this month back because of this situation? The landlords are aware and have sort of helped (gave her a lease Violation form) but have not made moves to clean the house up so we can Live there. They&amp;#39;ve gone so far as to think we&amp;#39;ll be able to find new roommates somehow in the condition the house is in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please advise if possible. It&amp;#39;s all so frustrating and absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello! I asked on r/askLEO, got some scolding but still feel like I don't know what to do. 

I am staying at my father's house in California for the summer (he is away out in the brush in AK, for weeks at a time, with no phone or connection to the outside world, yes he's totally that guy). 

With his permission, allowed an ex GF to stay for ""a visit"", she moved a bunch of bags in and now doesn't want to leave. 

She does not listen to reason. I politely asked her to get her things and leave and she does not want to, and because of that I suspect she is going to Instead try to claim residency at my father's house. As crazy as that sounds, it wouldn't actually be that crazy for her. She knows that you need 30 days to establish residency. She has currently been here for about 2 weeks.  (I'll check that). 

Yes, it is my fault for allowing her in in the first place, however now we are here. And I want to know what I can do to protect myself, from her claiming residency in My Father's House. 

I am a 6'7"" male so if I physically keep her out I will surely be arrested. And if the standard is that after they've lived there for 30 days, you need to go through the eviction process, then what is the process *before* 30 days? 

So, I feel helpless. Please, tell me what I'm supposed to do. I don't want this person in my house. Thank you very much.

We are on Long Island in New York State.  The financial agreement at this time was flexible, due to him living with me in my previous residence for three years and six months for *free*.  (His home was under reconstruction due to Hurricane Sandy damages.) After moving into his house, I paid the majority of the utility bills, he paid the entirety of the mortgage and occasional utilities (all of which are in his name).  In addition, I furnished 95% of the home, purchase 100% of all groceries and toiletries, and paid for bi-weekly cleaning services. In February, 2019, I paid him $500 toward his mortgage in cash. (I know...) I am a habitual receipt hoarder and (usually) meticulous record keeper. 

Beginning in approximately March 2019 to present day, we have been steadily heading towards terminating the relationship.  At times we are at odds, he makes consistent and frequent threats to evict me and/or remove my belongings from the home.  Occasionally, we will have a few good days and behave as if everything is fine.  Rinse, repeat.  Because of this, I began to pay the utilities less frequently (in order to financially prepare to relocate).  On June 20, 2019, our gas was shut off.  On 6/23, he verbally agreed to split the cost of the total amount due to restore service ($500).  On 6/24, I made a payment of $95 toward the gas. . No additional payments have been made. We are still without gas (hot water, access to the stove, etc.) I have been taking showers at family and friend’s houses. 

On 6/30, we got into yet another verbal altercation, causing him to threaten eviction (again) and threatened physical harm when I refused (this one really escalated). On 7/1, he moved his homeless brother who has a criminal record into the home (in an effort to intimidate me into moving?) He seems under the impression this homeless brother is going to be of more financial assistance to him. 
The house we live in is strange/unique/not practical whatsoever; the master bedroom is on the third floor of the home and does not contain a door of any kind (it simply has a staircase leading up to it, and BAM there’s our/my bed!) Yesterday, in order to make room for his brother’s four trash bags consisting of the entirety of his belongings, he decided to partially empty a closet with my belongings in it. He placed these items on the floor of my bedroom, (not damaging them). (I’m unsure of why he simply did not ask me to move these items myself.) I really do not wish to go “tit-for-tat” with this person, but preventing me from storing my belongings anywhere besides the floor and/or furniture I’ve purchased is childish. (I might as well lock up all the dishes and toilet paper while I’m at it!)

My questions are as follows: are my rights that of a licensee or a co-tenant? Can he legally move additional persons into the home, even though my bedroom has no door/partition (construction was prohibited on this floor at time of receipt of the certificate of occupancy)? Can I legally prohibit him from sleeping in my bed? (As I’ve mentioned, ALL furniture in the home was purchased by me with receipts readily available.)

Yesterday, in order to make room for his brother’s four trash bags consisting of the entirety of his belongings, he decided to partially empty a closet with my belongings in it. He placed these items on the floor of my bedroom, (not damaging them). (I’m unsure of why he simply did not ask me to move these items myself.) I really do not wish to go “tit-for-tat” with this person, but preventing me from storing my belongings anywhere besides the floor and/or furniture I’ve purchased is childish. (I might as well lock up all the dishes and toilet paper while I’m at it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My questions are as follows: are my rights that of a licensee or a co-tenant? Can he legally move additional persons into the home, even though my bedroom has no door/partition (construction was prohibited on this floor at time of receipt of the certificate of occupancy)? Can I legally prohibit him from sleeping in my bed? (As I’ve mentioned, ALL furniture in the home was purchased by me with receipts readily available.)&lt;/p&gt;

I am a Canadian. I moved to France on August 12, 2018 with a Holiday Working Visa. It's a deal that Canada has with France where youths (people under 35) can travel and work abroad to pay for their travels in select countries. During 2018, I was never in France consecutively for more than 6 months. I traveled to other parts of Europe, and being in Asia for about 3 weeks. I worked in 2018, taking various jobs such as babysitting and teaching English.

Fast forward to June 2019, I was coming back from 10 days in Toronto (visiting family, etc.). Before heading to Toronto, I purchased a few luxury items for my friends and family. I also purchased some jewelry at the Cartier store at the DUTY FREE SHOP at the airport. I received my TVA back (VAT taxes) because I thought I could. I didn't consider myself a resident. At this point, I have an APS (Autorisation Provisoire Sejour) - not even a regular visa. When I returned to Paris from Toronto, I was stopped by 3 douane (custom) officers. I didn't understand why they stopped me and went through my entire luggage. It was if they were looking for something - they asked whether I had a watch and I don't but they saw my bracelets and interrogated where I got it. Anyway, they kept me for over 3 hours, with 3 officers, and charged me. The officers charged me a total of 1700 euros for the following:

\- claiming TVA refund when I shouldn't because I am considered a resident - I was charged 20% TVA for all items purchased (even tho my refund was only 12%)

\- purchasing jewelry at the duty free shop and then coming back to France with it - apparently I am not allowed to bring the goods back to the country

Can someone confirm if I am a french resident? I rent in France and I work with a CDI under the APS visa. At first it was Holiday Working Visa which was renewed to APS. I never filed taxes in France for 2018 because my income was small. I filed my taxes as a Canadian resident. I was also never in France for more than 6 months consecutive for 2019 at the time. I asked a few lawyer friends and some stated that they don't think I am a resident. I am really hoping someone on this forum can give me some guidance. I am traumatized by the whole experience. I feel bullied. I don't know why it took 3 officers to detain me. ALSO, one of the officers made a really judgmental remark. I told him I could not afford to pay 1700 euros in fees. I explained to him my financial situation. He said to me with the following ""You have no money to pay when you own a gucci bag, a dior bag, etc."".... that's when I stood up for myself and said he was being a judgmental prick. I made the money in Toronto with my career, but now I moved to France with nothing to explore a different culture. He has no right to judge my circumstances.

So when I toured my Apartment, one of the first things I noticed was the sign had the entrance that warned the building was under 24 hour surveillance.

Fast forward to last night I had date I came home and was smoking a cigarette out back. Guy comes up to me starts making me nervous I try and go back inside.

After they left I texted my property manager and asked if the tapes got anything. She ignored my question.

I stayed at hotel last night because I was nervous. This morning I have looked around the entire common areas and exterior of the building. I can't find cameras anywhere either discreet or obvious. I think the signage is a complete bluff to deter criminals. I Just reread my lease and there's a section that says ""Neither Manager no landlord or any agent of Manager covenant nor warrants expressly or implicitly the security of person and/or property"" I took this to mean standard liability waiver and since another part of the lease required renter's insurance I figured my insurance would cover any claim for stolen property. But now I don't know what to think since I was lead to believe there were cameras.

So am I shit out of luck? I feel lied to and betrayed and I don't know what to do. I kinda of feeling nervous and unsafe.

I worked for the company for two years as a district manager. I am a top performer and received an above target rating on my last performance review. 

I was asked to meet with my supervisor on Tuesday this week. When we started the meeting he said ""this doesn't seem to be working for us so I find it best that we part ways."" I was surprised. I will add for relevancy that we had recently had several conversations in which we disagreed about our approach to a particular problem but I worked within all company policies and I was not disrespectful in any way. 

I was asked to return my company car and other belongings by the end of the next day. My email was shut down by noon. They will not pay me any of my vacation or personal time. They are also withholding a $3,500 bonus that I earned in 2018 which they decided to split payment for this year. 

I was not asked to sign anything and nothing was provided in writing for the termination. Nothing at all was put in writing. 

My initial inclination was to move on (I have been looking for a new opportunity for a while). However, I asked if I would be provided any discharge paperwork and I was told I would not. I was further upset because a few of my direct reports were led to believe I had done something severe to justify the termination. 

What recourse of action do I have? I have read that I can request a service letter that forces the employer to provide information about my termination? 

I am also shocked they didn't provide in writing when my last day of pay would be- absent any written documentation, couldn't I argue that I understood I would be paid all outstanding vacation/personal time? Can I make a small claims case against the employer for this missing payment? 

Thanks in advance for any advice, I am happy to answer any additional questions.

People will be coming in and out of my house a lot yet I had no say in it whatsoever.

EDIT: Its not that I want to stop them from coming in and helping. My concern is that he needs to be in a rehab facility, which is an option available to him, at least in the short term.

He has gotten progressively worse, now in the hospital. Unfortunately, I&amp;#39;m at my limit as to what I&amp;#39;m able to continue to provide. I work from home and this is putting too much of a strain financially, physically and emotionally. I&amp;#39;m one person. Pat can barely walk or shower now. He refuses to go to a rehab facility. I don&amp;#39;t think I can continue to provide help. He fell the other day and was on the floor for a half hour and I had no idea because I wasn&amp;#39;t around. I feel Pat needs inpatient help until he is stable enough. 
However, I found out that home healthcare arrangements are already made. Pat needs iv fluids, help showering and PT. People will be coming in and out of my house a lot yet I had no say in it whatsoever. When I found out, I told Pat that I can&amp;#39;t really handle that now, as I work from home and am struggling to make ends meet. I don&amp;#39;t think this is a good idea. 
Don&amp;#39;t they need my permission? I&amp;#39;m the homeowner. No one asked me. No one asked if I felt capable of taking this on. 
What happens if Pat hurts himself in my house? Am I liable?
I feel bad, but this person needs a lot of care. He should be at a rehab facility. Not my house.
EDIT: Location United States, Midwest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Its not that I want to stop them from coming in and helping. My concern is that he needs to be in a rehab facility, which is an option available to him, at least in the short term. Once he is stronger, I can continue to help. I&amp;#39;m dealing with a tremendous amount of guilt right now. I want to do the right thing. But honestly, it&amp;#39;s safer for him to be in the rehab clinic, where he can be helped 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;

My father sold our Eastside WA house in Spring 2017. He was traveling abroad and I was not living there. I recall him wanting to rent on Airbnb not the sale of the home. Summer 2018 I went back to the property. I walked to the home and noticed the lack of care the new inhabitants had for the property. No plants, flowers, dead grass, removal of trees. I triggered the alarm entering the home. I could not turn it off.

Police arrive and place me in the car. My old neighbor tries to explain I used to live there. Original charge felony burglary. I am placed in solitary for 60 days. They kept telling me I'm not competent for trial. So I am moved and restored at Western State. I arrive back at jail and am notified I won't have to attend trial if i opt for Mental Health Court. Sure I sign it. I'm am released. Paper says I'm schizophrenic. I didn't argue because I wanted out of jail. Total stay six months.

My problems are as follows:
1) I am visually impaired. I have genetic retnia damage. I have severe eye and neck pain. I want to use marijuana. How can I do this? I had a medical card but WA got rid of the medical program.
2) I now have to live in a low income apartment because I don't have family in the area. I was planning to move abroad.

In summary the new owners seemed to get their way. I feel abused. In court the judge wouldn't even give the lawyer time to speak. There kept being conflicting information like telling me they would drop the case.

He has no violent or sexual charges or history, but has a few smaller drug charges from when he was younger.

Complicating matters is the fact that they rent an apartment and he is not listed on the lease (at the time she didn’t want to risk not getting the apartment due to his record as it is a “nicer” snooty area and they needed to move somewhere immediately. As a result he’s technically not allowed to be living there but it’s been over a year and no issues) so he doesn’t know what to say if they ask where he lives or where he would be living upon release. He doesn’t want to give their address, go through a verification (if there even is a process for this - they’re not sure if the police would check or not), and then have her get evicted and be homeless too.


They do not have money for a lawyer and she has reached out multiple times over the past 8 months to several low cost or pro bono ones in the area and no one has contacted her back. They’re both frustrated and I can see it’s hurting them a lot.


I’m trying to gather as much information as I possibly can in order to give to them so things can be sat down, planned, and they can move on. She’s put so much of her life on hold for him because of this issue and I know he just wants her to be able to have everything they’ve talked about but it can’t happen until he gets his shit together.

I was told I had a trust fund, I was not given any other information other than when I turned 18 I would receive my trust fund. When the time came around for me to receive it, I was told there was no money left. Years later after doing some digging I came across an itemized deduction list of my trust fund. All the expenses, the clothes I needed, the school supplies, everything came out of my trust fund. Even my graduation ring I had wanted so bad. I remember discussing it with my social worker, she told me to pick out which ever one I wanted no matter the price, they would pay for it is what I was told. So of course I picked out the most expensive one. Never was I told where the money came from. As far as foster care goes I thought the government was required to pay for this themselves? Government funding and things like that is what I thought paid for foster care not a child&amp;#39;s trust fund?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is this:is it illegal for them to use a child&amp;#39;s trust fund without them even knowing for foster care expenses? Is it possible for me to get my trust fund back?&lt;/p&gt;

This is my case and its quite tricky. i got cited going  “about 90 mph” in a 65 mph  zone on the freeway. 
(22349a vc) i think that’s actual bull. 

Notes: Traveling SD to LA about 141 mi
traffic wasn’t as heavy despite being fourth of July. Google Maps approximated a 2hr 18min arrival time . I make this trip weekly.  
Avg rate of speed to make it within this time which i did has to be ~70mph 
I had no motive for speeding. I don’t celebrate 4th of July nor do i have family where i was going. I live by the “my destination isn’t going anywhere” quote 

Start: I was traveling with/at the speed of traffic which is stated to be legal within the CA drivers handbook.  The speed of traffic at the time  around 80~mph there were others around me traveling at my speed. Last i checked in this area i was barely hitting 80 mph! Again still traveling at the speed of traffic

Now approx 4 mi AFTER the zone of citation the I-5’s lanes go from 5 lanes to 3 lanes .(I-5 N Buena Park/ Santa Fe Swapmeet area) . 

Theres always a normal slowdown all throughout this 4 mi stretch as the freeway converges to 3 lanes. This time there was hardly a slowdown at all ! the flow of traffic was still consistent. 
I was flashed down id say about 2 miles into the 4 before the slowdown, but couldn’t pull over since there was no shoulders and had to do a drive of shame as i approached the closest exit after the start of the 3 lanes. 

I know i wasn’t going no 90 mph i was in total confusion when i was flashed down as again i was traveling at the speed of traffic. 

I’ve never gotten a single traffic ticket. 
I don’t wish to think about how much this will cost..

I need advice on:

what to do next? 
what are my options on fighting this?  should i even? 
How to avoid a point on my record? 
How to reduce ticket cost? ( i’m poor )

**tl:dr:** My ObGyn's inaction occurred ~10 years ago. It doesn't impact me now, but I am still upset.  I don't remember her name. How do I find her name? Can I still report the doctor?  How or to whom?  Washington, DC


**Background:**  Sometime in 2005-2007, I had sex in which my Boyfriend's condom broke.  It was Friday or Saturday night.  I called my ObGyn's emergency line to ask the On-Call ObGyn to send a prescription for Plan B to the Pharmacy.  I called the Emergency line a few times, and the representative said they contacted the On-Call ObGyn.  But the On-Call ObGyn never called me, and I never got Plan B. [The On Call ObGyn was *not* my original ObGyn.] 


I panicked because Plan B needs to be taken within the first 72 hours to be effective.  I became pregnant.  My original ObGyn referred me to a different doctor who did a DNC. The surgery was quick and painless.   I never told my original ObGyn because I was so focused on the pregnancy/DNC.  


However, over 10 years later, I am still angry at that On- Call ObGyn.  She's the reason that I even needed the DNC.  I don't remember her name, but I vaguely remember what she looked like.  I have changed insurance firms, I don't remember my original ObyGyn.  


**How do I even find her name?  Can I report her? Where do to report her?  I want her to be punished.  I do not have evidence that I called the Emergency line and she never helped me.**


**EDIT:**  During the pregnancy or soon after, I ran into the On-Call ObGyn.  I informed her who I was, and she looked away when she remembered (that she didn't reply to my emergency call).  Hence I feel it was intentional and not a mistake.


PS. I'm doing ok in my life right now.  


PPS. It sounds like it's too late for anything to happen - EVEN if something could be done.  Please post a comment if you feel otherwise.  Thank you for letting me know.

Thank you.
