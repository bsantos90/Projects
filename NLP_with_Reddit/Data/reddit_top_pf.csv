However I asked her a few questions about what to look for in pictures, or finding these obvious things out first so I do not waste anybody’s time.

This is a feasible plan but the thought of going back to that school scares me. I would not go back if I had to stay for much longer. Also linguistics isn't the most marketable major and you don't even need a linguistics major to teach abroad.

My other choices are to go to one of my state colleges.

The other in state option is a smaller school that doesn't have as much opportunities for my intended major but is within driving distance from my parents' house and I would not have to pay for housing. Transferring also gives me to try out other fields that interest me like CS and Architecture.

I am very scared and anxious about this decision. It keeps me up all night and I know that making a decision and sticking to it will be best but I am the worst at making decisions.

My dad works in a mechanic shop but all the money he makes go right back into rent and maintenance very rarely he brings $300-$1000 home. He can't sit around and not work so he just goes there. He was recently injured and has ongoing dental problems. Dental alone is costing thousands for a fix and his therapy on top of that. He has multiple bank accounts. SO many that he can't remember which one's he has open and he keeps on taking out loans for his shop. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom recently had an injury but she recovered and is working 12 hour shifts constantly just to keep us afloat. She's studying on top of that. Each course is costing her about $1000 or more. She finished 3 years and she has 1-2 years left. 

&amp;#x200B;

I made this post because we just got a call from a debt collecting company saying we owe $2,640 to another bank and at this point we just need help.  I can give more information if needed","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throwaway because yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

I went on credit karma and looked at my credit report and saw that as of right now there are 4 accounts open in my name:

I'm really worried about the Amazon and JPMCB cards.

I didn't even know what JPMCB stood for until I googled it, and I have no idea what she's been using that for. 

I also know that the electricity bill is under my name, but I'm not sure how that affects me.

Not sure if this is the right forum, but I have a feeling this miiight be some sort of a scam, but not sure.

Ok, background - my mother-in-law is a single, just turned 60 year old lady in a Baltic country (Eastern Europe). She has two grown-up children (including my wife) and a medium-sized house and shared garden with her son. Income is ok for sustaining herself, maybe little savings, but nothing significant.
She has been single for the past 10 years or so.

Now, the story develops over the past two weeks (we found out about it a week ago). Apparently there is this US Army officer/doctor (don’t have the exact details on all of this but please bear with me), who is on his last mission before going into retirement, he is 62.
So somehow he has found my MIL online (Facebook) and they are exchanging long messages and chats all day. His background is that he had a wife and kid from our country, who passed away in a car crash some years ago, so he is seeking for someone to ‘age beautifully’ with, but from the same country.

Apparently the messages are very passionate, he is already speaking of moving to our country after his mission ends and moving in together with her.
The latest info is that he’s asking her to go to Asia with him (they haven’t met yet). However, we stressed that they need to meet here first.
They are conversing in English and she is extremely happy that she has found someone. But all this seems very odd to me. 

Another weird point is that even though they started speaking on Facebook, he said that due to army rules he can’t use it a lot and asked to move the convo to ‘hangout’, which I think is a dating app.

All this seems very strange and a ‘dream come true’ for a 60 year old. However, I can’t really come up with a scam strategy...

 I’m getting paid for vacation I didn’t use at my job (so, all of my available vacation days since I didn’t take any this last year...or the year before that). My check will be about $3,000.

So, my plan was to take a 10-day vacation before school starts. I already booked my flights through frequent flyer miles, but when it came time to book my hotel and rental car, the costs got overwhelming. I haven’t taken a vacation in 7 years so I was a little bit out of touch with how much hotels cost (I feel like $100/night is pretty expensive, no?). 

I cancelled my trip, and honestly I’m devastated. I was so excited. I was really looking forward to unplugging in the mountains of Washington State. 

But I figured that my money was best spent on my loans for grad school, which all-in-all will be about $25,000.  

But what’s the right balance? Did I do the right thing? Or am I always going to regret not spending some time and money on myself just so that I can have fewer loan payments after grad school is over?

Basic details:

* I'm 25 years old and **just** finished my Master's in Athletic Training
* My **monthly income** after taxes is **$3200**, this is my **first month** on my **new job @ a Public University**
* Currently the I have an **extra $1000** coming in from a different teaching position
* I plan to **pay $1200 monthly** **towards** my **loans**
* I have an excellent **credit score \~760**
* My **mom** **cosigned** the **loans**
* My **income** will **not change** for the next **2 years**

All my **private loans** are through **Discover for $63,340**. Details about my private loans:

* One **account balance is $52,640** and has these consolidated loans that have **payment deferred until May 2020**:
   * **$22,000** @ interest rate of **5.490% fixed** , deferred interest balance of $560
   * **$14,000** @ interest rate of **5.240% variable**, deferred interest balance of $197
   * **$16,640** @ interest rate of **5.115% variable**, deferred interest balance of $385
* Second account amount balance is **$10,700** @ interest rate of **4.740%** **variable**, minimum payment due of $25, deferred interest balance of $63, principal $292, interest $757

**Federal loan** is **$20,000** @ interest rate of **3.4%**, it's been deferred till July 2020.

**Questions:**

* Is variable interest rate bad currently/in my situation?
* Should I look into refinancing my private loans now though my major private loan is deferred currently?
* From this sub it seems like I should keep the federal loan and think of income based repayment (IBR) is that accurate?
* How should I go about paying these off? I've heard about the strategy where you pay off the highest interest loan first after minimum payment on all, but most of my loans are deferred, am I better of starting to pay them now?
* Since my annual income is &gt;70k, I've read that student loan interest can be deducted up to $2,500, is this helpful to me in anyway?

Any/all advice would be appreciated. Thank you for helping a newbie out in advance!

&lt;li&gt;I plan to &lt;strong&gt;pay $1200 monthly&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;towards&lt;/strong&gt; my &lt;strong&gt;loans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have an excellent &lt;strong&gt;credit score ~760&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;mom&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;cosigned&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;loans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My &lt;strong&gt;income&lt;/strong&gt; will &lt;strong&gt;not change&lt;/strong&gt; for the next &lt;strong&gt;2 years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my &lt;strong&gt;private loans&lt;/strong&gt; are through &lt;strong&gt;Discover for $63,340&lt;/strong&gt;. Details about my private loans:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One &lt;strong&gt;account balance is $52,640&lt;/strong&gt; and has these consolidated loans that have &lt;strong&gt;payment deferred until May 2020&lt;/strong&gt;:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$22,000&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;5.490% fixed&lt;/strong&gt; , deferred interest balance of $560&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$14,000&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;5.240% variable&lt;/strong&gt;, deferred interest balance of $197&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$16,640&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;5.115% variable&lt;/strong&gt;, deferred interest balance of $385&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second account amount balance is &lt;strong&gt;$10,700&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;4.740%&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;variable&lt;/strong&gt;, minimum payment due of $25, deferred interest balance of $63, principal $292, interest $757&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Federal loan&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;$20,000&lt;/strong&gt; @ interest rate of &lt;strong&gt;3.4%&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;#39;s been deferred till July 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is variable interest rate bad currently/in my situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I look into refinancing my private loans now though my major private loan is deferred currently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From this sub it seems like I should keep the federal loan and think of income based repayment (IBR) is that accurate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should I go about paying these off? I&amp;#39;ve heard about the strategy where you pay off the highest interest loan first after minimum payment on all, but most of my loans are deferred, am I better of starting to pay them now?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since my annual income is &amp;gt;70k, I&amp;#39;ve read that student loan interest can be deducted up to $2,500, is this helpful to me in anyway?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any/all advice would be appreciated. Thank you for helping a newbie out in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

But I just need some advice on how to proceed. 

So I’ve been living in my apartment in Texas for about 7 months.  It’s a great community and I love it. But it’s expensive. I was able to afford it at the beginning of my lease, but some things have come up that have left me scrambling to pay my rent the past couple of months. Last month, I was five days late on rent, so there’s the late fees for that, which I haven’t paid because I’m unable to, and now I’m late on this month’s rent which I don’t even have enough for the base amount due, let alone the fees. Nobody has contacted me about eviction in any way whatsoever, but I’m just waiting for it to come any day now. I don’t know the laws or process when it comes to how eviction works, I’ve never had to deal with it because I’ve always been pretty good about paying everything on time. But this year has been different. I’ve had to sell some of my stuff to make rent and I did not like that. But that’s beside the point. I know that I have the option to terminate my lease at any time without any repercussions. It won’t go on my credit report and won’t affect me in the future when I try to rent/buy. But I will have to give a 60 day notice and also pay ~$2200 within 3 days of moving out. The thing is, I don’t know if I’d be able to pay that amount within that time frame. Maybe most of it, but definitely not all of it. 

I don’t know what to do about this, any advice would be appreciated. 

Tl;dr - scared about getting evicted; should I let it happen, or beat them to the punch and terminate my lease at the risk of not being able to pay the fees in full within 30 days?

Thank you to everyone who has responded to my post about this. I appreciate all of the feedback. I feel better knowing my next step and will go ahead and terminate my lease early so I avoid getting evicted.

- food 540$
- public transport (I don’t have a car) 180$
- phone 51$
- credit card (signatures I don’t want to cancel) 300$
- house bills 230$

My salary it is more than ok for me right now, last month I was able to save almost 1,5 and it made me feel pretty good. 

I want to do a MBA in my field so in the future I can be better at my job and of course, ask for a raise or get a new job at somewhere else. 

MBA 930$

It is for about 2 years and of course many things can happen in that time. Like, getting fired. Unpredictable things can happen. Our washing machine is having problems, pretty sure it will die soon.


Ask for a loan it is not a option.

The payoff on his mortgage was about $42k.  As part of the sale, I brought no cash to the table thanks to a gift of equity for my down payment plus seller assistance on closing costs. 

Basically, we set a sale price of $88k - $70k financed on my end, and the rest went to down payment.  I financed extra because of closing costs, and I wanted some extra money to do some necessary work, like new furnace, AC, and taking care of a rain water pooling at foundation problem. So when my stepdad got the check from the sale, he cashed it and then wrote one to me for the same amount, minus money for a furnace.

Could that portion be considered a gift?  

If so, follow up: The gift of equity is over the annual amount, but the check was below. Could the combined amount be considered a gift from my mom and stepdad below the $30k limit to avoid the form on their end?

My goal is to aggressively attack my credit card debt while saving some money and enjoying a modest social life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a spreadsheet of my financial situation:  [https://imgur.com/a/adUB9NO](https://imgur.com/a/adUB9NO)

I am very concerned about my $500 monthly food and fun allotment and being able to stick to that but will try my hardest.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have to purchase a vehicle next week.  I have budgeted up to $300 per month for an auto loan and am willing to put up to $2000 down on the vehicle.  I am giving myself a firm $20,000 out the door price limit and ideally want that number closer to $15,000. I expect my APR to be between 4%-6% with my credit score of 708.

Assuming that I do put down the $2,000, then I have $4700 cash in my bank account.  I am considering putting all of that towards my Discover Card.

&amp;#x200B;

**Credit Debt Plan:** 

My debt plan is to avalanche my debt, starting with my Discover Card. After the car purchase I plan to transfer my Discover card balance to a 0% introductory rate card.  Given my experience with this in the past I don't believe I will be approved to transfer the full balance.  So whatever is left over I plan to pay off immediately.  Then do the same on the Capital One card in October, and again with the Citi Card in February 2020.  As long as those cards are at 0% I am comfortable paying the minimum monthly and putting money towards my next highest interest rate, which in this case would be the 6.5% from one of my student loans.  

*Is this a good plan?*

**Savings Plan:**

I have an HSA with my new employer where they contribute $3000 at the beginning of every calendar year without me having to contribute anything. I don't plan to contribute anything additional for the first year or two, even though I know there are tax incentives. I think that money is better off being spent on attacking my credit debt first.  I am in good health and don't have any recurring medical expenses.  

*Thoughts?*

I will be eligible to start on the 401K plan at the beginning of 2021.  The company contributes 10% of your base salary every year, without requiring you to contribute anything.  However I would like to be in a position by that time to contribute.  

I plan to squirrel away 10% of each paycheck into an account for emergencies and vacations and those types of things.  

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, she is a struggling alcoholic who relies on Medicaid to help cover the cost of her psychological and physical ailments, and she can't get a full time job that pays more than $1200/mo without losing her health insurance (and she rarely makes $1200/mo). She's going to apply to food stamps, but even with food stamps, she probably won't be able to afford rent with so little money.

Back in May, I decided to switch from ATT postpaid plan to a prepaid one. Somewhere along the lines, something got messed up. Apparently, they had been continuing to charge me for data even though the original postpaid account should have been closed. Now I have a bill of $1200 that I have no idea how to pay. I have tried contacting them since I first got notification about the bill, but I have just been getting the run around ever since then. I got a letter in the mail that I'm on my final notice and that the account would be sent to collections fairly soon. They keep telling me that the charges are valid and that there is basically no way of reversing them, so I guess I'm going to have to figure out some way of paying it even though I never got any notice or bill that I was still being charged after I switched my account to prepaid.

I've been working on increasing my credit score as of late and have been doing fairly well, getting it to almost 700. And I've heard that collections can seriously ruin that and any decent chances at a good score. I'm 23 and will be graduating college in two more years, so I don't want something major that would affect my chances in the future. I stumbled upon LendingClub while browsing CreditKarma and was wondering if a personal loan is a good route to take instead of maxing out the pair of credit cards that I do have.

I'm 23, I bring in about $1000 a month. I have car payments at $230 (about $7000 remaining on the loan) and a phone bill at $60. I suppose I could also use the loan to pay off my remaining credit card debt &lt;$1500 too, but I'm not really sure what is a good route to take. I bank with Wells Fargo and Navy Fed (prior military) if either of those provides better loan options.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

I have never made a budget before. I came close a few times, but I have some mental blocks regarding it. I have a rough idea of what I spend. I make ~$3600 a month(70k/yr), paid every other week. I spend $740/mo on rent and between $40-80/mo on my phone plan.

I have nearly $17,000, broken up across different accounts (skip to after the dot if you don't care how it's broken up)

$4500 in an investments account, half of that actually invested. The rest I pulled from BYND when it was double what I invested. 

$3000 in a savings account I'd like to keep for emergencies.

$5000 in a checking account doing nothing, but I'll be paying my rent by check so I'll always need $2500 at the start of each month, before my roommates reimburse me. (I'm working on this, I'll try to get paid before the rent is due).

I've got another $4000 in checks I'll finally be cashing this weekend, and ~$5000? in bonds from gifts when I was born.

I'm looking at a new car for about $14,000, I might go up to $20,000 and pay it off in installments. My mom says that would help my credit. She also wants to co-sign if it helps lower the interest rate since that will help my credit. Is co-signing something I should be wary of for my credit? I'll definitely pay off whatever I spend on time. 

I also want to go abroad for my masters degree, in 2-3 years time or so. And that makes me hesitant to buy a car, especially if I want to stay out there for 3+ years.

I'm looking for some objective advice on a possible investment opportunity. 

A small holiday house on a rental plot at a holiday park became available, I heard through a friend that also has a house there. It is not in the best location in regards to being connected, but it is a great place to retreat to and the park itself has some really nice up to date facilities.

Now it is a nice small and secluded house that does need a bit of maintenance, especially the kitchen, but is overall in a pretty good shape and comes fully furnished. The buying costs are 5000 everything included, even plot rent until the end of the year. After December plot rent will be 250 a month. 

Now holiday houses at the park usually go for double that amount, so I could potentially buy it and sell it somewhere in the coming year. This attractive to me because, a. profit potential, and b. I have to leave my current apartment next summer and with this holiday house I could potentially leave early and half my monthly rent for a while, which would be nice as my current contract at work expires next January and there is no chance of an extension of the contract. It can also serve as a place to retreat while I do the writing necessary for my job.

My issues are these: 

* I have never spent this much money on anything before and as such am horribly inexperienced and am worried I am not seeing the whole picture.
* I could pay this whole, but it would take a big chunk out of my savings (about 2/3s).
* I would pay approximately 100 a month in fees for extras (internet, gas, electricity, water) on top of my normal expenses, which is doable, but will cut into my savings potential.

A bit of background about myself:

I have just finished my first year of university and am swiftly moving onto the next (studying in the UK). I have a summer job paying £8.21 an hour and a term time job paying a similar wage. Between this and my 4500 pound annual  maintenance loan I can take care of myself for the year. This does mean between my school fees and maintenance loan fees I am accumulating a debt of just of over 13k a year with an interest rate of about 6%. I also have access to a £1000 overdraft which has no interest for a year, not something I particularly need to use at the moment. 

I have no other significant financial barriers in my life at the moment. 

My plan 

I was originally going to put it into a savings account and an ISA but they all have crap interest rates. My current idea is to set aside a grand for any expenses that might suddenly crop up. Just leave this in a savings account taking the crap interest rate but its money that I can access at a moments notice. I was also going to put about 13 grand into a HSBC investment account, choose 6 funds and put just over 2 grand in each and watch it grow. As for the remaining grand I was going to create a standing order to put 250 pound into what HSBC call their regular saver. I can put up to 250 a month into it and im not allowed to touch it. At the end of the year they will give me 3% on what ever is in the regular saver. This obviously only gives me 4 months of run way but between birthdays christmas's,overtime,holiday pay and any money I can take out of my investment account I can cover the other 2 grand. I was also thinking the interest from this could offset any losses which might result from a bad performance of  a fund.

&amp;#x200B;

As to why im not paying off my debt. The student debt Only needs to be paid back once I make more than 27k a year. Also its more like a tax as any thing I make over 27k will be ""taxed"" at 9% (I think its 9). Not only this but the money I believe can be better spent. It can be used to cover rent for the year or used to put a deposit down on a house or buy me a car so I can commute to work. All of this gives me ""better earnings potential"" than simply paying the debt

&amp;#x200B;

Does this sound like a reasonable plan and do you have any other suggestions.

This obviously only gives me 4 months of run way but between birthdays christmas&amp;#39;s,overtime,holiday pay and any money I can take out of my investment account I can cover the other 2 grand. I was also thinking the interest from this could offset any losses which might result from a bad performance of  a fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to why im not paying off my debt. The student debt Only needs to be paid back once I make more than 27k a year. Also its more like a tax as any thing I make over 27k will be &amp;quot;taxed&amp;quot; at 9% (I think its 9). Not only this but the money I believe can be better spent. It can be used to cover rent for the year or used to put a deposit down on a house or buy me a car so I can commute to work. All of this gives me &amp;quot;better earnings potential&amp;quot; than simply paying the debt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this sound like a reasonable plan and do you have any other suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you &lt;/p&gt;

My tax situation for TY2019 is expected to be one W2 and one 1099, both myself.  We are MFJ with 2 kids, lIving and working in MA (though the 1099 is from RI).

I found out recently that my employer matches dollar-for-dollar the first $2500 we put into dependant-care FSA.  Being as my wife is a SAHM, I never much payed attention to it...however we recently had our second and I have until EOB Friday to change my benefits and elect DC-FSA since we recently had our second child.

We are considering putting our first in preschool this fall.  Since she doesn't work, I know I'll have to pay taxes at the end of the year for money used out of DC-FSA...but with the matching funds, would it make sense anyway for me to start contributing?  The preschool is only about $200/mo, but every little bit helps, ya know?  This way I would pay $100 and get an extra $100 match.  I suppose I'd be paying taxes on $200/mo at tax time, but it seems that $100 of that would almost be a raise, of sorts.

Thoughts?

She is worried that the bank will &amp;quot;catch on&amp;quot; that she cannot herself qualify for the mortgage and wants me to co-sign a new mortgage for the $80,000 remaining. I think my deceased father&amp;#39;s name is still on her mortgage (which I understand is another issue, but is frankly hers to deal with). I do not feel comfortable co-signing the mortgage with her. I will continue helping her out as long as I am able to do so (especially since I feel somewhat guilty that my father&amp;#39;s assets went to me, although I know he would have wanted it that way).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I wrong for not wanting to co-sign? For additional context, I am only 27 and am working full time while also in graduate school. I am going to have a lot of my own expenses now and in the future. I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do. Thank you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

No dependents and plan on staying that way. Old throwaway because my primary account is probably identifiable by some friends or family that might see this.


I've lurked here and r/financialindependence plenty, but generally feel out of my depth and uninterested in the ""active management"" approach. The lazier the better, as in everything.


Having changed careers (less than $30k/yr) into something that pays quite a bit more (now at $80k/yr) a couple of years ago and not feeling like I have as much to show for it financially as I should, I've been pondering paying a financial advisor for some help. I'm worried that if I pay someone $1500 right now, I'm just going to end up with a budget that I could have created on my own and $1500 less towards savings or investments.


I have 2 distinct short-er term goals:

* within 2 years, buy and outfit a van for living/adventuring. I realize that my living situation could change due to SO situation or whatnot in the meantime, but I like to go camping and hiking and adventuring a lot and this would enable that further, making me happier (the most important part!). And if that situation doesn't ariae, I have a much cheaper housing situation that would prepare me for the next part. I want to do this right, and expect the whole thing to cost in the neighborhood of $60k all said and done.

* partial retirement by 40. Looking to only need to pick up contracting or consulting work a couple days a week, and would expect an absolute minimum of $50/hr. I want to bump around the country going to national parks and exploring, then come back to WiFi or whatever and make enough to subsist that lifestyle on while whatever investments I have continue to grow. Timeframe would be somewhat flexible but I'm not working full time past 45 without being drug kicking and screaming.


Long term goal of continuing that lifestyle, willing to keep piddling with contracting or whatnot for a while, hard to particularly say now since that's so far in the future.


I have some assets and debt, but nothing spectacular.


Assets

* A little over $10k in high yield savings (ally), a couple thousand in my bank's lower yield (summer is expensive, I've been reluctant to move it all over and have to wait if I decide to do something. In winter my spending goes way down and it will all go to ally)

* a 401k that I'm not great at tracking the value of but is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $3k (I didn't enroll myself for too long, dumb move)

* $500 in wealthfront. Just getting started here.

* HSA with a couple thousand in it. 


Debt

* $5k left on a car loan, paying $270/mo right now

* $1300 in student loans. Making $350/mo payments so that's gone in a couple months, then divert most or all of that to the car

* Both of these are paying almost entirely principal, I'm accruing less than 2% interest total even if I don't shift the payments


My monthly bills (rent, insurance, phone, streaming services, etc) come out to about $1900/mo, and my take home is right at $5000/mo. I put $700/Mo in savings automatically, and try to put another ~$500 in each month.


I don't really feel like I need a financial advisor, since most of the cases I see if that are people that are in some horrible debt or tax situation and Im (thankfully, for the first time in my life) not. But I think the peace of mind of having it all figured out for me might be worth it. That said if it's just going to be a budget and pump more money into savings accounts and investments I don't want to waste my money. Though, also due to my huge pay increase I feel like I've let some lifestyle creep get me and now I'm not sure what kind of budget is reasonable, especially because I don't really ""have"" to. I can just go out and eat if I want, I have plenty of money. That's proving to be problematic for an aggressive savings plan.


Any recommendations, based on my story? Assuming they're well regarded and certified and not crazy expensive for my area, is a financial advisor...advisable?

We are currently registered as domestic partners, and I'm questioning whether marriage would be financially beneficial for us.

Basically I'm trying to create and Excel sheet that compares what our total take home pay will be in three scenarios: unmarried, married filing separate, or married filing jointly. Every time I search for an answer regarding one factor, I learn about something else I hadn't considered or didn't know about.

So, the factors I need to account for that I have identified are:

* If we are unmarried he can claim head of household
* If we are married filing joint taxes, my student loan payment will skyrocket
* If we are married filing separate my student loan payment will not change, but I won't be able to claim the interest deduction on my taxes
* If he claims head of household, he will be claiming the baby on his taxes. Does this mean he can also claim the child tax credit? How does this work? 
* If I claim the baby, my ""discretionary income"" will go down, so my student loan payment will go down (I think this is negligible compared to the benefits of him claiming head of household). 

&amp;#x200B;

What factors am I missing that will affect our take home pay? So far, it looks to me like the best option is to not get married, and have him claim the baby. However, I don't want to start crunching the numbers again until I know for sure I'm accounting for all the factors and haven't overlooked something. So far I have also not found a single beneficial thing that marriage will accomplish that can't also be accomplished another way without marriage. I know, I sound really romantic right now... Are there any other reasons that marriage might be a better option for us?

Background Info: 

Before taxes and deductions, he makes $80,000 annually, I make $61,000. I intend to stay full time at my job and just take my parental leave before returning to work. I don't expect either of us to have a loss in income. I have a large student loan debt, and am currently on the income based repayment plan (I pay 10% of my discretionary income towards loans annually). I qualify for public service loan forgiveness. We both have decent health insurance, but with our company's HSA contributions it is cheaper (even if we hit the maximum out of pocket) to each use our own insurance, not have both of us on one person's insurance. That means as long as we keep the same jobs, Imputed Income is not an issue if we don't get married (we've gone through this before with him on my insurance). It will be cheaper if the baby goes on my insurance. I also have a major medical condition that causes me to usually hit my maximum out of pocket, so I always make sure I contribute enough to have that amount in my HSA account. Having a dependent (baby) on my insurance would mean my company would double their HSA contribution, meaning I wouldn't have to contribute any more to my HSA than I already am to still have enough to cover the higher maximum out of pocket with a dependent. 

He owns the townhouse we live in. The plan would be to put me on the deed prior to baby being born. I don't know if this is a factor or not, but my understanding is that if he claims head of household he must pay majority of the household bills. 

Final question: If the baby is born in October, does that mean he can't claim head of household that year because he hasn't had a child for at least 6 months?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend and I have started talking about trying to get pregnant at the start of 2020.

&lt;p&gt;He owns the townhouse we live in. The plan would be to put me on the deed prior to baby being born. I don&amp;#39;t know if this is a factor or not, but my understanding is that if he claims head of household he must pay majority of the household bills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final question: If the baby is born in October, does that mean he can&amp;#39;t claim head of household that year because he hasn&amp;#39;t had a child for at least 6 months?&lt;/p&gt;

A lein will be put on our house and it will be financed through the water utility by default at 2% until we start making payments, then it increases to 4%.

We will also need to connect within 12 months of completion of the project. Costs are $8k to decommission our septic tank and run a pipe 150 feet from the house to the road. We will also need to pay a $5,800 hookup permit to the sewer department.

My husband and H both are using GI bills that we've budgeted to pay for our housing year round.
We were originally planning on renting an apartment, but the more we discuss moving there, the more we want to stay there after school. We both have job security there as well for when we graduate. I graduate in 1.5 years, my husband and H graduate in 4 more years (both dual majoring). My husband doesn't want to move inbetween semesters, so once we move we will be living in that place for at least 4 years.

The more I think about renting, the more I dislike it. I don't like the idea of putting money towards rent and never owning, when we could buy a new construction property in the area for the same cost. I understand renting is more 'secure' if something major happened to the place, but I'd really like to own, have equity, and do what I wish to my home.

Husband and I discuss this often as we plan to move early 2020, and his biggest worry is the unfairness for H. He feels like H is getting the worst deal because he's helping us pay for mortgage without owning any of the property. Husband and I also couldn't come up with an agreement on how we would set up rent, I said maybe 45/55 depending on bedroom sizes, husband says 30/70 because H will have no equity, but that sounds crazy! We have not brought this up to H yet, as too much is in the air. Even though, H is really chill about everything else housing wise we've talked about and didn't care if we split an apartment 50/50, including utilities, though we would get the master. We've even discussed a 3rd bedroom being the work room for my husband and H, and any extra storage/garage for H (if we buy, the house would have at least 2 garage spots though). 

If it matters: our budget is $1,400 when looking at apartments, split 50/50 with roommate. But for mortgages, we've been pre-approved for mortgages no more than $12-1300/month with insurance and taxes included in the monthly mortgage.

We are curious, what would be a good price to charge for rent in this scenario? Would it be bad of us to discuss buying/building a home instead of getting an apartment like we first discussed to H?

I am 27 years old and currently live in the US. Originally I'm from Europe, so that's also where most of my savings are. 

I have around 85,000$ (75,000€) in my savings in my European bank account. I have around 30,000$ here in my bank and am currently too afraid to do something with it. I'm working as a freelancer and since I moved not too long ago I am not too sure on how the situation will be so I'd rather use my 30k as an emergency fund. I do not have any debt and a good credit score.

I am super risk averse and if I could, I would stack my money under my bed so I can see it all the time (not literally, but that's how I feel about the situation).

I realized that it might be smart to invest at least a part of my money in Europe, which is currently just sitting around in my bank account with a very low return rate (0.1% as far as I know).

I love this subreddit and tried to find something right for me in the guidelines, but every person has a different story and without enough knowledge I'm even more afraid to invest my money into something I am not sure of. 

I recently had a talk with my bank guy and he told me to invest 20k in something with almost no return - I think the maximum is a 1.5% but without any risk. I did say yes to that - now in retrospect I am not sure if that was a smart idea. The money can always be taken out but depending on the market I might lose a bit. 

I currently do not have a retirement plan (I graduated from university two years ago, then moved and had many other costs coming up - hence no retirement plan atm). 

Any advice on how to handle my situation would be highly appreciated.

I am currently looking to replace my wife’s car. It’s an older ‘06 American made vehicle, and rust has gotten the better of it. We’re looking to buy a 2-3 year old Honda or Subaru, and I plan on this being our only car loan until it’s paid off.

We’re currently shopping for the best deal on True Car, and hopefully find a vehicle nearby. We have another car loan for my vehicle with about $1500 left on it, but we may not be able to wait until it’s paid off to purchase her a replacement. I have a few questions that I need to consider, and any advice/ reasoning would be greatly appreciated!

1) Should I pay off my loan first so the banks see I have less owed or does this not make a difference? We have the money, but would prefer to make the next several payments rather than pay it off immediately if it has no impact on the next purchase.

2) Should I get prequalified for a loan first at a credit union, or do this at the car dealership?

3) Any experience with True Car? They seem like a good source of info. I’ve also been looking into Carvana. Some people seem to love it, others have had bad experiences. Either way I just want to get the best deal. 

4) What are the perks to buying at a local dealership as opposed to one further away? I don’t mind traveling 50-100 miles to get the right deal if it’s a one time thing. 

5) Should I put my wife and myself both on the loan? I have excellent credit (Credit Karma estimates 780-800) and 7+ years of history. My income ranges 55,000 - 65,000. My wife doesn’t work currently, and her credit is estimated between 700-730 on credit karma. I’d like to help her build more credit in case anything ever happens to me. But I also don’t want to pay higher interest rates if I can avoid them.

I havnt checked my credit but I'm sure it's shit because I've apparently had a loan I had no idea about for nearly 3 years. My parents and I no longer talk and despite my dad being a cosigner on these has not paid a penny. A pretty decent portion of the leftover 500 is taxes and a 401k and I barely make a net 350/mo which goes to random expenses/doctor bills/anxiety/depression meds and whatever else as they happen. Besides finding a better paying job (which I'm doing desperately) how can I make my situation better? I have been trying to find out who the hell is in charge of my mystery loans but every # I have gotten leads to another and the one I *thought* might be right had me pick up to a lady who was like ""how did you even get this #, I don't do anything with that"" and they proceed to transfer me to a line that I have waited up to an hour on hold for with no answer.

2000-530-400-200-250-120= 500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I havnt checked my credit but I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s shit because I&amp;#39;ve apparently had a loan I had no idea about for nearly 3 years. My parents and I no longer talk and despite my dad being a cosigner on these has not paid a penny. A pretty decent portion of the leftover 500 is taxes and a 401k and I barely make a net 350/mo which goes to random expenses/doctor bills/anxiety/depression meds and whatever else as they happen. Besides finding a better paying job (which I&amp;#39;m doing desperately) how can I make my situation better? I have been trying to find out who the hell is in charge of my mystery loans but every # I have gotten leads to another and the one I &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; might be right had me pick up to a lady who was like &amp;quot;how did you even get this #, I don&amp;#39;t do anything with that&amp;quot; and they proceed to transfer me to a line that I have waited up to an hour on hold for with no answer. I don&amp;#39;t even know what to start.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm new to personal financing as a 28 year old making $105,000 and really wanna look into investing.

Been applying to jobs the past few weeks and the interviews are starting to snowball in and I'm having trouble finding time to commit. I'll get that sorted out but need advice on how to handle offers.

&amp;#x200B;

I received a highly competitive offer from Company A. Benefits are great (11% match). It's also a non-profit so my student loans will continue to be enrolled in the PSLF program. 17 days of PTO. Low deductible healthcare plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Company B is a tech company, I have a in-person interview late next week. I believe their offer will be slightly higher (\~5-10k), healthcare 100% paid for, 4% match, unlimited PTO but a for-profit company which means my student loans will not be forgiven.

&amp;#x200B;

Company C is also a tech company. I am the final and only candidate I believe. I will be receiving an offer but they are relatively young and almost too close to being a startup. (50 employees, series B funding in 2017). I expect the compensation to be close to company A.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 40k in student loans with 7 years left until forgiveness.

I'd say company B is much more on the forefront of technologies and available tools for my career.

&amp;#x200B;

**I think I should lean towards Company A but I need advice on how to handle if/when the offer letters come in from B and C? Should I further negotiate if the pay is any different? Also how long can I hold off on signing an offer letter if I have already received it and should I be upfront about my situation?**

&lt;p&gt;FYI I already Max out my 401K and Roth IRA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankyou&lt;/p&gt;

Wife had surgery late last year.  Her work gave her FMLA and paid her through April her full pay.  They said after April she had to go on short term disability and receive 60% of her pay.  They put in all the paperwork and sent it over to Unum who approved it.  

Well the first week that we received payment from Unum, she found another job and put in her two weeks.  She told them to cancel short term disability because she wouldn't need it anymore since she's leaving the company.  They confirmed it and said the paperwork was sent in. 

The week she started her new job we saw a new deposit in our account from Unum for one week's salary.  So my wife called up her old company and questioned it.  They told her the paperwork was sent in already and it should have stopped.  So she called Unum directly and they said it was an error on their part and they will withdraw it back.  

So we waited two weeks and nothing happened.  My wife who works in finance said they have two weeks to withdraw money from our account before the bank won't allow them to do it so since they went past that date, another arrangement needed to be made.  So she called Unum back and asked them why wasn't it taken out of our account.  They told her they have no record of it and no record of talking to her before on it and to them they see everything as perfect on their end.  

So we chalk it up as they will find it when they audit themselves and to keep that money in our savings account so we don't spend it.  

Well six weeks pass.  She's enjoying her new job.  Making $10k more per year and she loves the work.  I check our bank account and low and behold, another Unum payment for one weeks salary.  I tell my wife who flips out.  She works in finance and knows someone really screwed up here.  So she calls her old work and tells them.  They have no record of doing anything.  So she calls Unum and asks them what is going on.  Unum tells her that paperwork was sent in and approved for six weeks short term disability.  She tells them she hasn't worked at that company for over six weeks.  Unum said there's nothing they can do because her old company approved it.  She tells them to stop payments and to take the money back out.  

So we wait another two weeks and they never do it again.  The money is still in there.  So we move it to savings again so we don't spend it.

My question is.. will their audit system find this?  I mean they said my wife's old company approved the disability so Unum thinks these two payments are 100% valid.

US: Illinois - Chicago, near suburbs
37 y/o; soon-to-be-officially-single dad. Two elementary age kids, living with me half time.

income: 55k 
Savings: currently about 20k, I anticipate about 10k after divorce is final.
No debt at all once this house sells (car is paid off in one more payment, CC balances are paid in full every month)
If it matters, excellent (825+) credit.

This was the first home I've ever bought, so it's the first one I'll ever sell. Currently the difference between our sale price (after broker fees, lawyer fees, etc.) minus the remaining principal is about $120k. Divided in half (soon-to-be-ex-wife gets the other half), that's 60k. Do I walk away with all of that? Is there anything I'm missing? Is it taxed? If so, how do I estimate how much? Also if taxed, is it at time of sale or on my tax return after the end of this year?

Onto the rent budget question (with the above info in mind):

I've never been the most educated about budgeting, etc. I've always been fortunate enough to have a lifestyle-income ratio that made it so I didn't have to pay super close attention to budgeting.

Without having a clear sense of what my future budget was going to look like, I ballparked my rent budget until now (only went under contract on the home last week) at ideally 1500-1600, but willing to go to 1900, especially if some utilities, parking, or some other perk was included. Everything I'm finding in that range, though, is missing some of the things I want for my kids and me in our new home. On a personal values level, having a comfortable home for us is a big priority for me, but obviously I'm limited by my budget.

If my earlier assumptions are correct (I'm walking away with 60k take home, plus my already existing savings), can I afford to increase my rent budget to 2500/mo? I know this is WAY over the 1/3 of income rule of thumb but....

My figuring is this: One year at that increased rent will be an extra $7,000 (approx) paid in rent (over my previous top-of-budget). I still have over $50k of my profit on my house, and have had a year to figure out if that housing expense is sustainable with my new lifestyle post-divorce.

Would love to hear any thoughts/insights.

Also, I know that if I pay tax on that home sale, that changes things significantly.

Divided in half (soon-to-be-ex-wife gets the other half), that&amp;#39;s 60k. Do I walk away with all of that? Is there anything I&amp;#39;m missing? Is it taxed? If so, how do I estimate how much? Also if taxed, is it at time of sale or on my tax return after the end of this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the rent budget question (with the above info in mind):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never been the most educated about budgeting, etc. I&amp;#39;ve always been fortunate enough to have a lifestyle-income ratio that made it so I didn&amp;#39;t have to pay super close attention to budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without having a clear sense of what my future budget was going to look like, I ballparked my rent budget until now (only went under contract on the home last week) at ideally 1500-1600, but willing to go to 1900, especially if some utilities, parking, or some other perk was included. Everything I&amp;#39;m finding in that range, though, is missing some of the things I want for my kids and me in our new home. On a personal values level, having a comfortable home for us is a big priority for me, but obviously I&amp;#39;m limited by my budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my earlier assumptions are correct (I&amp;#39;m walking away with 60k take home, plus my already existing savings), can I afford to increase my rent budget to 2500/mo? I know this is WAY over the 1/3 of income rule of thumb but....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My figuring is this: One year at that increased rent will be an extra $7,000 (approx) paid in rent (over my previous top-of-budget). I still have over $50k of my profit on my house, and have had a year to figure out if that housing expense is sustainable with my new lifestyle post-divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would love to hear any thoughts/insights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I know that if I pay tax on that home sale, that changes things significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m sure it’d be awesome to be old and retired with a huge lump sum to make me comfortable. I just fear looking back and regretting life because I had no experiences or adventures.

So is a truck and a boat plausible in my situation for next summer?

Income: 
After taxes, health insurance, and 6% to retirement, I take home $7,000/mo

Rent: $1,300/mo

Bills: $300 (Does not include car insurance as paid in full all the way to June 2020 already)

Food: $400/mo

Now debts...
Car: $9,600 with monthly payments of $306 at 1.84% interest. At that rate, I’m thinking about continuing minimum payments or kick it up $350.

Credit Card: $7,000. I’ve designated $3,000 each month to come out of my paycheck the next 2 months so this WILL be paid in full no later than October.

Student Loans: $120,000 at $1,400/mo. Currently in process of refinancing from 6.14% to 5.4%. I still feel like I can beat 5.4%.

This is where I know I am wrong. I have no emergency fund. I’m being cocky and arrogant in this regard in that I am very fortunate with parents that have $$$ and would easily give me if something were to happen. I do work in specialized field in healthcare that does not get laid off and am in demand. I suppose I could get fired for negligence, but I go into work with patient first aspect and am not that type of person that is a lazy worker.

Checking/Savings: $150. I’ve been throwing all my cash into debt. Feel like I’m better off getting rid of debt rather than putting money away in savings outside of retirement. Don’t know see how I can get a better return right now than the piece of mind of watching a 6%, $120k crater leave my name.

Fire away PF! I need brutal and honest truth. 

Also apologize for length and formatting. Doing this on mobile so not sure how it is going to look for everybody.

Thank you

Edit: Thank you to everyone for the brutal honesty. I needed to come back to my senses. I’ll continue to my dreaming.

Just for the record to clear my name, I swear I am not an impulse buyer anymore. It was years ago and have been repairing the damage. Trust me, that $7,000 credit card debt was much bigger before. I regret it big time. I already made the mistake in the past and not going to do it again.

Was never able to save til now, just started a great job a few months ago.

Income: $3,300 Month, this is net income

Car Debt: $16,000. This is over the next 5 years. Was a six year loan for $19,000, very low interest sub 3.

Credit Card Debt: $2,000. This is on a zero interest credit card, at least for now. I want to attack this first just to get rid of the balance.

Total Debt: $18,000 (no student loans)

Savings: Just a few hundred

Retirement: Nothing, but just opened a Roth IRA. Job does not offer a 401K.

Credit Score: 790, if this is needed at all.

Trying to save for a House in a couple years and also trying to get all debt paid off. Houses in this area are about $330k, so want to put 5% down. That's around 10K each saved for my fiancee and I in the next two years.

&amp;#x200B;

Expenses:

Rent $580.00 (split house rent with fiancee)

Car Payment $275.00

Car Insurance $130

Power $85.00

Water $60.00

Cell Phone $50.00

Haircut $30.00

Gas $15.00

Car Gas $225.00 (commute)

Internet $25

Youtube Red $10

Credit Card $250 (in order to get paid off before interest hits)

Dog Expenses $70.00 (No kid expenses yet thankfully lol)

Gym $20.00

Roth IRA $100.00  (Will raise this to $500.00 once have enough saved for House Down Payment and Car Paid Off)

Emergency Savings $175.00

Travel $150.00

Food $300.00

Take Out $100.00

House Down Payment Savings $400.00

Extra Car Payment $300.00

Total

&amp;#x200B;

$3,350.00

&amp;#x200B;

This obviously leaves me with no spending money which isn't realistic. Should I not pay extra on my car until the Credit Card Debt is paid off? Which will be just 6-7 months. Then I would have $250-300 of spending money to work around with

At a meeting about 2-3 weeks ago my boss remarked that I’ve been putting in extra time and there could be some extra compensation for me, hourly or a lump sum if I wanted it. I asked to think about it.

He didn’t respond right away but asked me to stay after a meeting yesterday and said that would be fine, I can just email him the number of hours and he’d add to my paycheck. But then he said that while some managers just put in their 8 hours a day, others put in much more and the ones who rise through the company the fastest are the ones who work more.

I will try to make a long story as short as I can. Have had a collection on my credit report for nearly 5 years from an apartment I lived at 7 years ago.

Come to find the property was bought out just after I moved, and they were hitting up old tenants with the expenses of updating units. IE: New trim around door, painting front door, new dishwasher, new faucets etc. Ridiculous things.

And have also tried to work with Hunter Warfield years ago, without admitting ownership. They would never agree to any type of proof of payment, or anything in writing. Recently, this account got me denied for a condo. Which is the only reason why I am not waiting for it to fall off on its own.

I recently took a job opportunity in Philadelphia for a 40% pay increase raising me and my wife's average combined income to 100k/yr. My home is in the suburbs 2 hours away and for the last 2 months I have been commuting 2 hours to work, working 8 hours, then commuting 2 hours home. It's starting to wear me down and I am trying to determine if it would make more financial sense to rent a room in the city during the work week? Job opportunities closer to where we live are far and few between and relocating is not an option. Weighing all opportunity costs,  I am also not keen on job hopping anytime soon as my industry/company in particular will be the fastest way to reach a 6 figure income and clean up all of our debt. 

Net Income: $5,700-6,000/mo

Expenses: \~$4,200/mo

Total Debt:

180k mortgage

50k student loans

10k car note

5k credit card debt

Budget:

$1500 mortgage

$204 train ticket

$500 gas

$200 utilities 

$200 student loans

$236 car payment

$162 car insurance

$300 credit card payments

$300 food

$400 misc.

$150 pets

$100 health insurance

&amp;#x200B;

I commute 100 miles a day, 4-5 days a week spending \~$60-90/week on gas, averages around to $300/mo for my car alone.

Then $205/mo for a train ticket into the city from the station. So my total commuting cost is $505/mo not counting wear and tear on my car/oil changes.

If I were to live in the city during the week, my wife and I would trade in both of our cars for one car, eliminating my $236/mo car payment. She would drop me to and from the station at the beginning and end of the week and use the car all week as I wouldn't need it in the city. As I would only need to rent from Mon-Thurs night and would be home Fri-Sun, I could feasibly find a room for $400-450/mo with utilities included. A monthly train pass within city/adjacent suburb limits is $175/mo on top of rent. My cost to stay in the city would be $600-$650/mo.

From a purely financial perspective, would it make more sense to continue commuting, or staying in the city during the work week? Please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to lay out where I'm at currently and some aspirations I have in the next few years and see if this is a feasible option financially. I am 21 years old and graduated university last December. I have a little less than a month's worth of expenses in savings ($800). Thankfully I have a decent job, live in a small town, and have cheap rent with roommates, meaning I can save quite a bit while I am here. My monthly income is around $1150, and with only about $850-900 in expenses, meaning even if I overspend a bit here and there I can reasonably put $200 per month into savings. I also have been receiving back child support payments from my ever-absent father (which recently have been about $50 a week,  but formerly had been as much as $60-70) but I have no basis for how much left/longer he has to pay on that or how consistently I will get it, so I just put it into savings and don't count it as part of my income for budgeting purposes. Thankfully my student loans only total just under $10,000 so that monthly payment is very manageable, and I have been considering adding more than the minimum payment to get that out of the way a little faster (especially as I currently get more income than expected per month with child support payments).  


Here is the catch: I don't want to stay here forever. In college I did a semester abroad in South America and loved it; I had traveled before and I have known for years that I want to live abroad. I am very interested in teaching English potentially and I have been furiously researching and reading r/TEFL, as well as watching videos and reading info from people who are experts in the area (Ben Teaches English Abroad is one that comes to mind). Looking at potential routes and job placements, I think the earliest I would possibly go is February/March 2020. I am hoping that I can increase my savings base to at least $2500 or more by that time. Even if I had to wait until a few months later, I could build a bigger savings and be more comfortable before I go. I feel like I would be doing well to have enough in a US account to cover my student loan payments for the year, as well as airfare and at least a month of (US rate) expenses should an emergency happen that requires me to head home early.   


I know that the big bucks/salaries are in Asia, but my heart is in South America and that's really where I'd like to go. Looking at some potential contracts, I think I could save $100-200 per month in most places that I may go. (Income is much lower, but cost of living is also much lower). If I decide that I like that job/career path, I can keep up with it, keep travelling, keep building my savings and paying off my loans, and potentially move into countries/roles that would pay me more and allow me to be more comfortable financially. Even if I come home not planning to return to that field, I feel like I would be OK as I would have that savings to fall back on and I could begin in a different direction.

I've just recently in the past few months started looking at my financial future and looking at my options to invest. At the moment I've just been looking at less-risk options like high-interest savings accounts, CD accounts, and possibly even index funds.

My current finances are:

$19k in a checking account

$5k in cash

&amp;#x200B;

I just graduated college with no debt, having attended a four-year university while commuting from home, and we're low-income so state/federal financial aid grants covered all my expenses. I've also been able to save \~85% of my earnings at my current job due to it being reasonably high-paying ($28+/hour after factoring in taxes and tips).

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the thing: my first post-grad job is a 6 month temporary (but possibly permanent) assignment in Hawaii that starts in a few weeks. My rent is $1000/month, and beyond just leisurely expenses and rent, I don't expect to be spending much beyond that. Pay is $22.12/hour, 40+ hours a week. I'm also receiving a lump sum relocation expenses payment of $1500, as well as a $2500 signing bonus. Within four years, if all goes well I expect to earn \~$70-80k salary/year. I also plan on living at my parent's home for at least another 5 years, if my work permits me to stay local.

&amp;#x200B;

My current short/long term financial goals are to save enough money for a 30-40% down payment on a house within 10 years to afford a two bedroom, 1 or 2 bathroom house/condo somewhere in Southern California (I'm currently based near downtown LA). With the two bedroom unit, I also plan on renting out the extra bedroom to help cover mortgage costs. My monkey brain also tells me to want to buy a decent two-door ""sports car"", as I do consider myself an automotive enthusiast and enjoy those kinds of things. Obviously making a $20-30k purchase on a depreciating asset is by far not the best decision to make right after college.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you all have any general advice for me? Are my financial goals a bit too far-reaching? What would you suggest to me, a complete novice when it comes to making investments? Should I stick to low-risk investments for now, and then possibly down the road get into more high-risk options?

They are notorious for  not hiring people so I'm almost 100% sure they aren't going to hire  another person to help me out. My work also never has yearly reviews and  never gives raises unless asked and even then they just give inflation  based raises. So how much do you think I should ask for a raise? I mean  they are saving like $50,000  by not hiring someone else so I'd like to  ask for a $20,000 raise but I doubt that's likely after reading may of  the posts on here.

I am a recent college grad with a degree in advertising and I posted on here not too long ago about advertising jobs in Phoenix. 

The market for advertising is much too small in Phoenix and looking in a bigger city would be better. So I took your advice and my girlfriend and I are moving to Seattle! She’s from there originally and she’s heading back to get settled with her new job and find us an apartment. 

Meanwhile, I’m working and saving up some money and I will be making the move to join her hopefully before the years end. My problem though is trying to secure a job up in Seattle when I don’t have the funds to fly up for job interviews. So I have decided that I need to move up there in order to be physically present for the job hunt. 

As a 22 year old new college grad who is trying to figure everything out, what affairs would I need to secure in order financially to get up there? I am sorry if this is a stupid question, but I’m new to this whole adulting thing.

I have recently graduated and am moving to downtown Chicago for a job this fall.  My job requires adequate transportation outside of the public transportation in case I have for example a client in a suburb or outside of the city.  In most cases, I will be using the train to get to work, especially if I will only be going to my office. 

I currently have a Honda that I purchased about a year ago for well below its blue book value (~5k).  The other day I put it up on Craigslist just to see what I could get for it and have been offered $8k for it.  I am a little hesitant on if I should sell it mainly because it's a reliable car in great shape.  However, since I will mainly be using public transport while in Chicago, I feel that I could use this money elsewhere.  My dad said I should sell it and buy another car for 5k and pocket the difference (less the taxes on the gain). I could then use that money to help fund my move/invest.

Thank you all for taking the time to read this. This community is incredible.

FYI I’ve created a throwaway account for personal reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Details**

27M

Single but hope to marry and have children

&amp;#x200B;

**The Situation**

I am leaving a good, stable career with high future earning potential. Current position – $75k salary in major city with low COL. Have been in current role for almost 2.5 years and can expect raise/promotion within a year. Maybe to $85-90k. To make a guess – it would not be at all surprising to be making $150k within 10 years – assuming good performance.

Leaving for a 2-year full time grad program (tier 1 school, top 10 program, great network) in another major city with higher COL which will leave me with $60k in debt. Masters essentially required for entry level positions in this new field. Very likely that I work in public or non-profit sectors upon graduation. The goal is to return to my home city (low COL) after the program. Expected salary directly after graduation $55-60k. Expected salary 2 years post-graduation $75k (right back where I started). In 10 years, it would be a very pleasant surprise if I was making $150k – likely hovering around $100k (and would expect this to be the ceiling).

Clearly from a financial perspective, this is not a good investment. This is your typical “I need to find fulfillment; my soul is dying!” career shift. Much can be debated, reflected upon, etc. on this topic. Grass isn’t always greener and stuff. I get it and I’m prepared mentally to be wrong about this venture. I’ve been through years of therapy (not for any explicit mental health disorder) and have researched/planned for this change for a couple years – though, admittedly I still I haven’t done enough. Not here for this conversation but something more specific. See questions below

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial stats not previously mentioned above**

Savings = $17k

401k = $40k (fully vested)

Undergrad debt = $9.5k ($6.5k at 3.4%; $3k at 3.86%)

No house

No car payment

790 credit score

&amp;#x200B;

**At School I expect…**

To make enough between part-time jobs and summer internship to cover rent and necessary living expenses. The $60k expected debt considers this/scholarship/health insurance/books and supplies but does not consider any usage of my savings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Goal**

Buy a house by 32, or 3 years post-graduation. $180k buys a nice home in the city I intend to be living in.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions**

How do I handle my existing undergrad debt? Defer or continue to make full payments? I likely cannot work enough during school to fund this (as well as rent, living expenses).

How might I best plan to meet my goal of buying a house in 5 years? Completely unrealistic? Paying off my student loans as soon as is possible is certainly important, especially to prevent burdening potential SO and children.

Is there a creative way to use partially use my 401k? Considering my age and that these funds would ultimately assist in purchasing a home?

It’s very, very possible that I work at either a non-profit or with government for 10 years. Would it be advisable to plan to utilize the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Do I run the risk of denial into the program and adding significantly to my debt by using one of the federal repayment plans?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I’ve provided enough meat here for you all to sink your teeth into. Any responses, opinions, advice are very much appreciated. I’ll do my best to respond to questions.

&lt;p&gt;How do I handle my existing undergrad debt? Defer or continue to make full payments? I likely cannot work enough during school to fund this (as well as rent, living expenses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might I best plan to meet my goal of buying a house in 5 years? Completely unrealistic? Paying off my student loans as soon as is possible is certainly important, especially to prevent burdening potential SO and children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a creative way to use partially use my 401k? Considering my age and that these funds would ultimately assist in purchasing a home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very, very possible that I work at either a non-profit or with government for 10 years. Would it be advisable to plan to utilize the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Do I run the risk of denial into the program and adding significantly to my debt by using one of the federal repayment plans?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I’ve provided enough meat here for you all to sink your teeth into. Any responses, opinions, advice are very much appreciated. I’ll do my best to respond to questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all very, very, very much.&lt;/p&gt;

For years, I've held the following mix of cards to try and maximize cash back rewards:

* Discover It (5% categories)
* Chase Freedom (5% categories)
* AMEX Everyday Blue Cash (3% groceries, 2% gas)
* Citi Double Cash (2% on everything)
* Wells Fargo Cash Wise (1.5% on everything \[used exclusively at Costco, which only accepts Visa\])

&amp;#x200B;

Every quarter, I write up a cards to put in my wallet and my wife's billfold relating which is the optimal card to use for various types of expenses that quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

However, we've reached a point where it feels like we need to simplify.  I'm considering going down to just one personal card, and one card for our small business.  Both cards would need to be Visa due to our frequenting of Costco, which only accepts Visa.

&amp;#x200B;

The small business card feels simple - there's the Captial One Spark Business card, which is a Visa and gets 2% on everything.

&amp;#x200B;

The personal card feels a little more complicated.  I'm considering going with the Chase Freedom Unlimited, at least for a year, as it gets 3% on everything for the first year, and then reevaluating as that year runs out.  I haven't done the math on how much we'd need to spend to make that 3% bonus rate more advantageous than other enrollment period bonuses  out there (like $150 for $500 spent in 1st 3 months on Quicksilver, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

Any insights would be much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of context. I'm a 22yo living with his parents. I'm in Business School, specializing in Entrepreneurship on the weekends. I just got a new job (internship) that pays almost 3x what I was making before, but it's also further away from where I live and study, so I'll have around 2:30 to 3h in public transport everyday, compared to the 20 min I had before. That means I have little to no free time during the week, and part of the weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

I own a car that my father gave to me. I love it, but I sometimes feel it's a little too much for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to use my car everyday. With this new job, I don't think I'll be able to use my car during the week, so it would be basically a weekend car only. We only have one parking spot where we live, so we're currently paying a decent sum of money for a parking spot a couple of blocks away, so it's expensive and a pain to walk there everytime I have to use my car.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my father pays for all the costs of the car. He's not exactly complaining, but I'm sure he would be grateful if I reduced a few of those costs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a serious internal debate now. Having a car gives me the freedom to go anywhere I want with little trouble, and I might still use my car for work once in a while. But having an ""expensive"" car with little use feels a bit like a waste to me.

&amp;#x200B;

As a reference, my car is worth around R$ 53.000 on the used market (\~US$ 15.000, or around 53 minimum wages here). I could sell my car, Uber around when needed and invest the money (even to purchase another car when I feel the need to have one). Or I could sell my car and purchase a cheaper, smaller one that I could leave parked on the street. Or maybe just keep it, since my father is willing to cover the costs of maintaining the car?

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone faced a similar situation, selling their car due to not being able to use it enough? I really enjoy driving, so that's kind of a big factor for me as well :(

Just joined and it looks like there are those with some valuable advice out there that could be very useful. 

I currently work for a large Aerospace company as a Project Manager and make $80k-$90k a year supporting a family of 4 in one of the highest housing markets in the country, so that salary isn’t going as far it it would in the cheaper states in the country. I’d like my wife to stay home with the kids because of all the benefits that go along with her doing that, so I’d like to have an income that will help provide the best I can for my family. 

I’m 27 years old with about 8 years of experience in Manufacturing, 5 in aerospace and a few in Management before I joined my current employer. 

I am interested in getting my BS in Computer Science or Software Development (That my current employer will pay for). I have a Masters degree in Leadership from a state college and a BS in business. I chose those majors because I hate math and know the two degrees I’m considering are going to have me get into Calc and all that not so fun stuff. 

The questions are:

Do you think that struggling for 2-3 years with the math will pay off as far as employment offers are concerned? I’d like to get an offer for more than I’m currently making so that I won’t skip a beat with my financial goals. 

Would staying in my current role and getting various certifications over the course of the next few years be better if it would get me to the $100k-$110k range? (Probably not making more than $120k-$130k over the next 10-15 years, that seems like the cap for my program) 

Thanks for all your help and sorry if I’ve left out an info that would help provide some advice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey All,&lt;/p&gt;

The car should be paid off in 1-2 months time opening up another $237 approx left over.

I am probably in a more enviable position then most but I get frustrated that I haven't been able to make as much progress on our new house as I would like.

- What percentage makes sense to sell when the employee lockup expires to balance risk? I recall guidance to not let a single stock make up more than 10% of your portfolio, but selling so much makes me worry about taxes, especially because of this next point:  
- I paid tax on the equity based on the IPO list price, and shared were withheld on my behalf. The current price is ~40% higher than the list price, and I believe selling this year would realize those gains as short-term, while I can realize them as long-term if I wait to sell in Q2 of 2020. Does it make sense to avoid selling for another ~6 months? I almost see the change in taxes on the appreciation  as a hedge for a drop in the stock price.

- Current vested equity: ~700K at current share price, tax already withheld at ~53% (Fed, CA, Social Security)&lt;br/&gt;
- Net-worth: ~230K: [170K in 401K, 40k in ETFs, 20K emergency fund,  no debt.]  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big questions I have:&lt;br/&gt;
- What percentage makes sense to sell when the employee lockup expires to balance risk? I recall guidance to not let a single stock make up more than 10% of your portfolio, but selling so much makes me worry about taxes, especially because of this next point:&lt;br/&gt;
- I paid tax on the equity based on the IPO list price, and shared were withheld on my behalf. The current price is ~40% higher than the list price, and I believe selling this year would realize those gains as short-term, while I can realize them as long-term if I wait to sell in Q2 of 2020. Does it make sense to avoid selling for another ~6 months? I almost see the change in taxes on the appreciation  as a hedge for a drop in the stock price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the help here!&lt;/p&gt;

I was a full time student for a few years but I now have a sustainable income of about $2700 and recently inherited a large sum of money(\~$15,000).

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on using the inheritance to pay off two of my credit cards with the highest interest and part of my 3rd credit card.  This would leave me at $15,000 left on the credit card with the lowest interest rate (12.2%).  

&amp;#x200B;

My monthly expenses:

Utilities - $110

Internet - $55

Cell - $55

Food - $120

Gas - $100

Car insurance - $135

TOTAL = $575

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves me with a decent amount of left over money so I wanted to know what would be a good amount of money to put towards the debt each month?  I realize I should pay as much as I can afford, but what would be the recommended amount to keep in savings?  I have about $3,000 in savings at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the credit cards I have is a 'cash rewards' so is it possible to make payments with the cash rewards card and then pay it off immediately and still receive the rewards?  Or would it just be better to just pay straight from my checkings/savings account?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, my credit score has obviously taken quite a hit and has fallen from around 775 to 615.  My utilization is about 90% right now ($30,000 of $34,000).  I am trying to raise my score as quickly as possible so would you guys recommend getting another credit card to purely lower the utilization percentage?

I was a full time student for a few years but I now have a sustainable income of about $2700 and recently inherited a large sum of money(~$15,000).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan on using the inheritance to pay off two of my credit cards with the highest interest and part of my 3rd credit card.  This would leave me at $15,000 left on the credit card with the lowest interest rate (12.2%).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My monthly expenses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utilities - $110&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet - $55&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cell - $55&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food - $120&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gas - $100&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Car insurance - $135&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOTAL = $575&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves me with a decent amount of left over money so I wanted to know what would be a good amount of money to put towards the debt each month?  I realize I should pay as much as I can afford, but what would be the recommended amount to keep in savings?  I have about $3,000 in savings at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the credit cards I have is a &amp;#39;cash rewards&amp;#39; so is it possible to make payments with the cash rewards card and then pay it off immediately and still receive the rewards?  Or would it just be better to just pay straight from my checkings/savings account?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, my credit score has obviously taken quite a hit and has fallen from around 775 to 615.  My utilization is about 90% right now ($30,000 of $34,000).  I am trying to raise my score as quickly as possible so would you guys recommend getting another credit card to purely lower the utilization percentage?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

It appears that a part of the hot water heater broke and was allowed to pour out water continuously until the water was shut off. After submitting a claim with insurance on my HO6 policy (this is a townhome and the outside is covered by the association's insurance) had a remediation crew come out to remove the water damaged areas, suck up the water and dry everything out.

&amp;nbsp;  
  
* Make an emergency account  
* Make a savings account  
* Make a retirement account  
* Invest  

&amp;nbsp;  
  
I have absolutely no background on finance, so all of the terms and different types of accounts and things confuses me a lot. I have questions about each of these areas and hoping someone will be kind enough to help me understand. 
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Making an emergency account**  
I see that making a tiered emergency account is advised as per [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/22s5iz/where_should_i_keep_our_6month_emergency_fund/cgptw4u/). My first question is why is it advised to split your emergency fund like that? Your emergency fund is for emergencies, so wouldn't you want it all in one place for quick and easy access in the case of an emergency? Is it because Roth offers more interest, followed by savings, followed by checking, but withdrawing money from those accounts also has a higher cost descending in that order? So tiering it offers the most money gain in the end assuming that you’ll never encounter an emergency where you’re required to dip into your Roth? Also, when an emergency occurs, how should you go about using the money if it's tiered? Clear your checking, then move to savings, then move to your retirement fund (that's what a Roth IRA is, right?)? Finally, in the comment he talks about I-bonds and VSCGX, which look like investments to me if I’m understanding this correctly. But on the wiki page, it says you shouldn’t invest your emergency funds, so either I don’t understand what I-bonds and VSCGX are (if that’s the case, please help me understand) or there are conflicting views on whether or not you should invest your emergency funds, in which case it comes down to preference?  
    
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Making a savings account**  
A retirement account is a form of a savings account, correct? Am I supposed to have a savings account (like at the local bank) as well as a retirement account? Would the only purpose of it be to hold emergency funds of about 50% of it if I tier my emergency funds? In that case, the most important factor in choosing a savings account would be accessibility, since you likely won’t have a balance big enough for the small interest difference between banks to matter much?  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Making a retirement account**  
Due to the overseas earned income exclusion, it looks like I’m not eligible to open an IRA, Roth, or 401k. I do however, get pension upon leaving the country, the first of which I used to take down my student loan. To clarify, I move countries/employers every few years. What are my options for building a retirement fund? Should I just stick to a typical savings account? Investopedia says brokerage accounts are one alternative. However, it also says that firms that offer guidance and counseling (which I will probably need since I’m so lost in the economic world) usually have a hefty fee. Should I just invest (I-bonds and CDs?) the money that I would have otherwise put into a retirement account? 
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
**Investing**  
For I-bonds, I basically give them money, they hold it for a maximum of 30 years, and then they give me my money back plus interest? It’s that simple? I see that you can buy a maximum of $10k I-bonds per year. If I spend $10k over 2 years, do I have 2 I-bonds worth $10k, or one I-bond worth $20k? Is it advisable to buy I-bonds every year in this fashion? Is I-bond a company product or its own entity? As in, do different companies offer different I-bond rates, or is I-bond its own thing and every I-bond will be treated equally?  
For CDs, does every big bank offer them? If so, I’m assuming each bank has different rates, correct? And to make sure I understand the concept correctly, the basic principal is like this:  
- If I invest $5, they give me $1 each month.  
- I invest $25 ($5x5). This nets me $5.  
- I add the new $5 to my original investment (now $30).  
- This nets me $6 the next month.  
And this continues for as long as you’d like. Adding your earnings to your base investment to further increase your earnings is where the “ladder” comes from, correct?  
For now, I’m only interested in safe long-term investments as I want to get all my chicks in a row before trying to learn aggressive investing. Is this a good way to go about it? Or should I start trying to learn how to do that as soon as possible?

So now, obviously, I'm back again to ask for more advice.

My down payment plus closing costs is going to be $130,700, and there's ""a month of rent back, which can probably be applied toward closing costs"" (agent's words), but I don't fully understand that and ""probably"" didn't really convince me, so I'm just going to pretend that money doesn't exist.  I currently have $132,000 in my checking account; we lived on $20,000 annual income from 2007 to 2015 then my income shot up to $100,000 and we didn't change our lifestyle, so we went from scraping by to a robust savings account pretty fast, and I'm pretty sure I can replace the savings by this time next year.

So here's the retirement fund situation: In 2007 I came into some money ($4,000) and early 2008 put it into a Roth IRA and bought Starbucks at $9/share, and I think I've made a couple contributions since then but I forget when or how much.  I would like to use the house as an excuse to pull as much out of retirement as possible to give myself some wiggle room (This is only about 6 months worth of expenses, but I'm not expecting my work situation to change, if it does I'll just go live homeless at the docks or under a bridge or something... LA has a lot of beautiful bridges).

So far I've spoken to my home loan agent, my next door neighbor (CPA), and my dad (landlord since about 1960), and all 3 of them seem to be disagreeing on whether or not my Roth IRA can be used toward my down payment on my house, and none of them seem to know what the actual steps are to getting it done.

My Roth IRA is currently in etrade, I am not sure exactly how much I've contributed and I haven't been able to find the breakdown on their website. I *think* my total cash contributions over the years were $8,000 and my profit on investments is $20,000.  From what I've read online, I should be able to take out $18,000 without penalty ($10,000 of the profit along with the $8,000 original contribution).  However, all 3 of the people I've spoken to tell me that I'm wrong; one of them tells me I can take out all $28,000 no problem, and one of them says it's a hard $10,000 limit.  Additionally, I can't figure out how to tell for sure the exact amount of my initial contribution and I'm worried that if it's, say, $6,000 instead of $8,000 like I remember, that I'll get hit with a bunch of penalties.

So that brings me into the ""steps"" for getting the cash out, and how exactly the penalty works for running over the limit (if there IS a limit, which the home loan agent insists there is not).  Is the penalty a flat fee or a percent?  What's the percent?  Do I just take the money out and then deal with it on my taxes or do I have to notify etrade ahead of time, and if so how does that process work?

I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; my total cash contributions over the years were $8,000 and my profit on investments is $20,000.  From what I&amp;#39;ve read online, I should be able to take out $18,000 without penalty ($10,000 of the profit along with the $8,000 original contribution).  However, all 3 of the people I&amp;#39;ve spoken to tell me that I&amp;#39;m wrong; one of them tells me I can take out all $28,000 no problem, and one of them says it&amp;#39;s a hard $10,000 limit.  Additionally, I can&amp;#39;t figure out how to tell for sure the exact amount of my initial contribution and I&amp;#39;m worried that if it&amp;#39;s, say, $6,000 instead of $8,000 like I remember, that I&amp;#39;ll get hit with a bunch of penalties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that brings me into the &amp;quot;steps&amp;quot; for getting the cash out, and how exactly the penalty works for running over the limit (if there IS a limit, which the home loan agent insists there is not).  Is the penalty a flat fee or a percent?  What&amp;#39;s the percent?  Do I just take the money out and then deal with it on my taxes or do I have to notify etrade ahead of time, and if so how does that process work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: I&amp;#39;m 37 years old&lt;/p&gt;

My dad has had to remortgage the house for reasons I won't go into detail about. He got a mortgage agreement for £78k or thereabouts, 60k to pay the rest of the house, £6k-ish to pay off a debt on the house and then the rest to have some stuff done (new kitchen, porch, decorating etc etc.)

All was happy once the mortgage had been accepted, papers were signed so it was pretty much a waiting game to have mom sign over the house to dad and then get the money.

However, about a week after we got the approval it has come out that 2 more debts are on the house. Why would this have not come out during the process? We are trying to figure out what and how much but right now it's looking pretty bleak.

Im 23 with zero debt and I live at home. I make 52k a year before taxes and i want to purchase a new car. I've been driving my current car which is a 2010 Mazda 3 for close to 7 years now. it has high miles and I'm starting to have to dump money into it.

In a few months I want to trade up to a Hyundai veloster N, this car costs 29,000 before TTR. I put away 1 out of every 2 paychecks I get every month into a charles schwab money market account I use as a ""big boi expense"" account. Money for moving out, new car etc.

I currently have 11k saved and have not touched it since I created it in February. I realize if I buy this car I would have to live at home a bit longer than I originally planned just to save up again.

the plan is to put down around 10k for a down payment, and finance the rest over 60 months. my credit is great, believe its over 760, so getting a low APR isnt going to be an issue.

I realize I should be buying used, but the car is new and there isnt any used ones for sale yet. 

Any input is great. I dont have anyone else to turn to about my finances. Mom is pretty clueless, but she does think I should be buying a used car to reduce depreciation. That was her only input.

Thanks again!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, first post here. Im 23 with zero debt and I live at home. I make 52k a year before taxes and i want to purchase a new car. I&amp;#39;ve been driving my current car which is a 2010 Mazda 3 for close to 7 years now. it has high miles and I&amp;#39;m starting to have to dump money into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few months I want to trade up to a Hyundai veloster N, this car costs 29,000 before TTR. I put away 1 out of every 2 paychecks I get every month into a charles schwab money market account I use as a &amp;quot;big boi expense&amp;quot; account. Money for moving out, new car etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently have 11k saved and have not touched it since I created it in February. I realize if I buy this car I would have to live at home a bit longer than I originally planned just to save up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the plan is to put down around 10k for a down payment, and finance the rest over 60 months. my credit is great, believe its over 760, so getting a low APR isnt going to be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize I should be buying used, but the car is new and there isnt any used ones for sale yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any input is great. I dont have anyone else to turn to about my finances. Mom is pretty clueless, but she does think I should be buying a used car to reduce depreciation. That was her only input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;

It seems pretty stupid to assume people cant use more than 30% for their housing payment... Is every company actually going to be that way? Making sure my score is 720+ before applying.

I come from an abusive household, and my parents don’t contribute out of spite. They are technically very able to contribute but chose not to. They also both suffer from severe unaddressed mental illness However they do not want to state this on my student loan form so I am entitled to the minimum loan of £5500 a year to live on, which in my city is impossible. 

They also forced me to live in a convent - I can’t get out because this place costs about £7500 a year to live in. In this city the absolute lowest rent prices are £9000. Luckily my school offered a grant of £3000 to supplement my student loan. However this was calculated based on my rent, which is way below the margin of anything realistic in the area. That’s how I’m still stuck in the situation. 

I made up the bare difference from thevjobs I had alongside studying (tutoring, babysitting, and upselling 
 designer pieces). However I was never able to get a real job - the cafes and stores wanted someone with experience in these jobs. I was never allowed to get a job before 18 - I went to a boarding school and in holidays my parents refused to let me out of the house. I had no savings and as a result I just haven’t been able to save up to get myself out of the situation. I really tried - many weeks I hardly ate, barely left the house because I could pretty much only afford rent and transport to school. I could eat out from time to time, but definitely couldn’t go out. I missed so many classes that I had to defer an exam to August, but somehow I managed to scrape a really good grade with the 3 other modules - this means I can at least get an internship for next summer which will lead to a real job. But for this year applications are closed.

On top of this I’m at law school, which is incredibly time consuming - there really isn’t time for too many distractions as it is. 

I tried to apply for many paid internships for this summer, but I couldn’t get any of them - I know this is mostly because my first year grades couldn’t get me into the competitive schemes. I otherwise have a very strong track academic record, and already 5 internships at top firms/companies and go to one of the best law schools. However a lot of the other paid internships (non “city” jobs, in-house, fashion-related etc) I applied for were probably put off by the fact that my past experiences were city firms (and they can assume I got them due to connections since I’m only 19). Some of them I failed the online character tests, despite passing numerical and written tests. Others simply didn’t respond, or didn’t give feedback when I asked. Some said I was too shy! 

So on top of my finances I’m now worried about my career but I accepted that I just need the money. But even with the lower requirement jobs, in retail and service, experience was needed. I have to move out of the convent in 2 weeks and I literally have no money. For the past few weeks I have been babysitting for my sister who is kind to be paying me £8 an hour (she knows my parents have abandoned me and the full extent of the situation but isn’t fully willing/able to help out. She’s pregnant and has an 8 month old baby). From this job I don’t actually make a profit unless I work for 4 hours at a time, because of transport costs. And usually she only wants 3 hours. 

Her husband of 2 months, who has known of me for only 2 years, and does not know me at all, keeps insinuating that I’m only in university to keep my parents happy and I should just quit- he works in sales and didn’t go to university. My sister works in finance and is the higher earner by a lot, however with maternity leave pay she is obviously the lower earner). 
For me, dropping out is out of the question - I worked very hard to get into this university. I know that even if I graduate with the worst grades here, it is still a big deal to have attended and graduated. However, I am much more capable and still ambitious and I still want to do really well and I have a lot of specific goals I want to realise. I have a business idea I’m working on for example, and it’s something I’ve wanted since I was 12. But right now I’m slipping to a point where I’m living “paycheck to paycheck” and hardly being paid at all. I also have to leave the convent, and I’m 3 weeks behind on rent, and have no place to go. I also have an exam in 6 weeks. 

I am actually formally trying to apply as an independent student for the next academic year so I can get a realistic student loan - this. Basically involves me cutting off my parents. I also need proof of why/how I’m estranged but because of certain circumstances it’s close to impossible. I tried to get a doctors note as supporting evidence but the note he gave was almost sarcastic because I still “seem” privileged.
